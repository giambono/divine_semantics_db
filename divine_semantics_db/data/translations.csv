1;1;1-3;"Midway in the journey of our life I found
myself in a dark wood, for the straight way
was lost.";singleton
1;1;4-6;"Ah, how hard it is to tell what that
wood was, wild, rugged, harsh; the very
thought of it renews the fear!";singleton
1;1;7-9;"It is so bitter
that death is hardly more so. But, to treat of
the good that I found in it, I will tell of the
other things I saw there.";singleton
1;1;10-12;"I cannot rightly say how I entered it, I was
so full of sleep at the moment I left the true
way;";singleton
1;1;13-15;"but when I had reached the foot of a
hill, there at the end of the valley that had
pierced my heart with fear,";singleton
1;1;16-18;"I looked up and
saw its shoulders already clad in the rays of
the planet that leads men aright by every path.";singleton
1;1;19-21;"Then the fear was somewhat quieted that had
continued in the lake of my heart through the
night I had passed so piteously.";singleton
1;1;22-24;"And as he
who with laboring breath has escaped from
the deep to the shore turns to look back on
the dangerous waters,";singleton
1;1;25-27;"so my mind which was
still fleeing turned back to gaze upon the pass
that never left anyone alive.";singleton
1;1;28-30;"After I had rested my tired body a little, I
again took up my way across the desert
strand, so that the firm foot was always the
lower.";singleton
1;1;31-33;"And behold, near the beginning of the
steep, a leopard light-footed and very fleet,
covered with a spotted hide!";singleton
1;1;34-36;"And it did not
depart from before my eyes, but did so im-
pede my way that more than once I turned
round to go back.";singleton
1;1;37-39;"It was the beginning of the morning, and
the sun was mounting with the stars that were
with it when Divine Love ";singleton
1;1;40-42;"first set those beautiful things in motion, so that the hour of the
day and the sweet season gave me cause for
good hope of that beast with the gay skin;";singleton
1;1;43-45;"yet not so much that I did not feel afraid
at the sight of a lion ";singleton
1;1;46-48;"that appeared to me and
seemed to be coming at me, head high and
raging with hunger, so that the air seemed
to tremble at it; ";singleton
1;1;49-51;"and a she-wolf, that in her
leanness seemed laden with every craving and
had already caused many to live in sorrow:";singleton
1;1;52-54;"she put such
heaviness upon me with the fear that came
from sight of her that I lost hope of the height.";singleton
1;1;55-57;"And like one who is eager in winning, but,
when the time comes that makes him lose,
weeps and is saddened in all his thoughts,";singleton
1;1;58-60;"such did that peaceless beast make me, as,
coming on against me, she pushed me back,
little by little, to where the sun is silent.";singleton
1;1;61-63;"While I was ruining down to the depth
there appeared before me one who seemed
faint through long silence.";singleton
1;1;64-66;"When I saw him
in that vast desert, I cried to him, “Have pity
on me whatever you are, shade or living
man!”";singleton
1;1;67-69;"“No, not a living man, though once I was,”
he answered me, “and my parents were Lom-
bards, both Mantuans by birth.";singleton
1;1;70-72;"I was born
sub Julio, although late, and I lived at Rome
under the good Augustus, in the time of the
false and lying gods.";singleton
1;1;73-75;"I was a poet, and I sang
of that just son of Anchises who came from
Troy after proud Ilium was burned.";singleton
1;1;76-78;"But you,
why do you return to so much woe? Why do
you not climb the delectable mountain, the
source and cause of every happiness?”";singleton
1;1;79-81;"“Are you, then, that Virgil, that fount
which pours forth so broad a stream of
speech?” I answered him, my brow covered
with shame.";singleton
1;1;82-84;"“O glory and light of other poets,
may the long study and the great love that
have made me search your volume avail me!";singleton
1;1;85-87;"You are my master and my author. You alone
are he from whom I took the fair style that
has done me honor.";singleton
1;1;88-90;"See the beast that has
turned me back. Help me against her, famous
sage, for she makes my veins and pulses
tremble.”";singleton
1;1;91-93;"“It behooves you to go by another way if
you would escape from this wild place,” he
answered when he saw me weep,";singleton
1;1;94-96;"“for this
beast, the cause of your complaint, lets no
man pass her way, but so besets him that she
slays him;";singleton
1;1;97-99;"and she has a nature so vicious and
malign that she never sates her greedy appe-
tite and after feeding is hungrier than before.";singleton
1;1;100-102;"Many are the beasts with which she mates,
and there will yet be more, until the Hound
shall come who will deal her a painful death.";singleton
1;1;103-105;"He will not feed on earth or pelf, but on wis-
dom, love, and virtue, and his birth shall be
between felt and felt.";singleton
1;1;106-108;"He shall be the salvation
of that low-lying Italy for which the virgin
Camilla and Euryalus, Turnus, and Nisus
died of their wounds.";singleton
1;1;109-111;"He shall hunt her through every town till he
has thrust her back into Hell, whence envy
first sent her forth.";singleton
1;1;112-114;"Therefore I think and
deem it best that you should follow me, and
I will be your guide and lead you hence
through an eternal place,";singleton
1;1;115-117;"where you shall
hear the despairing shrieks and see the an-
cient tormented spirits who all bewail the
second death.";singleton
1;1;118-120;"Then you shall see those who
are content in the fire because they hope
to come among the blessed, whensoever that
may be;";singleton
1;1;121-123;"and to these if you would then as-
cend, there shall be a soul worthier than I
to guide you; with her I shall leave you at my
departing.";singleton
1;1;124-126;"For the Emperor who reigns there-
above wills not that I come into His city,
because I was rebellious to His law.";singleton
1;1;127-129;"In all
parts is His empire, in that part is His king-
dom, there is His city and His lofty seat.
Oh, happy he whom He elects thereto!”";singleton
1;1;130-132;"And I to him, “Poet, I beseech you, by that
God whom you did not know, so that I may
escape this ill and worse,";singleton
1;1;133-135;"lead me whither
you said just now, that I may see St. Peter’s
gate and those whom you term so woeful.”";singleton
1;1;136-136;Then he set out, and I followed after him.;singleton
1;2;1-3;"Day was departing, and the dark air was | taking the creatures on earth from their labors; | and I alone";singleton
1;2;4-6;was making ready to sustain the strife, both of the journey | and of the pity, which unerring memory | shall retrace.;singleton
1;2;7-9;O Muses, O high genius, help me now! | O memory that wrote down what I saw, | here shall your worthiness appear!;singleton
1;2;10-12;I began, “Poet, you who guide me, | consider if my strength is sufficient, | before you trust me to the deep way.;singleton
1;2;13-15;You tell how the father of Silvius | went, while still mortal, to the immortal world | and was there in his bodily senses.;singleton
1;2;16-18;But that the Adversary of all evil | should show him such favor considering the high effect that was to spring from him and who and what he was;singleton
1;2;19-21;"seems not unfitting | to an understanding mind, for in the Empyrean heaven he was chosen as
father of glorious Rome and of her empire,";singleton
1;2;22-24; and both, to say the truth, were established | as the holy place where the successor of great Peter has his seat.;singleton
1;2;25-27;In this journey, which you affirm he made, | he learned things that were the cause | of his victory and of the papal mantle.;singleton
1;2;28-30;Later, the Chosen Vessel went there, | that he might bring thence confirmation of that faith | which is the beginning of the way of salvation.;singleton
1;2;31-33;"But I, why do I come there? And who allows it? | I am not Aeneas, I am not Paul; | of this neither I nor others think me worthy.";singleton
1;2;34-36;"Wherefore, if I yield and come, I fear | that the coming may be folly. You are wise; | you understand better than I explain it.”";singleton
1;2;37-39;And like one who unwills what he has willed | and with new thoughts changes his resolve, | so that he quite gives up the thing he had begun,;singleton
1;2;40-42;such did I become on that dark slope, | for by thinking on it I rendered null | the undertaking that had been so suddenly embarked upon.;singleton
1;2;43-45;“If I have well understood what you say,” | the shade of that magnanimous one replied, | “your spirit is beset by cowardice,;singleton
1;2;46-48;which oftentimes encumbers a man, | turning him from honorable endeavor, | as false seeing turns a beast that shies.;singleton
1;2;49-51;To free you from this fear I will tell you | why I came and what it was I heard | when I first felt pity for you.;singleton
1;2;52-54;I was among those who are suspended, | and a lady called me, so blessed and so fair | that I prayed her to command me.;singleton
1;2;55-57;Her eyes were more resplendent than the stars, | and she began to say to me, sweetly and softly, | in an angelic voice,;singleton
1;2;58-60;‘O courteous Mantuan spirit, | whose fame still lasts in the world, | and shall last as long as the world,;singleton
1;2;61-63;my friend—and not the friend of Fortune— | finds his way so impeded on the desert slope | that he has turned back in fright;singleton
1;2;64-66;and, from what I have heard of him in Heaven, | I fear he may already have gone so astray | that I am late in arising to help him.;singleton
1;2;67-69;Go now, and with your fair speech | and with whatever is needful for his deliverance, | assist him so that it may console me.;singleton
1;2;70-72;I am Beatrice who send you. | I come from a place to which I long to return. | Love moved me and makes me speak.;singleton
1;2;73-75;"When I am before my Lord | I will often praise you to Him.’ | Then she was silent; and I began,";singleton
1;2;76-78;‘O Lady of virtue, through whom alone mankind | rises beyond all that is contained | by the heaven that circles least,;singleton
1;2;79-81;your command so pleases me, | that had I obeyed already it would be late. | You have only to declare your will to me.;singleton
1;2;82-84;But tell me the reason why you are not wary | of descending to this center from that spacious region | to which you long to return.’;singleton
1;2;85-87;‘Since you wish to know so deeply,’ | she answered me, ‘I will tell you briefly | why I am not afraid to come within this place.;singleton
1;2;88-90;Those things alone should be feared | that have power to do one harm— | not other things, for they are not fearful.;singleton
1;2;91-93;I am made such by God, of His grace, | that your suffering does not touch me, | and no flame of this burning assails me.;singleton
1;2;94-96;In Heaven there is a gracious lady | who has such pity of this impediment | to which I send you that stern judgment is broken there-above.;singleton
1;2;97-99;She called Lucy, in her request, and said, | “Your faithful one has need of you now, | and I commend him to you.”;singleton
1;2;100-102;Lucy, foe of every cruelty, arose | and, coming to where I sat with ancient Rachel, ;singleton
1;2;103-105;said, “Beatrice, true praise of God, why do you not succor him who bore you such love | that for you he left the vulgar throng? ;singleton
1;2;106-108;Do you not hear his pitiful lament? Do you not see the death that assails him | on that flood over which the sea | has no vaunt?”;singleton
1;2;109-111;On earth no one was ever so swift | to seize advantage or to flee from harm | as I was when these words were uttered,;singleton
1;2;112-114;to come down here from my blessed seat— | trusting in your noble speech, | which honors you and all who have heard it.’;singleton
1;2;115-117;"When she had said this to me, she turned | her eyes, which shone with tears, | making me the more eager to come;";singleton
1;2;118-120;and so, even as she wished, I came to you, | and rescued you from the beast | that was preventing your going the short way up the fair mountain.;singleton
1;2;121-123;What, then, is this? Why, why do you hold back? | Why do you harbor such cowardice in your heart? | Why are you not bold and free,;singleton
1;2;124-126;when in Heaven’s court three such blessed ladies | are mindful of you, | and my words pledge you so great a good?”;singleton
1;2;127-129;As little flowers, bent down and closed | by chill of night, straighten and all unfold | upon their stems when the sun brightens them,;singleton
1;2;130-132;"such in my faint strength did I become; | and so much good courage rushed to my heart | that I began, as one set free,";singleton
1;2;133-135;“Oh, how compassionate was she who helped me, | and how courteous were you, | so quick to obey the true words she spoke to you!;singleton
1;2;136-138;By your words you have made me | so eager to come with you | that I have returned to my first resolve.;singleton
1;2;139-141;"Now on, for a single will is in us both; | you are my leader, you my master and my teacher.” | So I said to him, and when he moved on,";singleton
1;2;142-142;I entered along the deep and savage way.;singleton
1;3;1-3;Through me you enter the woeful city, through me you enter eternal grief, through me you enter among the lost.;singleton
1;3;4-6;Justice moved my high maker: the divine power made me, the supreme wisdom, and the primal love.;singleton
1;3;7-9;Before me nothing was created, if not eternal, and eternal I endure. Abandon every hope, you who enter.;singleton
1;3;10-12;"These words of obscure color I saw inscribed over a portal; whereupon I said, “Master, their meaning is hard for me.”";singleton
1;3;13-15;"And he to me, as one who understands, “Here must all fear be left behind; here let all cowardice be dead.";singleton
1;3;16-18;We have come to the place where I have told you you will see the wretched people who have lost the good of intellect.”;singleton
1;3;19-21;And when he had placed his hand on mine, with a cheerful look from which I took comfort, he led me among the secret things.;singleton
1;3;22-24;Here sighs, laments, and loud wailings were resounding through the starless air, so that at first they made me weep.;singleton
1;3;25-27;Strange tongues, horrible outcries, utterances of woe, accents of anger, voices shrill and faint, and the beating of hands among them.;singleton
1;3;28-30;They were making a tumult that swirls unceasingly in that dark and timeless air, like sand when a whirlwind blows.;singleton
1;3;31-33;And I, my head circled with error, said, “Master, what is this I hear? And what people are these who seem so overcome by pain?”;singleton
1;3;34-36;And he to me, “Such is the miserable condition of the sorry souls of those who lived without infamy and without praise.”;singleton
1;3;37-39;They are mingled with that base band of angels who were neither rebellious nor faithful to God, but stood apart.;singleton
1;3;40-42;"The heavens drive them out, so as not to be less beautiful; and deep Hell does not receive them, lest the wicked have some glory over them.";singleton
1;3;43-45;And I, “Master, what is so grievous to them that it makes them lament so bitterly?” He answered, “Very briefly I will tell you.”;singleton
1;3;46-48;“These have no hope of death, and their blind life is so abject that they are envious of every other lot.;singleton
1;3;49-51;The world does not suffer that report of them shall live. Mercy and justice disdain them. Let us not speak of them, but look, and pass on.”;singleton
1;3;52-54;Looking again, I saw a banner that ran so fast, whirling about, that it seemed it might never have rest.;singleton
1;3;55-57;Behind it came so long a train of people that I should never have believed death had undone so many.;singleton
1;3;58-60;After I had recognized some among them, I saw and knew the shade of him who from cowardice made the great refusal.;singleton
1;3;61-63;Straightway I understood and knew for certain that this was the sorry sect of those who are displeasing to God and to his enemies.;singleton
1;3;64-66;These wretches, who never were alive, were naked and were much stung by gadflies and wasps there.;singleton
1;3;67-69;Which were streaking their faces with blood that mingled with their tears and was gathered by loathsome worms at their feet.;singleton
1;3;70-72;"Then, directing my gaze farther on, I saw people at the shore of a great river; wherefore I said, “Master, now grant that I may know.”";singleton
1;3;73-75;Who these are, and what law makes them seem so ready to cross over, as I discern through the dim light.;singleton
1;3;76-78;And he to me, “These things will be made known to you when we stay our steps at the dismal stream of Acheron.”;singleton
1;3;79-81;Then, with eyes downcast and ashamed, fearing that my words had displeased him, I refrained from speaking till we reached the river.;singleton
1;3;82-84;And behold, an old man, his hair white with age, coming towards us in a boat and shouting, “Woe to you, wicked souls!;singleton
1;3;85-87;Do not hope to see Heaven ever! I come to carry you to the other shore, into eternal darkness, into fire and cold.”;singleton
1;3;88-90;And you there, living soul, stand aside from these that are dead.” But when he saw that I did not do so, ;singleton
1;3;91-93;he said, “By another way.” By other ports, not here, you shall cross to shore. A lighter bark must carry you.;singleton
1;3;94-96;"And my leader to him, “Charon, do not rage. Thus is it willed there where that can be done which is willed; and ask no more.”";singleton
1;3;97-99;Thereon the grizzled cheeks of the ferryman of the livid marsh, who had wheels of flame about his eyes, were quiet.;singleton
1;3;100-102;But those forlorn and naked souls changed color, their teeth chattering, as soon as they heard the cruel words.;singleton
1;3;103-105;They cursed God, their parents, the human race, the place, the time, the seed of their begetting and of their birth.;singleton
1;3;106-108;Then, weeping loudly, all drew to the evil shore that awaits every man who fears not God.;singleton
1;3;109-111;The demon Charon, his eyes like glowing coals, beckons to them and collects them all, beating with his oar whoever lingers.;singleton
1;3;112-114;As the leaves fall away in autumn, one after another, till the bough sees all its spoils upon the ground.;singleton
1;3;115-117;So there the evil seed of Adam: one by one they cast themselves from that shore at signals, like a bird at its call.;singleton
1;3;118-120;Thus they go over the dark water, and before they have landed on the other shore, on this side a new throng gathers.;singleton
1;3;121-123;“My son,” said the courteous master, “those who die in the wrath of God all come together here from every land.;singleton
1;3;124-126;And they are eager to cross the stream, for Divine Justice so spurs them that their fear is changed to desire.”;singleton
1;3;127-129;"No good soul ever passes this way; therefore, if Charon complains of you, you can now well understand the meaning of his words.";singleton
1;3;130-132;When he had ended, the gloomy plain shook so violently that even now the memory of my terror bathes me in sweat.;singleton
1;3;133-135;The tear-soaked ground gave forth a wind that flashed a crimson light which overcame all my senses, ;singleton
1;3;136-136;and I fell like one who is seized by sleep.;singleton
1;4;1-3;"A heavy thunderclap broke the deep sleep in my head, so that I started like one who is awakened by force;";singleton
1;4;4-6;and, standing up, I moved my rested eyes around, gazing intently to make out the place where I was.;singleton
1;4;7-9;True it is that I found myself on the brink of the chasm of pain, which holds the clamor of endless wailings.;singleton
1;4;10-12;It was so dark and deep and misty that, though I peered intently down into the depth, I could make out nothing there.;singleton
1;4;13-15;“Let us descend now into the blind world here below,” the poet began, all pale. “I will be first, and you second.” ;singleton
1;4;16-18;And I, noting his pallor, said, “How shall I come, if you are afraid, who are wont to encourage me when I hesitate?” ;singleton
1;4;19-21;And he to me, “The anguish of the people here below paints my face with the pity that you take for fear. ;singleton
1;4;22-24;Let us go, for the long way urges us.” So he entered, and had me enter, the first circle that girds the abyss.;singleton
1;4;25-27;"Here there was no plaint, that could be heard, except of sighs, which caused the eternal air to tremble;";singleton
1;4;28-30;and this arose from the sadness, without torments, of the crowds that were many and great, both of children and of women and men.;singleton
1;4;31-33;The good master said to me, “Do you not ask what spirits are these that you see? Now, before you go farther, I will have you know ;singleton
1;4;34-36;"that they did not sin; but if they have merit, that does not suffice, for they did not have baptism, which is the portal of the faith you hold;";singleton
1;4;37-39;and if they were before Christianity, they did not worship God aright, and I myself am one of these.;singleton
1;4;40-42;Because of these shortcomings, and for no other fault, we are lost, and only so far afflicted that without hope we live in longing.”;singleton
1;4;43-45;Great sadness seized my heart when I heard him, for I recognized that people of great worth were suspended in that Limbo.;singleton
1;4;46-48;“Tell me, master, tell me, sir,” I began, wishing to be assured of the faith that conquers every error.;singleton
1;4;49-51;“Did ever anyone go forth from here, either by his own or by another’s merit, who afterwards was blessed?” And he, who understood my covert speech, ;singleton
1;4;52-54;replied, “I was new in this condition when I saw a Mighty One come here, crowned with sign of victory.;singleton
1;4;55-57;He took hence the shade of our first parent, Abel his son, and Noah, and Moses, obedient giver of laws,;singleton
1;4;58-60;Abraham the patriarch and David the king, Israel with his father and his children and with Rachel, for whom he did so much,;singleton
1;4;61-63;"and many others; and He made them blessed. And I would have you know that before these no human souls were saved.”";singleton
1;4;64-66;"We did not cease going on because he spoke, but all the while were passing through the wood, I mean the wood of thronging spirits;";singleton
1;4;67-69;nor had we yet gone far from the place of my slumber when I saw a fire, which overcame a hemisphere of darkness.;singleton
1;4;70-72;We were still a little distant from it, yet not so far but that I might in part discern that honorable folk possessed this place.;singleton
1;4;73-75;“O you who honor science and art, who are these that have such honor that it sets them apart from the condition of the rest?”;singleton
1;4;76-78;And he to me, “Their honored fame, which resounds in your life above, wins grace in Heaven, which thus advances them.”;singleton
1;4;79-81;Meanwhile I heard a voice which said, “Honor the great Poet! His shade, which had departed, now returns.”;singleton
1;4;82-84;After the voice had ceased and was still, I saw four great shades coming to us, in semblance neither sad nor joyful.;singleton
1;4;85-87;The good master began, “Note him there with sword in hand who comes before the other three as their lord.;singleton
1;4;88-90;"He is Homer, sovereign poet; next is Horace, satirist; Ovid comes third, and Lucan last.";singleton
1;4;91-93;Since each shares with me the name the single voice has uttered, they do me honor, and in that they do well.”;singleton
1;4;94-96;Thus I saw assembled the fair school of that lord of highest song who, like an eagle, soars above the rest.;singleton
1;4;97-99;"After they had talked awhile together, they turned to me with sign of salutation, at which my master smiled;";singleton
1;4;100-102;and far more honor still they showed me, for they made me one of their company, so that I was sixth amid so much wisdom.;singleton
1;4;103-105;Thus we went onward to the light, talking of things it is well to pass in silence, even as it was well to speak of them there.;singleton
1;4;106-108;We came to the foot of a noble castle, seven times encircled by lofty walls and defended round about by a fair stream.;singleton
1;4;109-111;This we crossed, as on solid ground, and through seven gates I entered with these sages. We came to a meadow of fresh verdure, ;singleton
1;4;112-114;where there were people with grave and slow-moving eyes and looks of great authority. They spoke seldom and with gentle voices.;singleton
1;4;115-117;Then we drew to one side, into an open place which was luminous and high, so that we could see all of them. ;singleton
1;4;118-120;There before me, on the enameled green, the great spirits were shown to me, so that I glory within me for having seen them. ;singleton
1;4;121-123;I saw Electra with many companions, among whom I knew Hector, and Aeneas, and falcon-eyed Caesar armed.;singleton
1;4;124-126;"I saw Camilla and Penthesilea; and on the other side I saw King Latinus, who sat with his daughter Lavinia.";singleton
1;4;127-129;I saw that Brutus who drove out the Tarquin, I saw Lucretia, Julia, Marcia, and Cornelia.;singleton
1;4;130-132;And by himself apart I saw Saladin. When I raised my eyes a little higher, I saw the Master of those who know, seated in a philosophic family.;singleton
1;4;133-135;All look to him, all do him honor. There, nearest to him and in front of the rest, I saw Socrates and Plato.;singleton
1;4;136-138;I saw Democritus, who ascribes the world to chance, Diogenes, Anaxagoras, and Thales, Empedocles, Heraclitus, and Zeno. ;singleton
1;4;139-141;I saw the good collector of the qualities of things—I mean Dioscorides— and I saw Orpheus, Tully, Linus, and Seneca the moralist.;singleton
1;4;142-144;Euclid the geometer, and Ptolemy, Hippocrates, Avicenna, Galen, and Averroés, who made the great commentary.;singleton
1;4;145-147;I cannot give full account of them all, for my long theme so drives me on, that many times the telling comes short of the fact.;singleton
1;4;148-150;"The company of six diminishes to two; by another way my wise guide leads me, out of the quiet, into the trembling air.";singleton
1;4;151-151;And I come to a part where there is naught that shines.;singleton
1;5;1-3;Thus I descended from the first circle into the second, which girds less space, and so much greater woe that it goads to wailing.;singleton
1;5;4-6;There stands Minos, horrible and snarling: upon the entrance he examines their offenses, and judges and dispatches them according as he entwines.;singleton
1;5;7-9;"I mean that when the ill-begotten soul comes before him, it confesses all; and that discerner of sins sees which shall be its place in Hell, then girds himself with his tail as many times as the grades he wills that it be sent down.";singleton
1;5;10-12;"Always before him stands a crowd of them; they go, each in his turn, to the judgment; they tell, and hear, and then are hurled below.";singleton
1;5;13-15;“O you who come to the abode of pain,” said Minos to me, when he saw me, pausing in the act of that great office,;singleton
1;5;16-18;"“beware how you enter and in whom you trust; let not the breadth of the entrance deceive you!”";singleton
1;5;19-21;"And my leader to him, “Why do you too cry out? Do not hinder his fated going: thus is it willed there where that can be done which is willed; and ask no more.”";singleton
1;5;22-24;"Now the doleful notes begin to reach me; now I am come where much wailing smites me.";singleton
1;5;25-27;I came into a place mute of all light, which bellows like the sea in tempest when it is assailed by warring winds.;singleton
1;5;28-30;"The hellish hurricane, never resting, sweeps along the spirits with its rapine; whirling and smiting, it torments them.";singleton
1;5;31-33;"When they arrive before the ruin, there the shrieks, the moans, the lamentations; there they curse the divine power.";singleton
1;5;34-36;I learned that to such torment are condemned the carnal sinners, who subject reason to desire.;singleton
1;5;37-39;And as their wings bear the starlings along in the cold season, in wide, dense flocks,;singleton
1;5;40-42;"so does that blast the sinful spirits; hither, thither, downward, upward, it drives them.";singleton
1;5;43-45;No hope of less pain, not to say of rest, ever comforts them.;singleton
1;5;46-48;And as the cranes go chanting their lays, making a long line of themselves in the air,;singleton
1;5;49-51;"so I saw shades come, uttering wails, borne by that strife; wherefore I said, “Master, who are these people that are so lashed by the black air?”";singleton
1;5;52-54;“The first of these of whom you wish to know,” he said to me then, “was empress of many tongues.;singleton
1;5;55-57;She was so given to lechery that she made lust licit in her law, to take away the blame she had incurred.;singleton
1;5;58-60;She is Semiramis, of whom we read that she succeeded Ninus and had been his wife: she held the land the Sultan rules.;singleton
1;5;61-63;"The next is she who slew herself for love and broke faith to the ashes of Sichaeus; next is wanton Cleopatra.";singleton
1;5;64-66;"See Helen, for whom so many years of ill revolved; and see the great Achilles, who fought at the last with love.";singleton
1;5;67-69;See Paris, Tristan, and more than a thousand shades whom love had parted from our life he showed me, pointing them out and naming them.;singleton
1;5;70-72;When I heard my teacher name the ladies and the knights of old, pity overcame me and I was as one bewildered.;singleton
1;5;73-75;“Poet,” I began, “willingly would I speak with those two that go together and seem to be so light upon the wind.”;singleton
1;5;76-78;"And he to me, “You shall see when they are nearer to us; and do you entreat them then by that love which leads them, and they will come.”";singleton
1;5;79-81;As soon as the wind bends them to us, I raised my voice, “O wearied souls! come speak with us, if Another forbid it not.”;singleton
1;5;82-84;As doves called by desire, with wings raised and steady, come through the air, borne by their will to their sweet nest,;singleton
1;5;85-87;so did these issue from the troop where Dido is, coming to us through the malignant air, such force had my compassionate cry.;singleton
1;5;88-90;“O living creature, gracious and benign, that go through the black air visiting us who stained the world with blood,;singleton
1;5;91-93;if the King of the universe were friendly to us, we would pray Him for your peace, since you have pity on our perverse ill.;singleton
1;5;94-96;Of that which it pleases you to hear and to speak, we will hear and speak with you, while the wind, as now, is silent for us.;singleton
1;5;97-99;The city where I was born lies on that shore where the Po descends to be at peace with its followers.;singleton
1;5;100-102;Love, which is quickly kindled in a gentle heart, seized this one for the fair form that was taken from me—and the way of it afflicts me still.;singleton
1;5;103-105;Love, which absolves no loved one from loving, seized me so strongly with delight in him, that, as you see, it does not leave me even now.;singleton
1;5;106-108;Love brought us to one death. Caina awaits him who quenched our life.”;singleton
1;5;109-111;These words were borne to us from them.;singleton
1;5;112-114;And when I heard those afflicted souls I bowed my head and held it bowed until the poet said to me, “What are you thinking of?”;singleton
1;5;115-117;When I answered, I began, “Alas! How many sweet thoughts, what great desire, brought them to the woeful pass!”;singleton
1;5;118-120;"Then I turned again to them, and I began, “Francesca, your torments make me weep for grief and pity; but tell me, in the time of the sweet sighs,";singleton
1;5;121-123;by what and how did Love grant you to know the dubious desires?”;singleton
1;5;124-126;"And she to me, “There is no greater sorrow than to recall, in wretchedness, the happy time; and this your teacher knows.";singleton
1;5;127-129;But if you have such great desire to know the first root of our love, I will tell as one who weeps and tells.;singleton
1;5;130-132;"One day, for pastime, we read of Lancelot, how love constrained him; we were alone, suspecting nothing.";singleton
1;5;133-135;Several times that reading urged our eyes to meet and took the color from our faces, but one moment alone it was that overcame us.;singleton
1;5;136-138;When we read how the longed-for smile was kissed by so great a lover, this one, who never shall be parted from me, kissed my mouth all trembling.;singleton
1;5;139-141;"A Gallehault was the book and he who wrote it; that day we read no farther in it.";singleton
1;5;142-142;While the one spirit said this, the other wept, so that for pity I swooned, as if in death, and fell as a dead body falls.;singleton
1;6;1-3;At the return of my mind, which had closed before the pity of the two kinsmen, who filled me with sadness and left me dazed.;singleton
1;6;4-6;New torments and new tormented souls, I see around me, whichever way I move, whichever way I turn, and whichever way I gaze.;singleton
1;6;7-9;"I am in the third circle, of the rain, eternal, accursed, heavy, and cold; its measure and its kind are never new.";singleton
1;6;10-12;"Huge hail, dark water, and snow pour down through the murky, heavy air; the ground that takes it in gives off a stench.";singleton
1;6;13-15;Cerberus, savage beast, strange and cruel, barks dog-like with three throats above the people submerged in this place.;singleton
1;6;16-18;"His eyes are red, his beard is black and greasy, his belly is broad, his hands are clawed; he rakes the souls, he flays, he quarters them.";singleton
1;6;19-21;"The rain makes them howl like dogs in pain; one wretch shields himself behind the next, turning and twisting in their miserable plight.";singleton
1;6;22-24;When Cerberus, the monstrous worm, caught sight of us, he opened his jaws, showed us his fangs, and shook in every limb.;singleton
1;6;25-27;Then my leader stretched his open hands, scooped up earth, and with full fists, he threw it into those ravenous mouths.;singleton
1;6;28-30;As a dog that barks and fiercely craves, but calms itself once it snatches its food, fighting and struggling only to devour it,;singleton
1;6;31-33;So did those filthy demon faces turn, the faces of Cerberus, who thunders so, that souls would wish they could be deaf.;singleton
1;6;34-36;We passed above the shadows laid low by the heavy rain, setting our feet upon their emptiness that seemed solid.;singleton
1;6;37-39;They all lay sprawled across the ground, except for one, who quickly rose to sit, as soon as he saw us passing by.;singleton
1;6;40-42;"“O you, led through this hellish place,” he said to me, “if you can, recognize me; you were made before I was unmade.”";singleton
1;6;43-45;And I to him: “Your pain may well have taken you from my memory, so that I do not recall having seen you.;singleton
1;6;46-48;But tell me who you are, who are placed in such a sorrowful, woeful spot, where, if any is worse, none is more loathsome.”;singleton
1;6;49-51;And he to me: “Your city, so full of envy, that already its sack overflows, held me in it during the bright life.;singleton
1;6;52-54;You citizens called me Ciacco: for the deadly fault of gluttony, as you see, I am broken by the rain.;singleton
1;6;55-57;"And yet, in misery, I am not alone; for all of these endure the same, punished alike for the same sin.”";singleton
1;6;58-60;"I answered him: “Ciacco, your suffering weighs on me so that it moves me to tears; but tell me, if you know, what will become";singleton
1;6;61-63;of the citizens of the divided city? Is there one just man among them? And why has such discord struck it down?”;singleton
1;6;64-66;And he to me: “After long contention, they will come to blood, and the wild faction shall drive the other out with cruel offense.;singleton
1;6;67-69;Then, within three years, the first will fall, while the other shall rise in victory, by means of one who now treads a middle path.;singleton
1;6;70-72;Long will the victors hold their heads high, keeping their foes beneath heavy burdens, no matter how they weep or feel the shame.;singleton
1;6;73-75;"Two men are just, but they are not heeded; pride, envy, and greed are the three sparks that have set their hearts aflame.”";singleton
1;6;76-78;Here he finished his grievous words. And I to him: “I still would learn more, and have you grant me further speech.;singleton
1;6;79-81;Farinata and Tegghiaio, once so worthy, Jacopo Rusticucci, Arrigo, and Mosca, and the others who pursued the good,;singleton
1;6;82-84;Tell me where they are, and let me know, for I am eager to understand whether Heaven soothes or Hell torments them.”;singleton
1;6;85-87;"And he: “They are among the darkest souls, dragged to the depths by different faults; if you descend that far, you may see them.";singleton
1;6;88-90;"But when you return to the sweet world, I pray you to recall me among men; I tell you no more and answer no more.”";singleton
1;6;91-93;Then he turned his straight eyes askew, looked at me a moment, then bowed his head, and fell down with the others, blind as they.;singleton
1;6;94-96;And my leader said to me: “He wakes no more until the angel’s trumpet sounds, and the mighty foe arrives.;singleton
1;6;97-99;Then each shall find again his mournful tomb, shall take his flesh and form once more, and hear the sound that echoes for eternity.”;singleton
1;6;100-102;Thus we went on through the filthy mixture, of shades and rain, with slow, heavy steps, speaking lightly of things to come.;singleton
1;6;103-105;So I said: “Master, will these torments increase after the Last Judgment, or will they be less, or just the same?”;singleton
1;6;106-108;And he to me: “Return to your learning, which tells you that the more perfect a thing, the more it feels both good and pain.;singleton
1;6;109-111;Although these damned shall never reach true perfection, they will be closer to it then than they are now.”;singleton
1;6;112-114;We circled round that path, speaking much more than I now recount, until we reached the place where the descent begins.;singleton
1;6;115-115;There we found Plutus, the great enemy.;singleton
1;7;1-3;"""Pape Satàn, pape Satàn aleppe!"" Plutus began with a clucking voice; and that gentle sage who knew all said,";singleton
1;7;4-6;"to reassure me, ""Do not let your fear harm you; for, whatever power he has, he shall not keep us from descending this rock.""";singleton
1;7;7-9;"Then he turned back to that bloated visage and said, ""Silence, accursed wolf! Consume yourself inwardly with your own rage.""";singleton
1;7;10-12;"""Not without cause is this journey to the depth; so is it willed on high, there where Michael avenged the proud rebellion.""";singleton
1;7;13-15;As sails swollen by the wind fall in a heap when the mainmast snaps, so fell that cruel beast to the ground.;singleton
1;7;16-18;Thus we descended into the fourth hollow, taking in more of the dismal bank which insacks all the evil of the universe.;singleton
1;7;19-21;Ah, justice of God! Who crams together so many new travails and penalties as I saw? And why does our guilt so waste us?;singleton
1;7;22-24;As does the wave, there over Charybdis, breaking itself against the wave it meets, so must the folk here dance their round.;singleton
1;7;25-27;Here I saw far more people than elsewhere, both on the one side and on the other, howling loudly, rolling weights.;singleton
1;7;28-30;"They clashed together, and then right there each wheeled round, rolling back his weight, shouting, ""Why do you hoard?"" and ""Why do you squander?""";singleton
1;7;31-33;Thus they returned along the gloomy circle on either hand to the opposite point, shouting at each other again their refrain.;singleton
1;7;34-36;Then, having reached that point, each turned back through his half-circle to the next joust. And I, heart-wrung at this,;singleton
1;7;37-39;" said, ""Master, now declare to me who are these people, and if all these tonsured ones on our left were clerics.""";singleton
1;7;40-42;"And he to me, ""Each and all of these were so asquint of mind in the first life that they followed there no right measure in their spending.""";singleton
1;7;43-45;Most clearly do they bark this out when they come to the two points of the circle where opposite fault divides them.;singleton
1;7;46-48;"These who have no covering of hair on their head were clerics, and popes and cardinals, in whom avarice wreaks its excess.""";singleton
1;7;49-51;"And I said, ""Master, among such as these I ought surely to recognize some who were polluted with these evils.""";singleton
1;7;52-54;"And he to me, ""You harbor a vain thought: the undiscerning life that made them foul now makes them dim to all discernment.""";singleton
1;7;55-57;"They will come forever to the two buttings; these will rise from the grave with closed fist, and these with cropped hair.";singleton
1;7;58-60;Ill-giving and ill-keeping have robbed them of the fair world and set them to this scuffle—what that is, I spend no fair words to say.;singleton
1;7;61-63;Now can you see, my son, the brief mockery of the goods that are committed to Fortune, for which humankind contend with one another.;singleton
1;7;64-66;Because all the gold that is beneath the moon, or ever was, would not give rest to a single one of these weary souls.;singleton
1;7;67-69;"""Master,"" I said, ""now tell me further: this Fortune which you touch on here, what is it, which has the goods of the world so in its clutches?""";singleton
1;7;70-72;"And he to me, ""O foolish creatures, how great is the ignorance that besets you! I would have you receive my judgment on this now.""";singleton
1;7;73-75;He whose wisdom transcends all, made the heavens and gave them guides, so that every part shines to every part, ;singleton
1;7;76-78;equally distributing the light. In like manner, for worldly splendors He ordained a general minister and guide;singleton
1;7;79-81; who should in due time transfer the vain goods. From race to race, and from one to another blood, beyond the prevention of human wit, ;singleton
1;7;82-84;so that one race rules and another languishes. Pursuant to her judgment, which is hidden like the snake in the grass.;singleton
1;7;85-87; Your wisdom cannot withstand her. She foresees, judges, and pursues her reign, as theirs the other gods. ;singleton
1;7;88-90;Her changes know no truce. Necessity compels her to be swift, so fast do men come to their turns. ;singleton
1;7;91-93;This is she who is much reviled even by those who ought to praise her. But they wrongfully blame her and defame her. ;singleton
1;7;94-96;But she is blest and does not hear it. Happy with the other primal creatures she turns her sphere and rejoices in her bliss.;singleton
1;7;97-99;"""Now let us descend to greater wretchedness: already every star sinks that was rising when I set out, and to stay overlong is forbidden.""";singleton
1;7;100-102;We crossed the circle to the other edge, above a fount that boils and pours over by a trench leading from it.;singleton
1;7;103-105;"The water was far darker than perse; and we, in company with the murky waves, entered down through a strange way.";singleton
1;7;106-108;This dismal little stream, when it has descended to the foot of the malign gray slopes, flows into the marsh that is named Styx.;singleton
1;7;109-111;And I, who was standing intent to gaze, saw a muddy people in that bog, all naked and with looks of rage.;singleton
1;7;112-114;They were smiting each other not with hand only, but with head and chest and feet, and tearing each other piecemeal with their teeth.;singleton
1;7;115-117;"The good master said, ""Son, you see now the souls of those whom anger overcame."" And I would also have you know for certain";singleton
1;7;118-120; that down under the water are people who sigh and make it bubble at the surface. As your eye tells you wherever it turns.;singleton
1;7;121-123;" Fixed in the slime they say, ""We were sullen in the sweet air that is gladdened by the sun.""";singleton
1;7;124-126;"""Bearing within us the sluggish fumes; now we are sullen in the black mire."" This hymn they gurgle in their throats. For they cannot speak it in full words. ";singleton
1;7;127-129;"Thus we compassed a great arc of that foul pond between the dry bank and the slough. With eyes turned on those that swallow the mire; ";singleton
1;7;130-130;and we came at length to the foot of a tower.;singleton
1;8;1-3;I say, continuing, that long before we had come to the foot of the high tower, our eyes went upward to its summit, ;singleton
1;8;4-6;because of two little flames we saw set there, while yet another returned the signal. So far off that the eye could hardly catch it. ;singleton
1;8;7-9;And I turned to the sea of all wisdom and said, “This one, what does it mean? And that other fire, what does it answer? And who are they that have made it?”;singleton
1;8;10-12;And he to me, “Over the foul waves you can already make out what is expected, if the fumes of the marsh do not hide it from you.”;singleton
1;8;13-15;Bowstring never drove arrow from itself that coursed so swiftly through the air as a little bark I saw come towards us then through the water.;singleton
1;8;16-18;Piloted by a single boatman, who cried, “Now you are caught, fell spirit!” ;singleton
1;8;19-21;“Phlegyas, Phlegyas, this time you shout in vain,” said my lord. “You shall not have us longer than while crossing the mire.”;singleton
1;8;22-24; As one who listens to some great deception that has been practiced on him, and then repines at it, such Phlegyas became in his gathered wrath.;singleton
1;8;25-27;My leader got into the bark, then had me enter after him— and only when I was in it did it seem laden.;singleton
1;8;28-30;As soon as he and I had embarked, the ancient prow moves off, cutting more of the water than it is wont with others.;singleton
1;8;31-33;While we were running through the dead channel, there rose before me one covered with mud, and said, “Who are you that come before your time?”;singleton
1;8;34-36;And I to him, “If I come, I do not remain. But you, who are you that have become so foul?” He answered, “You see that I am one who weeps.”;singleton
1;8;37-39;And I to him, “In weeping and in sorrow do you remain, accursed spirit, for I know you, even if you are all filthy.” ;singleton
1;8;40-42;Then he stretched both his hands to the boat. Whereat the wary master thrust him off, saying, “Away there with the other dogs!” ;singleton
1;8;43-45;Then he put his arms about my neck, kissed my face, and said, “Indignant soul, blessed is she who bore you!”;singleton
1;8;46-48;"“He was an arrogant one in the world. No goodness whatever adorns his memory; so is his shade furious here. ";singleton
1;8;49-51;How many up there now account themselves great kings,” “That here shall lie like swine in mire, leaving behind them horrible dispraises.”;singleton
1;8;52-54; And I, “Master, I should like well to see him soused in this soup, before we quit the lake.”;singleton
1;8;55-57;And he to me, “Before the shore comes into view you shall be satisfied. It is fitting that in such a wish you should be gratified.”;singleton
1;8;58-60;A little after this I saw such rending of him by the muddy folk that I still praise and thank God for it. ;singleton
1;8;61-63;All cried, “At Filippo Argenti!” And the irascible Florentine spirit turned on himself with his teeth. ;singleton
1;8;64-66;"Here we left him, and I tell no more of him; but on my ears smote a sound of wailing, At which I bend my eyes intently forward.";singleton
1;8;67-69; The good master said, “Now, my son, the city that is named Dis draws near, with its grave citizens, with its great garrison.”;singleton
1;8;70-72;And I, “Master, already I distinctly discern its mosques there within the valley, red as if they had come out of the fire.”;singleton
1;8;73-75;And he to me, “The eternal fire that blazes there within makes them show red, as you see, in this nether Hell.”;singleton
1;8;76-78;We came at last into the deep moats entrenching that doleful city. The walls seemed to me to be of iron, ;singleton
1;8;79-81;and not until we had made a great circuit did we come to a place. Where the boatman loudly cried, “Out with you here! This is the entrance.”;singleton
1;8;82-84; Above the gates I saw more than a thousand of those rained down from Heaven, Who cried angrily, “Who is this that without death ;singleton
1;8;85-87;goes through the kingdom of the dead?” And my wise master made a sign that he wished to speak with them apart.;singleton
1;8;88-90;Then they restrained somewhat their great disdain, and said, “You come alone, and let that one depart, who has entered so daringly into this kingdom.”;singleton
1;8;91-93;"“Let him retrace alone his foolish way; try, if he can!—for you shall stay here, who have escorted him through so dark a country.”";singleton
1;8;94-96;Judge, reader, if I did not lose heart at the sound of the accursed words, for I did not think I should ever return here.;singleton
1;8;97-99;“O my dear leader, who seven times and more have restored my confidence and drawn me from great peril confronting me, ;singleton
1;8;100-102;do not leave me thus undone,” I said. “And if going farther is denied us, let us quickly retrace our steps together.”;singleton
1;8;103-105; And that lord who had led me thither said to me, “Do not fear, for no one can take from us our passage, by such a One is it granted us.”;singleton
1;8;106-108;“But wait for me here, and comfort your weary spirit and feed it with good hope, for I will not forsake you in the nether world.”;singleton
1;8;109-111;So he goes away and leaves me there, the gentle father, and I remain in doubt, as yes and no contend within my head.;singleton
1;8;112-114;"I could not hear what he proposed to them; but he was not long there with them when they all scrambled to get back in.";singleton
1;8;115-117;These our adversaries shut the gates in the face of my lord, who remained without and turned back to me with slow steps.;singleton
1;8;118-120;He had his eyes upon the ground, and his brows were shorn of all boldness, and he was saying with sighs, “Who has denied me the abodes of pain?”;singleton
1;8;121-123;And to me he said, “Be not dismayed because of my vexation, for I shall prevail in this, whatever be contrived within to hinder us.”;singleton
1;8;124-126;“This insolence of theirs is nothing new, for they showed it once at a less secret gate, which still stands without a bolt.”;singleton
1;8;127-129;"“Over it you saw the dead inscription; and already, on this side of it, there comes down the steep, passing the circles without escort, ";singleton
1;8;130-130;one by whom the city shall be opened to us.”;singleton
1;9;1-3;That color which cowardice painted outwardly on me, repressed more speedily his own new color. ;singleton
1;9;4-6;He stopped attentive, like a man that listens, for his eye could not lead him far. Through the dark air and the dense fog.;singleton
1;9;7-9; “Yet we must win this fight,” he began, “or else . . . such did she offer herself to us! Oh, how long to me it seems till someone come!”;singleton
1;9;10-12;I saw well how he covered up the beginning with the rest that came after, which were words different from the first. ;singleton
1;9;13-15;But none the less his speech gave me fear. Because I drew his broken phrase perhaps to a worse meaning than it held. ;singleton
1;9;16-18;“Into this depth of the dismal hollow does any ever descend from the first circle?” Where the sole punishment is hope cut off?”;singleton
1;9;19-21;" I asked; and he answered, “It seldom happens that any of us makes the journey on which I go.”";singleton
1;9;22-24;“It is true that once before I was down here, conjured by that cruel Erichtho who was wont to call back shades into their bodies.”;singleton
1;9;25-27;“My flesh had been but short while divested of me, when she made me enter within that wall to draw forth a spirit from the circle of Judas.”;singleton
1;9;28-30;“That is the lowest place, and the darkest, and farthest from the heaven that encircles all. Well do I know the way, so reassure yourself.”;singleton
1;9;31-33;“This marsh, which exhales the mighty stench, girds round the sorrowful city, wherein now we cannot enter without anger.”;singleton
1;9;34-36;And more he said, but I have it not in memory, for my eye had wholly drawn me to the high tower with the glowing summit.;singleton
1;9;37-39;Where all at once three hellish blood-stained Furies had instantly risen up. They had the limbs and bearing of women, ;singleton
1;9;40-42;and they were girt with greenest hydras. For hair they had little serpents and cerastes bound about their savage temples.;singleton
1;9;43-45; And he, who well recognized the handmaids of the queen of eternal lamentation. Said to me, “See the fierce Erinyes!;singleton
1;9;46-48;" That is Megaera on the left; she that wails on the right is Alecto; Tisiphone is in the middle.”";singleton
1;9;49-51;"Each was tearing her breast with her nails; and they were beating themselves with their hands, and crying out so loudly that in fear I pressed close to the poet.";singleton
1;9;52-54;“Let Medusa come and we’ll turn him to stone,” they all cried, looking downward. “Poorly did we avenge the assault of Theseus.”;singleton
1;9;55-57;"“Turn your back, and keep your eyes shut; for should the Gorgon show herself and you see her, there would be no returning above.”";singleton
1;9;58-60;Thus said the master, and he himself turned me round and, not trusting to my hands, covered my face with his own hands as well.;singleton
1;9;61-63;O you who have sound understanding, mark the doctrine that is hidden under the veil of the strange verses!;singleton
1;9;64-66;And now there came over the turbid waves a crash of fearful sound, at which both shores trembled.;singleton
1;9;67-69;A sound as of a wind, violent from conflicting heats, which strikes the forest and with unchecked course shatters the branches.;singleton
1;9;70-72;Beats them down and sweeps them away, haughtily driving onward in its cloud of dust and putting wild beasts and shepherds to flight.;singleton
1;9;73-75;He loosed my eyes, and said, “Now direct your sight across that ancient scum, there where that fume is harshest.”;singleton
1;9;76-78;"As the frogs before their enemy the snake
all vanish through the water, till each cocks
itself on the bottom,";singleton
1;9;79-81;I saw more than a thousand ruined souls flee before one that strode dry-shod over Styx. He was clearing that gross air from before his face.;singleton
1;9;82-84;Often moving his left hand before him, and only with that annoyance did he seem weary. ;singleton
1;9;85-87;Well did I perceive that he was a messenger from Heaven. And I turned to the master, who signed to me that I should stand quiet and bow down to him. ;singleton
1;9;88-90;Ah, how full of disdain he seemed to me! He came to the gate, and with a little wand he opened it, and there was no resistance.;singleton
1;9;91-93; “O outcasts from Heaven, race despised,” he began upon the horrible threshold. “Why is this insolence harbored in you?;singleton
1;9;94-96; Why do you kick against that Will which can never be thwarted of its end, and which many times has increased your pain?”;singleton
1;9;97-99;“What does it avail to butt against the fates? Your Cerberus, if you well remember, still bears his chin and his throat peeled for doing so.”;singleton
1;9;100-102;Then he turned back on the filthy way, and spoke not a word to us. But looked like one whom other care urges and incites ;singleton
1;9;103-105;than that of those who stand before him. Then we moved our steps toward the city, secure after the holy words.;singleton
1;9;106-108; We entered it without any strife. And I, who was eager to behold the condition which such a fortress encloses,;singleton
1;9;109-111; cast my eye round about, as soon as I was in. And on every hand I see a great plain full of woe and of cruel torment;singleton
1;9;112-114;As at Arles, where the Rhone slackens its course, and as at Pola, near the Quarnero, which shuts Italy in and bathes her borders,;singleton
1;9;115-117;"The sepulchers make all the place uneven, so they
did here on every side, save that the manner here was more bitter;";singleton
1;9;118-120;"for among the tombs flames were scattered, whereby they were
made to glow all over, hotter than iron need be for any craft.";singleton
1;9;121-123;"Their covers were all raised up, and such dire laments were issuing forth 
From them as truly seemed to come from people wretched and suffering.";singleton
1;9;124-126;"And I, “Master, what are these people who, buried within these chests, make themselves
heard by their woeful sighs?”";singleton
1;9;127-129;"And he to me, “Here are the heresiarchs with their followers of every sect, and the
tombs are laden far more than you think.";singleton
1;9;130-132;"Like with like is buried here, and the monuments are more and less hot.” 
Then, after he had turned to the right hand,";singleton
1;9;133-133;"
we passed between the tortures and the high
battlements.";singleton
1;10;1-3;Now, along a solitary path between the wall of the city and the torments, my master goes on, and I follow after him.;singleton
1;10;4-6;O supreme virtue, who lead me round as you will through the impious circles, speak to me and satisfy my desires.;singleton
1;10;7-9;Might these people who lie within the sepulchers be seen? Indeed, the covers are all raised, and no one keeps guard. ;singleton
1;10;10-12;And he to me, All shall be closed when from Jehoshaphat they return here with the bodies which they have left above.;singleton
1;10;13-15;In this part Epicurus with all his followers, who make the soul die with the body, have their burial-place. ;singleton
1;10;16-18;Therefore, to the question which you ask me you shall soon have satisfaction here within, and also to the wish which you hold from me.;singleton
1;10;19-21;"And I, “Good leader, I do not keep my heart hidden from you except in order to speak little, and to this you have before now
disposed me.”";singleton
1;10;22-24;O Tuscan, who go alive through the city of fire speaking thus modestly, may it please you to stop in this place.;singleton
1;10;25-27; Your speech clearly shows you a native of that noble fatherland to which I perhaps did too much harm.;singleton
1;10;28-30;Suddenly this sound issued from one of the coffers, whereat in fear I drew a little nearer to my leader. ;singleton
1;10;31-33;And he to me, Turn round! what are you doing? See there Farinata who has risen erect: from the waist upwards you will see him all.;singleton
1;10;34-36;Already I had fixed my eyes on his, and he rose upright with chest and brow thrown back as if he had great scorn of Hell. ;singleton
1;10;37-39;And the bold and ready hands of my leader pushed me between the tombs to him, and he said, Let your words be fitting.;singleton
1;10;40-42;When I was at the foot of his tomb, he looked at me for a moment, then, as if in disdain, asked me, Who were your ancestors? ;singleton
1;10;43-45;"And I, who was eager to obey, concealed nothing, but made all plain to him; whereupon he raised his brows a little.";singleton
1;10;46-48;Then he said, They were fiercely adverse to me and to my forebears and to my party, so that twice over I scattered them. ;singleton
1;10;49-51;If they were driven forth, they returned from every quarter, both times, I answered him, but yours have not learned that art well.;singleton
1;10;52-54;Then there arose to sight alongside of him a shade, visible to the chin. I think he had raised himself on his knees. ;singleton
1;10;55-57;He looked round about me as though he wished to see whether someone was with me, but when his expectation was quite spent, ;singleton
1;10;58-60;he said, weeping. If you go through this blind prison by reason of high genius, where is my son, and why is he not with you?;singleton
1;10;61-63; And I to him, I come not of myself. He who waits yonder, whom perhaps your Guido had in disdain, is leading me through here.;singleton
1;10;64-66;Already his words and the manner of his punishment had read his name to me: hence was my answer so full. ;singleton
1;10;67-69;Suddenly straightening up, he cried, How? Did you say ‘he had’? Does he not still live? Does the sweet light not strike his eyes?;singleton
1;10;70-72;And when he perceived that I made some delay in answering, he fell supine again and showed himself no more. ;singleton
1;10;73-75;But the other, that great soul at whose instance I had stopped, changed not his aspect, nor moved his neck, nor bent his side.;singleton
1;10;76-78;And if, he said, continuing his first discourse, they have ill learned that art, that fact torments me more than this bed. ;singleton
1;10;79-81;But the face of the Lady who rules here will not be kindled fifty times before you shall know how much that art weighs.;singleton
1;10;82-84;And, so may you return some time to the sweet world, tell me, why is that people so fierce against my kindred in all its laws? ;singleton
1;10;85-87;Whereon I to him, The havoc and the great slaughter, which dyed the Arbia red, cause such prayers to be made in our temple.;singleton
1;10;88-90;"He sighed, and shook his head, then said, I was not alone in that, nor surely without cause would I have moved with the others; ";singleton
1;10;91-93;but I was alone there where all agreed to make an end of Florence, the one who defended her before them all.;singleton
1;10;94-96;Ah, so may your seed sometime find peace, I prayed him, solve the knot which has here entangled my judgment. ;singleton
1;10;97-99;It seems, if I hear aright, that you see beforehand what time brings with it, but have a different manner with the present.;singleton
1;10;100-102;"Like one who has bad light, we see the things, he said, which are remote from us: so much does the Supreme Ruler still shine on us; ";singleton
1;10;103-105;"but when they draw near, or are, our intelligence is wholly vain. And unless others bring us word, we know nothing of your human state;";singleton
1;10;106-108; wherefore you can comprehend that all our knowledge will be dead from that moment when the door of the future shall be closed.;singleton
1;10;109-111;Then, compunctious for my fault, I said, Will you, now, tell him who fell back that his son is still among the living? ;singleton
1;10;112-114;And let him know that, if I was silent in response to him before, it was because my thoughts were already in that error which you have resolved for me.;singleton
1;10;115-117;"And now my master was recalling me; wherefore with more haste I begged the spirit to tell me who were there with him; ";singleton
1;10;118-120;"and he said to me, Here I lie with more than a thousand. Here within is the second Frederick, and the Cardinal; and of the rest I do not speak.";singleton
1;10;121-123;" With that he hid himself; and I turned my steps to the ancient poet, thinking on the words that seemed hostile to me.";singleton
1;10;124-126;He set out, and then, as we went, he said to me, Why are you so disturbed? And I satisfied him in his question. ;singleton
1;10;127-129;"Let your memory preserve what you have heard against yourself, that sage bade me. And now give heed here— and he raised his finger;";singleton
1;10;130-132; when you are before her sweet radiance whose fair eyes see all, from her you shall know of your life’s journey.;singleton
1;10;133-135;Then he turned his steps to the left and, leaving the wall, we made our way toward the middle by a path that strikes into a valley ;singleton
1;10;136-136;which even up there annoyed us with its stench.;singleton
1;1;1-3;"Midway along the journey of our life
I woke to find myself in a dark wood,
for I had wandered off from the straight path.";musa
1;1;4-6;"How hard it is to tell what it was like,
this wood of wilderness, savage and stubborn
(the thought of it brings back all my old fears),";musa
1;1;7-9;"a bitter place! Death could scarce be bitterer.
But if I would show the good that came of it
I must talk about things other than the good.";musa
1;1;10-12;"How I entered there I cannot truly say,
I had become so sleepy at the moment
when I first strayed, leaving the path of truth;";musa
1;1;13-15;"but when I found myself at the foot of a hill,
at the edge of the wood’s beginning, down in the valley,
where I first felt my heart plunged deep in fear,";musa
1;1;16-18;"I raised my head and saw the hilltop shawled
in morning rays of light sent from the planet
that leads men straight ahead on every road.";musa
1;1;19-21;"And then only did terror start subsiding
in my heart’s lake, which rose to heights of fear
that night I spent in deepest desperation.";musa
1;1;22-24;"Just as a swimmer, still with panting breath,
now safe upon the shore, out of the deep,
might turn for one last look at the dangerous waters,";musa
1;1;25-27;"so I, although my mind was turned to flee,
turned round to gaze once more upon the pass
that never let a living soul escape.";musa
1;1;28-30;"I rested my tired body there awhile
and then began to climb the barren slope
(I dragged my stronger foot and limped along).";musa
1;1;31-33;"Beyond the point the slope begins to rise
sprang up a leopard, trim and very swift!
It was covered by a pelt of many spots.";musa
1;1;34-36;"And, everywhere I looked, the beast was there
blocking my way, so time and time again
I was about to turn and go back down.";musa
1;1;37-39;"The hour was early in the morning then,
the sun was climbing up with those same stars
that had accompanied it on the world’s first day, the day Divine Love ";musa
1;1;40-42;"set their beauty turning;
so the hour and sweet season of creation
encouraged me to think I could get past";musa
1;1;43-45;"that gaudy beast, wild in its spotted pelt,
but then good hope gave way and fear returned
when the figure of a lion loomed up before me,";musa
1;1;46-48;"and he was coming straight toward me, it seemed,
with head raised high, and furious with hunger
—the air around him seemed to fear his presence.";musa
1;1;49-51;"And now a she-wolf came, that in her leanness
seemed racked with every kind of greediness
(how many people she has brought to grief!).";musa
1;1;52-54;"This last beast brought my spirit down so low
with fear that seized me at the sight of her,
I lost all hope of going up the hill.";musa
1;1;55-57;"As a man who, rejoicing in his gains,
suddenly seeing his gain turn into loss,
will grieve as he compares his then and now,";musa
1;1;58-60;"so she made me do, that relentless beast;
coming toward me, slowly, step by step,
she forced me back to where the sun is mute.";musa
1;1;61-63;"While I was rushing down to that low place,
my eyes made out a figure coming toward me
of one grown faint, perhaps from too much silence.";musa
1;1;64-66;"And when I saw him standing in this wasteland,
“Have pity on my soul,” I cried to him,
“whichever you are, shade or living man!”";musa
1;1;67-69;"“No longer living man, though once I was,”
he said, “and my parents were from Lombardy,
both of them were Mantuans by birth.";musa
1;1;70-72;"I was born, though somewhat late, sub Julio,
and lived in Rome when good Augustus reigned,
when still the false and lying gods were worshipped.";musa
1;1;73-75;"I was a poet and sang of that just man,
son of Anchises, who sailed off from Troy
after the burning of proud Ilium.";musa
1;1;76-78;"But why retreat to so much misery?
Why not climb up this blissful mountain here,
the beginning and the source of all man’s joy?”";musa
1;1;79-81;"“Are you then Virgil, are you then that fount
from which pours forth so rich a stream of words?”
I said to him, bowing my head modestly.";musa
1;1;82-84;"“O light and honor of the other poets,
may my long years of study, and that deep love
that made me search your verses, help me now!";musa
1;1;85-87;"You are my teacher, the first of all my authors,
and you alone the one from whom I took
the noble style that was to bring me honor.";musa
1;1;88-90;"You see the beast that forced me to retreat;
save me from her, I beg you, famous sage,
she makes me tremble, the blood throbs in my veins.”";musa
1;1;91-93;"“But you must journey down another road,”
he answered, when he saw me lost in tears,
“if ever you hope to leave this wilderness;";musa
1;1;94-96;"this beast, the one you cry about in fear,
allows no soul to succeed along her path,
she blocks his way and puts an end to him.";musa
1;1;97-99;"She is by nature so perverse and vicious,
her craving belly is never satisfied,
still hungering for food the more she eats.";musa
1;1;100-102;"She mates with many creatures, and will go on
mating with more until the greyhound comes
and tracks her down to make her die in anguish.";musa
1;1;103-105;"He will not feed on either land or money:
his wisdom, love, and virtue shall sustain him;
he will be born between Feltro and Feltro.";musa
1;1;106-108;"He comes to save that fallen Italy
for which the maid Camilla gave her life
and Turnus, Nisus, Euryalus died of wounds.";musa
1;1;109-111;"And he will hunt for her through every city
until he drives her back to Hell once more,
whence Envy first unleashed her on mankind.";musa
1;1;112-114;"And so, I think it best you follow me
for your own good, and I shall be your guide
and lead you out through an eternal place";musa
1;1;115-117;"where you will hear desperate cries, and see
tormented shades, some old as Hell itself,
and know what second death is, from their screams.";musa
1;1;118-120;"And later you will see those who rejoice
while they are burning, for they have hope of coming,
whenever it may be, to join the blessed—";musa
1;1;121-123;"to whom, if you too wish to make the climb,
a spirit, worthier than I, must take you;
I shall go back, leaving you in her care,";musa
1;1;124-126;"because that Emperor dwelling on high
will not let me lead any to His city,
since I in life rebelled against His law.";musa
1;1;127-129;"Everywhere He reigns, and there He rules;
there is His city, there is His high throne.
Oh, happy the one He makes His citizen!";musa
1;1;130-132;"And I to him: “Poet, I beg of you,
in the name of God, that God you never knew,
save me from this evil place and worse,";musa
1;1;133-135;"lead me there to the place you spoke about
that I may see the gate Saint Peter guards
and those whose anguish you have told me of.”";musa
1;1;136-136;Then he moved on, and I moved close behind him.;musa
1;2;1-3;The day was fading and the darkening air | was releasing all the creatures on our earth | from their daily tasks, and I, one man alone,;musa
1;2;4-6;was making ready to endure the battle | of the journey, and of the pity it involved, | which my memory, unerring, shall now retrace.;musa
1;2;7-9;O Muses! O high genius! Help me now! | O memory that wrote down what I saw, | here your true excellence shall be revealed!;musa
1;2;10-12;Then I began: “O poet come to guide me, | tell me if you think my worth sufficient | before you trust me to this arduous road.;musa
1;2;13-15;"You wrote about young Sylvius’s father, | who went beyond, with flesh corruptible, | with all his senses, to the immortal realm;";musa
1;2;16-18;but if the Adversary of all evil | was kind to him, considering who he was, | and the consequence that was to come from him,;musa
1;2;19-21;this cannot seem, to thoughtful men, unfitting, | for in the highest heaven he was chosen | father of glorious Rome and of her empire,;musa
1;2;22-24;and both the city and her lands, in truth, | were established as the place of holiness | where the successors of great Peter sit.;musa
1;2;25-27;"And from this journey you celebrate in verse, | Aeneas learned those things that were to bring | victory for him, and for Rome, the Papal seat;";musa
1;2;28-30;then later the Chosen Vessel, Paul, ascended | to bring back confirmation of that faith | which is the first step on salvation’s road.;musa
1;2;31-33;"But why am I to go? Who allows me to? | I am not Aeneas, I am not Paul, | neither I nor any man would think me worthy;";musa
1;2;34-36;and so, if I should undertake the journey, | I fear it might turn out an act of folly— | you are wise, you see more than my words express.”;musa
1;2;37-39;As one who unwills what he willed, will change | his purpose with some new second thought, | completely quitting what he first had started,;musa
1;2;40-42;so I did, standing there on that dark slope, | thinking, ending the beginning of that venture | I was so quick to take up at the start.;musa
1;2;43-45;“If I have truly understood your words,” | that shade of magnanimity replied, | “your soul is burdened with that cowardice;musa
1;2;46-48;which often weighs so heavily on man, | it turns him from a noble enterprise | like a frightened beast that shies at its own shadow.;musa
1;2;49-51;To free you from this fear, let me explain | the reason I came here, the words I heard | that first time I felt pity for your soul:;musa
1;2;52-54;I was among those dead who are suspended, | when a lady summoned me. She was so blessed | and beautiful, I implored her to command me.;musa
1;2;55-57;With eyes of light more bright than any star, | in low, soft tones she started to address me | in her own language, with an angel’s voice:;musa
1;2;58-60;‘O noble soul, courteous Mantuan, | whose fame the world continues to preserve | and will preserve as long as world there is,;musa
1;2;61-63;"my friend, who is no friend of Fortune’s, strays | on a desert slope; so many obstacles | have crossed his path, his fright has turned him back.";musa
1;2;64-66;I fear he may have gone so far astray, | from what report has come to me in Heaven, | that I may have started to his aid too late.;musa
1;2;67-69;Now go, and with your elegance of speech, | with whatever may be needed for his freedom, | give him your help, and thereby bring me solace.;musa
1;2;70-72;"I am Beatrice, who urges you to go; | I come from the place I am longing to return to; | love moved me, as it moves me now to speak.";musa
1;2;73-75;When I return to stand before my Lord, | often I shall sing your praises to Him.’ | And then she spoke no more. And I began,;musa
1;2;76-78;‘O Lady of Grace, through whom alone mankind | may go beyond all worldly things contained | within the sphere that makes the smallest round,;musa
1;2;79-81;your plea fills me with happy eagerness— | to have obeyed already would still seem late! | You needed only to express your wish.;musa
1;2;82-84;But tell me how you dared to make this journey | all the way down to this point of spacelessness, | away from your spacious home that calls you back.’;musa
1;2;85-87;‘Because your question searches for deep meaning, | I shall explain in simple words,’ she said, | ‘just why I have no fear of coming here.;musa
1;2;88-90;A man must stand in fear of just those things | that truly have the power to do us harm, | of nothing else, for nothing else is fearsome.;musa
1;2;91-93;God gave me such a nature through His Grace, | the torments you must bear cannot affect me, | nor are the fires of Hell a threat to me.;musa
1;2;94-96;A gracious lady sits in Heaven grieving | for what happened to the one I send you to, | and her compassion breaks Heaven’s stern decree.;musa
1;2;97-99;She called Lucia and making her request, | she said, “Your faithful one is now in need | of you, and to you I now commend his soul.”;musa
1;2;100-102;Lucia, the enemy of cruelty, | hastened to make her way to where I was, | sitting by the side of ancient Rachel,;musa
1;2;103-105;and said to me: “Beatrice, God’s true praise, | will you not help the one whose love was such | it made him leave the vulgar crowd for you?;musa
1;2;106-108;Do you not hear the pity of his weeping, | do you not see what death it is that threatens him | along that river the sea shall never conquer?”;musa
1;2;109-111;There never was a worldly person living | more anxious to promote his selfish gains | than I was at the sound of words like these—;musa
1;2;112-114;to leave my holy seat and come down here | and place my trust in you, in your noble speech | that honors you and all those who have heard it!’;musa
1;2;115-117;When she had finished reasoning, she turned | her shining eyes away, and there were tears. | How eager then I was to come to you!;musa
1;2;118-120;And I have come to you just as she wished, | and I have freed you from the beast that stood | blocking the quick way up the mount of bliss.;musa
1;2;121-123;So what is wrong? Why, why do you delay? | Why are you such a coward in your heart, | why aren’t you bold and free of all your fear,;musa
1;2;124-126;when three such gracious ladies, who are blessed, | watch out for you up there in Heaven’s court, | and my words, too, bring promise of such good?”;musa
1;2;127-129;As little flowers from the frosty night | are closed and limp, and when the sun shines down | on them, they rise to open on their stem,;musa
1;2;130-132;my wilted strength began to bloom within me, | and such warm courage flowed into my heart | that I spoke like a man set free of fear.;musa
1;2;133-135;“O she, compassionate, who moved to help me! | And you, all kindness, in obeying quick | those words of truth she brought with her for you—;musa
1;2;136-138;you and the words you spoke have moved my heart | with such desire to continue onward | that now I have returned to my first purpose.;musa
1;2;139-141;Let us start, for both our wills, joined now, are one. | You are my guide, you are my lord and teacher.” | These were my words to him and, when he moved,;musa
1;2;142-142;I entered on that deep and rugged road.;musa
1;3;1-3;I am the way into the doleful city, I am the way into eternal grief, I am the way to a forsaken race.;musa
1;3;4-6;"Justice it was that moved my great Creator; Divine Omnipotence created me, and Highest Wisdom joined with Primal Love.";musa
1;3;7-9;Before me nothing but eternal things were made, and I shall last eternally. Abandon every hope, all you who enter.;musa
1;3;10-12;"I saw these words spelled out in somber colors inscribed along the ledge above a gate; “Master,” I said, “these words I see are cruel.”";musa
1;3;13-15;" He answered me, speaking with experience: “Now here you must leave all distrust behind; let all your cowardice die on this spot.";musa
1;3;16-18;We are at the place where earlier I said you could expect to see the suffering race of souls who lost the good of intellect.”;musa
1;3;19-21; Placing his hand on mine, smiling at me in such a way that I was reassured, he led me in, into those mysteries.;musa
1;3;22-24;Here sighs and cries and shrieks of lamentation echoed throughout the starless air of Hell  at first these sounds resounding made me weep:;musa
1;3;25-27; tongues confused, a language strained in anguish with cadences of anger, shrill outcries and raucous groans that joined with sounds of hands.;musa
1;3;28-30;Raising a whirling storm that turns itself forever through that air of endless black, like grains of sand swirling when a whirlwind blows. ;musa
1;3;31-33;And I, in the midst of all this circling horror, began, “Teacher, what are these sounds I hear? What souls are these so overwhelmed by grief?”;musa
1;3;34-36;And he to me: “This wretched state of being is the fate of those sad souls who lived a life but lived it with no blame and with no praise. ;musa
1;3;37-39;They are mixed with that repulsive choir of angels neither faithful nor unfaithful to their God, who undecided stood but for themselves.;musa
1;3;40-42;Heaven, to keep its beauty, cast them out, but even Hell itself would not receive them, for fear the damned might glory over them.”;musa
1;3;43-45; And I. “Master, what torments do they suffer that force them to lament so bitterly?” He answered: “I will tell you in few words:;musa
1;3;46-48;These wretches have no hope of truly dying, and this blind life they lead is so abject it makes them envy every other fate. ;musa
1;3;49-51;The world will not record their having been there  Heaven’s mercy and its justice turn from them. Let’s not discuss them  look and pass them by.”;musa
1;3;52-54;"And so I looked and saw a kind of banner rushing ahead, whirling with aimless speed as though it would not ever take a stand; ";musa
1;3;55-57;behind it an interminable train of souls pressed on, so many that I wondered how death could have undone so great a number.;musa
1;3;58-60;When I had recognized a few of them, I saw the shade of the one who must have been the coward who had made the great refusal. ;musa
1;3;61-63;At once I understood, and I was sure this was that sect of evil souls who were hateful to God and to His enemies.;musa
1;3;64-66;These wretches, who had never truly lived, went naked, and were stung and stung again by the hornets and the wasps that circled them ;musa
1;3;67-69;"and made their faces run with blood in streaks; their blood, mixed with their tears, dripped to their feet, and disgusting maggots collected in the pus.";musa
1;3;70-72;And when I looked beyond this crowd I saw a throng upon the shore of a wide river, which made me ask, “Master, I would like to know:;musa
1;3;73-75; who are these people, and what law is this that makes those souls so eager for the crossing—as I can see, even in this dim light?”;musa
1;3;76-78;And he: “All this will be made plain to you as soon as we shall come to stop awhile upon the sorrowful shore of Acheron.”;musa
1;3;79-81; And I, with eyes cast down in shame, for fear that I perhaps had spoken out of turn, said nothing more until we reached the river.;musa
1;3;82-84;And suddenly, coming toward us in a boat, a man of years whose ancient hair was white shouted at us, “Woe to you, perverted souls!;musa
1;3;85-87; Give up all hope of ever seeing Heaven: I come to lead you to the other shore, into eternal darkness, ice, and fire.;musa
1;3;88-90;And you, the living soul, you over there, get away from all these people who are dead.” But when he saw I did not move aside, ;musa
1;3;91-93;"he said, “Another way, by other ports, not here, shall you pass to reach the other shore; a lighter skiff than this must carry you.”";musa
1;3;94-96;"And my guide, “Charon, this is no time for anger! It is so willed, there where the power is for what is willed; that’s all you need to know.”";musa
1;3;97-99; These words brought silence to the woolly cheeks of the ancient steersman of the livid marsh, whose eyes were set in glowing wheels of fire.;musa
1;3;100-102;But all those souls there, naked, in despair, changed color and their teeth began to chatter at the sound of his announcement of their doom. ;musa
1;3;103-105;They were cursing God, cursing their own parents, the human race, the time, the place, the seed of their beginning, and their day of birth.;musa
1;3;106-108;Then all together, weeping bitterly, they packed themselves along the wicked shore that waits for every man who fears not God.;musa
1;3;109-111; The devil, Charon, with eyes of glowing coals, summons them all together with a signal, and with an oar he strikes the laggard sinner.;musa
1;3;112-114;As in autumn when the leaves begin to fall, one after the other (until the branch is witness to the spoils spread on the ground), ;musa
1;3;115-117;so did the evil seed of Adam’s Fall drop from that shore to the boat, one at a time, at the signal, like the falcon to its lure.;musa
1;3;118-120;Away they go across the darkened waters, and before they reach the other side to land, a new throng starts collecting on this side.;musa
1;3;121-123;" “My son,” the gentle master said to me, “all those who perish in the wrath of God assemble here from all parts of the earth;";musa
1;3;124-126;"they want to cross the river, they are eager; it is Divine Justice that spurs them on, turning the fear they have into desire.";musa
1;3;127-129; A good soul never comes to make this crossing, so, if Charon grumbles at the sight of you, you see now what his words are really saying.”;musa
1;3;130-132;"He finished speaking, and the grim terrain shook violently; and the fright it gave me even now in recollection makes me sweat.";musa
1;3;133-135; Out of the tear-drenched land a wind arose which blasted forth into a reddish light, knocking my senses out of me completely, ;musa
1;3;136-136;and I fell as one falls tired into sleep.;musa
1;4;1-3;A heavy clap of thunder! I awoke from the deep sleep that drugged my mind—startled, the way one is when shaken out of sleep.;musa
1;4;4-6; I turned my rested eyes from side to side, already on my feet and, staring hard, I tried my best to find out where I was,;musa
1;4;7-9; and this is what I saw: I found myself upon the brink of grief’s abysmal valley that collects the thunderings of endless cries. ;musa
1;4;10-12;So dark and deep and nebulous it was, try as I might to force my sight below, I could not see the shape of anything.;musa
1;4;13-15; “Let us descend into the sightless world,” began the poet (his face was deathly pale): “I will go first, and you will follow me.” ;musa
1;4;16-18; And I, aware of his changed color, said: “But how can I go on if you are frightened? You are my constant strength when I lose heart.” ;musa
1;4;19-21;And he to me: “The anguish of the souls that are down here paints my face with pity — which you have wrongly taken to be fear.;musa
1;4;22-24; Let us go, the long road urges us.” He entered then, leading the way for me down to the first circle of the abyss.;musa
1;4;25-27; Down there, to judge only by what I heard, there were no wails but just the sounds of sighs rising and trembling through the timeless air, ;musa
1;4;28-30;the sounds of sighs of untormented grief burdening these groups, diverse and teeming, made up of men and women and of infants.;musa
1;4;31-33; Then the good master said, “You do not ask what sort of souls are these you see around you. Now you should know before we go on farther, ;musa
1;4;34-36; they have not sinned. But their great worth alone was not enough, for they did not know Baptism, which is the gateway to the faith you follow, ;musa
1;4;37-39;"and if they came before the birth of Christ, they did not worship God the way one should; I myself am a member of this group.";musa
1;4;40-42; For this defect, and for no other guilt, we here are lost. In this alone we suffer: cut off from hope, we live on in desire.”;musa
1;4;43-45;" The words I heard weighed heavy on my heart; to think that souls as virtuous as these were suspended in that limbo, and forever! ";musa
1;4;46-48;“Tell me, my teacher, tell me, O my master,” I began (wishing to have confirmed by him the teachings of unerring Christian doctrine),;musa
1;4;49-51; “did any ever leave here, through his merit or with another’s help, and go to bliss?” And he, who understood my hidden question, ;musa
1;4;52-54; answered: “I was a novice in this place when I saw a mighty lord descend to us who wore the sign of victory as his crown. ;musa
1;4;55-57;"He took from us the shade of our first parent, of Abel, his good son, of Noah, too, and of obedient Moses, who made the laws;";musa
1;4;58-60;" Abram, the Patriarch, David the King, Israel with his father and his children, with Rachel, whom he worked so hard to win; ";musa
1;4;61-63;"and many more he chose for blessedness; and you should know, before these souls were taken, no human soul had ever reached salvation.” ";musa
1;4;64-66;We did not stop our journey while he spoke, but continued on our way along the woods — I say the woods, for souls were thick as trees.;musa
1;4;67-69; We had not gone too far from where I woke when I made out a fire up ahead, a hemisphere of light that lit the dark.  ;musa
1;4;70-72;We were still at some distance from that place, but close enough for me vaguely to see that honorable souls possessed that spot. ;musa
1;4;73-75;“O glory of the sciences and arts, who are these souls enjoying special honor, dwelling apart from all the others here?”;musa
1;4;76-78; And he to me: “The honored name they bear that still resounds above in your own world wins Heaven’s favor for them in this place.”;musa
1;4;79-81; And as he spoke I heard a voice announce: “Now let us honor our illustrious poet, his shade that left is now returned to us.” ;musa
1;4;82-84;And when the voice was silent and all was quiet I saw four mighty shades approaching us, their faces showing neither joy nor sorrow.;musa
1;4;85-87; Then my good master started to explain: “Observe the one who comes with sword in hand, leading the three as if he were their master. ;musa
1;4;88-90;" It is the shade of Homer, sovereign poet, and coming second, Horace, the satirist; Ovid is the third, and last comes Lucan. 
";musa
1;4;91-93;Since they all share one name with me, the name you heard resounding in that single voice, they honor me and do well doing so.”;musa
1;4;94-96; So I saw gathered there the noble school of the master singer of sublimest verse, who soars above all others like the eagle.;musa
1;4;97-99; And after they had talked awhile together, they turned and with a gesture welcomed me, and at that sign I saw my master smile. ;musa
1;4;100-102;Greater honor still they deigned to grant me: they welcomed me as one of their own group, so that I numbered sixth among such minds.;musa
1;4;103-105; We walked together toward the shining light, discussing things that here are best kept silent, as there they were most fitting for discussion. ;musa
1;4;106-108; We reached the boundaries of a splendid castle that seven times was circled by high walls defended by a sweetly flowing stream. ;musa
1;4;109-111;"We walked right over it as on hard ground; through seven gates I passed with those wise spirits, and then we reached a meadow fresh in bloom.";musa
1;4;112-114;" There people were whose eyes were calm and grave, whose bearing told of great authority; seldom they spoke and always quietly. ";musa
1;4;115-117; Then moving to one side we reached a place spread out and luminous, higher than before, allowing us to view all who were there.;musa
1;4;118-120;And right before us on the lustrous green the mighty shades were pointed out to me (my heart felt glory when I looked at them).;musa
1;4;121-123;There was Electra standing with a group, among whom I saw Hector and Aeneas, and Caesar, falcon-eyed and fully armed.;musa
1;4;124-126;"I saw Camilla and Penthesilea; across the way I saw the Latian King, with Lavinia, his daughter, by his side.";musa
1;4;127-129;"I saw the Brutus who drove out the Tarquin; Lucretia, Julia, Marcia, and Cornelia; off, by himself, I noticed Saladin,";musa
1;4;130-132;and when I raised my eyes a little higher I saw the master sage of those who know, sitting with his philosophic family.;musa
1;4;133-135;"All gaze at him, all pay their homage to him; and there I saw both Socrates and Plato, each closer to his side than any other;";musa
1;4;136-138;"Democritus, who said the world was chance, Diogenes, Thales, Anaxagoras, Empedocles, Zeno, and Heraclitus;";musa
1;4;139-141;I saw the one who classified our herbs: Dioscorides I mean. And I saw Orpheus, Tully, Linus, Seneca the moralist.;musa
1;4;142-144;Euclid the geometer, and Ptolemy, Hippocrates, Galen, Avicenna, and Averroes, who made the Commentary.;musa
1;4;145-147;"I cannot tell about them all in full; my theme is long and urges me ahead, often I must omit things I have seen.";musa
1;4;148-150;"The company of six becomes just two; my wise guide leads me by another way out of the quiet into tempestuous air.";musa
1;4;151-151;I come into a place where no light is.;musa
1;5;1-3;This way I went, descending from the first into the second round, that holds less space but much more pain—stinging the soul to wailing.;musa
1;5;4-6;"There stands Minos grotesquely, and he snarls, examining the guilty at the entrance; he judges and dispatches, tail in coils.";musa
1;5;7-9;By this I mean that when the evil soul appears before him, it confesses all, and he, who is the expert judge of sins,;musa
1;5;10-12;"knows to what place in Hell the soul belongs; the times he wraps his tail around himself tell just how far the sinner must go down.";musa
1;5;13-15;"The damned keep crowding up in front of him: they pass along to judgment one by one; they speak, they hear, and then are hurled below.";musa
1;5;16-18;“O you who come to the place where pain is host,” Minos spoke out when he caught sight of me, putting aside the duties of his office,;musa
1;5;19-21;“be careful how you enter and whom you trust, it’s easy to get in, but don’t be fooled!” And my guide said to him: “Why keep on shouting?;musa
1;5;22-24;"Do not attempt to stop his fated journey; it is so willed there where the power is for what is willed; that’s all you need to know.”";musa
1;5;25-27;"And now the notes of anguish start to play upon my ears; and now I find myself where sounds on sounds of weeping pound at me.";musa
1;5;28-30;I came to a place where no light shone at all, bellowing like the sea racked by a tempest, when warring winds attack it from both sides.;musa
1;5;31-33;The infernal storm, eternal in its rage, sweeps and drives the spirits with its blast: it whirls them, lashing them with punishment.;musa
1;5;34-36;"When they are swept back past their place of judgment, then come the shrieks, laments, and anguished cries; there they blaspheme God’s almighty power.";musa
1;5;37-39;"I learned that to this place of punishment all those who sin in lust have been condemned, those who make reason slave to appetite;";musa
1;5;40-42;and as the wings of starlings in the winter bear them along in wide-spread, crowded flocks, so does that wind propel the evil spirits:;musa
1;5;43-45;now here, then there, and up and down, it drives them with never any hope to comfort them—hope not of rest but even of suffering less.;musa
1;5;46-48;And just like cranes in flight, chanting their lays, stretching an endless line in their formation, I saw approaching, crying their laments,;musa
1;5;49-51;spirits carried along by the battling winds. And so I asked, “Teacher, tell me, what souls are these punished in the sweep of the black wind?”;musa
1;5;52-54;"“The first of those whose story you should know,” my master wasted no time answering, “was empress over lands of many tongues;";musa
1;5;55-57;"her vicious tastes had so corrupted her she licensed every form of lust with laws to cleanse the stain of scandal she had spread;";musa
1;5;58-60;"she is Semiramis, who, legend says, was Ninus’ wife as well as his successor; she governed all the land the Sultan rules.";musa
1;5;61-63;"The next is she who killed herself for love and broke faith with the ashes of Sichaeus; and there is Cleopatra, who loved men’s lusting.";musa
1;5;64-66;"See Helen there, the root of evil woe lasting long years, and see the great Achilles, who lost his life to love, in final combat;";musa
1;5;67-69;see Paris, Tristan”—then, more than a thousand he pointed out to me, and named them all, those shades whom love cut off from life on earth.;musa
1;5;70-72;After I heard my teacher call the names of all these knights and ladies of ancient times, pity confused my senses, and I was dazed.;musa
1;5;73-75;I began: “Poet, I would like, with all my heart, to speak to those two there who move together and seem to be so light upon the winds.”;musa
1;5;76-78;"And he: “You’ll see when they are closer to us; if you entreat them by that love of theirs that carries them along, they’ll come to you.”";musa
1;5;79-81;When the winds bent their course in our direction I raised my voice to them, “O wearied souls, come speak with us if it be not forbidden.”;musa
1;5;82-84;As doves, called by desire to return to their sweet nest, with wings raised high and poised, float downward through the air, guided by will,;musa
1;5;85-87;so these two left the flock where Dido is and came toward us through the malignant air, such was the tender power of my call.;musa
1;5;88-90;“O living creature, gracious and so kind, who makes your way here through this dingy air to visit us who stained the world with blood,;musa
1;5;91-93;if we could claim as friend the King of Kings, we would beseech him that he grant you peace, you who show pity for our atrocious plight.;musa
1;5;94-96;Whatever pleases you to hear or speak we will hear and we will speak about with you as long as the wind, here where we are, is silent.;musa
1;5;97-99;The place where I was born lies on the shore where the river Po with its attendant streams descends to seek its final resting place.;musa
1;5;100-102;Love, quick to kindle in the gentle heart, seized this one for the beauty of my body, torn from me. (How it happened still offends me!);musa
1;5;103-105;Love, that excuses no one loved from loving, seized me so strongly with delight in him that, as you see, he never leaves my side.;musa
1;5;106-108;Love led us straight to sudden death together. Caina awaits the one who quenched our lives.” These were the words that came from them to us.;musa
1;5;109-111;When those offended souls had told their story, I bowed my head and kept it bowed until the poet said, “What are you thinking of?”;musa
1;5;112-114;When finally I spoke, I sighed, “Alas, all those sweet thoughts, and oh, how much desiring brought these two down into this agony.”;musa
1;5;115-117;"And then I turned to them and tried to speak; I said, “Francesca, the torment that you suffer brings painful tears of pity to my eyes.";musa
1;5;118-120;But tell me, in that time of your sweet sighing how, and by what signs, did love allow you to recognize your dubious desires?”;musa
1;5;121-123;And she to me: “There is no greater pain than to remember, in our present grief, past happiness (as well your teacher knows)!;musa
1;5;124-126;But if your great desire is to learn the very root of such a love as ours, I shall tell you, but in words of flowing tears.;musa
1;5;127-129;"One day we read, to pass the time away, of Lancelot, of how he fell in love; we were alone, innocent of suspicion.";musa
1;5;130-132;"Time and again our eyes were brought together by the book we read; our faces flushed and paled. To the moment of one line alone we yielded:";musa
1;5;133-135;it was when we read about those longed-for lips now being kissed by such a famous lover, that this one (who shall never leave my side);musa
1;5;136-138;then kissed my mouth, and trembled as he did. Our Galehot was that book and he who wrote it. That day we read no further.”;musa
1;5;139-141;"And all the while the one of the two spirits spoke these words, the other wept, in such a way that pity blurred my senses;";musa
1;5;142-142;I swooned as though to die and fell to Hell’s floor as a body, dead, falls.;musa
1;6;1-3;At the return of consciousness, that closed before the pity of those two relations, which utterly with sadness had confused me.;musa
1;6;4-6;New torments I behold, and new tormented around me, whichever way I move, and whichever way I turn and gaze.;musa
1;6;7-9;"In the third circle am I, of the rain eternal, accursed, cold, and heavy; its law and quality are never new.";musa
1;6;10-12;Huge hail, and water dark and murky, and snow pour down through the tenebrous air in torrents. The earth that receives this is noisome. ;musa
1;6;13-15;Cerberus, monster cruel and strange, with his three throats, barks dog-like. Over the people who are here submerged,;musa
1;6;16-18; his eyes are red, his beard is black and greasy, his belly large, his hands are clawed. He rends the spirits, flays, and quarters them. ;musa
1;6;19-21;"The rain makes them howl like dogs; they shield themselves with one side. From the other, turning often in their miserable torment. ";musa
1;6;22-24;"When Cerberus, the great worm, perceived us, he opened his mouths and displayed his fangs; not a limb had he that was motionless.";musa
1;6;25-27;And my guide, stretching out his hands, took of the earth, and with full fists, he threw it into those ravenous gullets. ;musa
1;6;28-30;As a dog that barks and fiercely craves, but calms itself once it snatches its food, fighting and struggling only to devour it,;musa
1;6;31-33;So did those filthy demon faces turn, the faces of Cerberus, who thunders so, that the souls would wish they could be deaf. ;musa
1;6;34-36;We passed across the shades, whom the heavy rain subdues, placing our feet upon their emptiness, which seemed solid forms.;musa
1;6;37-39;All lay sprawled upon the ground, except for one, who quickly rose to sit, as soon as he saw us passing by. ;musa
1;6;40-42;"“O you that are led through this Hell,” he said to me, “recognize me if you can; you were made before I was unmade.”";musa
1;6;43-45;And I to him: “The anguish you endure may well have taken you from my memory, so that I do not recall having seen you.;musa
1;6;46-48;But tell me who you are, placed in such a sorrowful and woeful spot, where, if any is worse, none is more loathsome.”;musa
1;6;49-51;And he to me: “Your city, which is so full of envy that its sack already overflows, held me in it during my bright life. ;musa
1;6;52-54;"You citizens called me Ciacco; for the ruinous sin of gluttony, as you see, I am broken by this rain.";musa
1;6;55-57;And I, in my misery, am not alone, for all these suffer the same penalty for the same fault.” And he said no more.;musa
1;6;58-60; I answered him: “Ciacco, your suffering weighs upon me so that it moves me to tears. But tell me, if you know, what will become;musa
1;6;61-63; of the citizens of the divided city? Is there any just man among them? And tell me the cause of so much discord.”;musa
1;6;64-66;And he to me: “After long contention, they will come to bloodshed, And the rustic party will drive the other out with much offense.;musa
1;6;67-69;Then, within three years, this one must fall, and the other shall rise in victory, by force of him who now is on the coast.;musa
1;6;70-72;High will it hold its head for a long time, keeping the other under heavy burdens, however it weeps or feels the shame. ;musa
1;6;73-75;"Two men are just, but they are not heeded there; pride, envy, and greed are the three sparks that have set their hearts aflame.”";musa
1;6;76-78;Here he ended his grievous words. And I to him: “I still would learn more, and have you grant me further speech.;musa
1;6;79-81; Farinata and Tegghiaio, who were so worthy, Jacopo Rusticucci, Arrigo, and Mosca, And the others who pursued the good,;musa
1;6;82-84; tell me where they are, and let me know, for I am eager to understand whether Heaven soothes or Hell torments them.”;musa
1;6;85-87;"And he: “They are among the darkest souls, dragged down by different faults; If you descend that far, you may see them.";musa
1;6;88-90;But when you return to the sweet world, I pray you to recall me among men. I tell you no more and answer no more.”;musa
1;6;91-93;Then he turned his straight eyes askew, looked at me a moment, Then bowed his head and fell down with the others, blind as they.;musa
1;6;94-96;And my leader said to me: “He wakes no more until the angel’s trumpet sounds, and the mighty foe arrives.;musa
1;6;97-99;Then each shall find again his mournful tomb, shall take his flesh and form once more, and hear the sound that echoes for eternity.”;musa
1;6;100-102;Thus we went on through the filthy mixture of shades and rain, with slow, heavy steps, Speaking lightly of things to come.;musa
1;6;103-105; So I said: “Master, will these torments increase after the Last Judgment, or will they be less, or just the same?”;musa
1;6;106-108;And he to me: “Return to your learning, which tells you that the more perfect a thing, The more it feels both pleasure and pain.;musa
1;6;109-111;Although these damned shall never reach true perfection, yet they look to be nearer it then than now.”;musa
1;6;112-114;We went round along that road, speaking much more than I now recount, Until we reached the place where the descent is.;musa
1;6;115-115;There we found Plutus, the great enemy.;musa
1;7;1-3;"""Pape Satàn, pape Satàn, Aleppe!"" Thus Plutus with his clucking voice began; and that benignant Sage, who all things knew, ";musa
1;7;4-6;"said, to encourage me: ""Let not thy fear Harm thee; for any power that he may have shall not prevent thy going down this crag."" ";musa
1;7;7-9;"Then he turned round unto that bloated lip, and said: ""Be silent, thou accursed wolf; Consume within thyself with thine own rage. ";musa
1;7;10-12;"Not causeless is this journey to the abyss; thus is it willed on high, where Michael wrought vengeance upon the proud adultery.""";musa
1;7;13-15;Even as the sails inflated by the wind together fall involved when snaps the mast, so fell the cruel monster to the earth.;musa
1;7;16-18;Thus we descended into the fourth chasm, gaining still farther on the dolesome shore which all the woe of the universe insacks.;musa
1;7;19-21;Justice of God, ah! who heaps up so many new toils and sufferings as I beheld? And why doth our transgression waste us so?;musa
1;7;22-24;As doth the billow there upon Charybdis, that breaks itself on that which it encounters, so here the folk must dance their roundelay.;musa
1;7;25-27;Here saw I people, more than elsewhere, many, on one side and the other, with great howls, rolling weights forward by main-force of chest.;musa
1;7;28-30;"They clashed together, and then at that point each one turned backward, rolling retrograde, crying, ""Why keepest?"" and, ""Why squanderest thou?""";musa
1;7;31-33;Thus they returned along the lurid circle on either hand unto the opposite point, shouting their shameful metre evermore.;musa
1;7;34-36;"Then each, when he arrived there, wheeled about through his half-circle to another joust; and I, who had my heart pierced as it were,";musa
1;7;37-39;"Exclaimed: ""My Master, now declare to me what people these are, and if all were clerks, these shaven crowns upon the left of us.""";musa
1;7;40-42;"And he to me: ""All of them were asquint in intellect in the first life, so much that there with measure they no spending made.";musa
1;7;43-45;Clearly enough their voices bark it forth, whene’er they reach the two points of the circle, where sunders them the opposite defect.;musa
1;7;46-48;"Clerks those were who no hairy covering have on the head, and Popes and Cardinals, in whom doth avarice practise its excess.""";musa
1;7;49-51;"And I: ""My Master, among such as these I ought forsooth to recognize some few, who were infected with these maladies.""";musa
1;7;52-54;"And he to me: ""Vain thought thou entertainest; the undiscerning life which made them sordid now makes them unto all discernment dim.";musa
1;7;55-57;"Forever shall they come to these two buttings; these from the sepulchre shall rise again with the fist closed, and these with tresses shorn.";musa
1;7;58-60;"Ill giving and ill keeping the fair world have ta’en from them, and placed them in this scuffle; whate’er it be, no words adorn I for it.";musa
1;7;61-63;Now canst thou, Son, behold the transient farce of goods that are committed unto Fortune, for which the human race each other buffet.;musa
1;7;64-66;"For all the gold that is beneath the moon, or ever has been, of these weary souls could never make a single one repose.""";musa
1;7;67-69;"""Master,"" I said to him, ""now tell me also what is this Fortune which thou speakest of, that has the world's goods so within its clutches?""";musa
1;7;70-72;"And he to me: ""O creatures imbecile, what ignorance is this which doth beset you? Now will I have thee learn my judgment of her.";musa
1;7;73-75;He whose omniscience everything transcends the heavens created, and gave who should guide them, that every part to every part may shine.;musa
1;7;76-78;"Distributing the light in equal measure; he in like manner to the mundane splendors ordained a general ministress and guide,";musa
1;7;79-81;That she might change at times the empty treasures from race to race, from one blood to another, beyond resistance of all human wisdom.;musa
1;7;82-84;Therefore one people triumphs, and another languishes, in pursuance of her judgment, which hidden is, as in the grass a serpent.;musa
1;7;85-87;"Your knowledge has no counterstand against her; she makes provision, judges, and pursues her governance, as theirs the other gods.";musa
1;7;88-90;"Her permutations have not any truce; necessity makes her precipitate, so often cometh who his turn obtains.";musa
1;7;91-93;And this is she who is so crucified even by those who ought to give her praise, giving her blame amiss, and bad repute.;musa
1;7;94-96;"But she is blissful, and she hears it not; among the other primal creatures gladsome she turns her sphere, and blissful she rejoices.";musa
1;7;97-99;"Let us descend now unto greater woe; already sinks each star that was ascending when I set out, and loitering is forbidden.""";musa
1;7;100-102;We crossed the circle to the other bank, near to a fount that boils, and pours itself along a gully that runs out of it.;musa
1;7;103-105;"The water was more sombre far than perse; and we, in company with the dusky waves, made entrance downward by a path uncouth.";musa
1;7;106-108;A marsh it makes, which has the name of Styx, this tristful brooklet, when it has descended down to the foot of the malign gray shores.;musa
1;7;109-111;And I, who stood intent upon beholding, saw people mud-besprent in that lagoon, all of them naked and with angry look.;musa
1;7;112-114;They smote each other not alone with hands, but with the head and with the breast and feet, tearing each other piecemeal with their teeth.;musa
1;7;115-117;"Said the good Master: ""Son, thou now beholdest the souls of those whom anger overcame; and likewise I would have thee know for certain.";musa
1;7;118-120;Beneath the water people are who sigh and make this water bubble at the surface, as the eye tells thee wheresoe’er it turns.;musa
1;7;121-123;"Fixed in the mire they say, ‘We sullen were in the sweet air, which by the sun is gladdened, bearing within ourselves the sluggish reek;";musa
1;7;124-126;"Now we are sullen in this sable mire.’ This hymn do they keep gurgling in their throats, for with unbroken words they cannot say it.""";musa
1;7;127-129;Thus we went circling round the filthy fen a great arc ’twixt the dry bank and the swamp, with eyes turned unto those who gorge the mire.;musa
1;7;130-130;Unto the foot of a tower we came at last.;musa
1;8;1-3;I say, continuing, that long before | We to the foot of that high tower had come, | Our eyes went upward to the summit of it,;musa
1;8;4-6;By reason of two flamelets we saw placed there, | And from afar another answered them, | So far, that hardly could the eye attain it.;musa
1;8;7-9;And, to the sea of all discernment turned, | I said: “What sayeth this, and what respondeth | That other fire? And who are they that made it?”;musa
1;8;10-12;And he to me: “Across the turbid waves | What is expected thou canst now discern, | If reek of the morass conceal it not.”;musa
1;8;13-15;Cord never shot an arrow from itself | That sped away athwart the air so swift, | As I beheld a very little boat;musa
1;8;16-18;Come o’er the water toward us at that moment, | Under the guidance of a single pilot | Who shouted, “Now art thou arrived, fell soul?”;musa
1;8;19-21;"“Phlegyas, Phlegyas,” thou criest out in vain | For this once,” said my Lord; “thou shalt not have us | Longer than in the passing of the slough.”";musa
1;8;22-24;As he who listens to some great deceit | That has been done to him, and then resents it, | Such became Phlegyas, in his gathered wrath.;musa
1;8;25-27;My Guide descended down into the boat, | And then he made me enter after him, | And only when I entered seemed it laden.;musa
1;8;28-30;Soon as the Guide and I were in the boat, | The antique prow goes on its way, dividing | More of the water than ’tis wont with others.;musa
1;8;31-33;While we were running through the dead canal, | Uprose in front of me one full of mire, | And said, “Who art thou that comest ere the hour?”;musa
1;8;34-36;"And I to him: “Although I come, I stay not; | But who art thou that hast become so squalid?” | “Thou seest that I am one who weeps,” he answered.";musa
1;8;37-39;"And I to him: “With weeping and with wailing, | Thou spirit maledict, do thou remain; | For thee I know, though thou art all defiled.”";musa
1;8;40-42;"Then stretched he both his hands unto the boat; | Whereat my wary Master thrust him back, | Saying, “Away there with the other dogs!”";musa
1;8;43-45;"Thereafter with his arms he clasped my neck; | He kissed my face, and said: “Disdainful soul, | Blessed be she who bore thee in her bosom.";musa
1;8;46-48;"That was an arrogant person in the world; | Goodness is none, that decks his memory; | So likewise here his shade is furious.";musa
1;8;49-51;How many are esteemed great kings up there, | Who here shall be like unto swine in mire, | Leaving behind them horrible dispraises!“;musa
1;8;52-54;And I: “My Master, much should I be pleased, | If I could see him soused into this broth, | Before we issue forth out of the lake.”;musa
1;8;55-57;"And he to me: “Ere unto thee the shore | Reveal itself, thou shalt be satisfied; | Such a desire ‘tis meet thou shouldst enjoy.”";musa
1;8;58-60;A little after that, I saw such havoc | Made of him by the people of the mire, | That still I praise and thank my God for it.;musa
1;8;61-63;They all were shouting, “At Filippo Argenti!” | And that exasperate spirit Florentine | Turned round upon himself with his own teeth.;musa
1;8;64-66;"We left him there, and more of him I tell not; | But on mine ears there smote a lamentation, | Whence forward I intent unbar mine eyes.";musa
1;8;67-69;And the good Master said: “Even now, my son, | The city draweth near whose name is Dis, | With the grave citizens, with the great throng.”;musa
1;8;70-72;And I: “Its mosques already, Master, clearly | Within there in the valley I discern | Vermilion, as if issuing from the fire;musa
1;8;73-75;They were.“ And he to me: ”The fire eternal | That kindles them within makes them look red, | As thou beholdest in this nether Hell.“;musa
1;8;76-78;"Then we arrived within the moats profound, | That circumvallate that disconsolate city; | The walls appeared to me to be of iron.";musa
1;8;79-81;Not without making first a circuit wide, | We came unto a place where loud the pilot | Cried out to us, “Debark, here is the entrance.”;musa
1;8;82-84;More than a thousand at the gates I saw | Out of the Heavens rained down, who angrily | Were saying, “Who is this that without death;musa
1;8;85-87;Goes through the kingdom of the people dead?“ | And my sagacious Master made a sign | Of wishing secretly to speak with them.;musa
1;8;88-90;A little then they quelled their great disdain, | And said: “Come thou alone, and he begone | Who has so boldly entered these dominions.;musa
1;8;91-93;"Let him return alone by his mad road; | Try, if he can; for thou shalt here remain, | Who hast escorted him through such dark regions.“";musa
1;8;94-96;"Think, Reader, if I was discomforted | At utterance of the accursed words; | For never to return here I believed.";musa
1;8;97-99;“O my dear Guide, who more than seven times | Hast rendered me security, and drawn me | From imminent peril that before me stood,;musa
1;8;100-102;"Do not desert me,“ said I, ”thus undone; | And if the going farther be denied us, | Let us retrace our steps together swiftly.“";musa
1;8;103-105;"And that Lord, who had led me thitherward, | Said unto me: “Fear not; because our passage | None can take from us, it by Such is given.";musa
1;8;106-108;"But here await me, and thy weary spirit | Comfort and nourish with a better hope; | For in this nether world I will not leave thee.“";musa
1;8;109-111;So onward goes and there abandons me | My Father sweet, and I remain in doubt, | For No or Yes within my head contend.;musa
1;8;112-114;"I could not hear what he proposed to them; | But with them there he did not linger long, | Ere each within in rivalry ran back.";musa
1;8;115-117;They closed the portals, those our adversaries, | On my Lord’s breast, who had remained without | And turned to me with footsteps far between.;musa
1;8;118-120;His eyes cast down, his forehead shorn had he | Of all its boldness, and he said, with sighs, | “Who has denied to me the dolesome houses?”;musa
1;8;121-123;And unto me: “Thou, because I am angry, | Fear not, for I will conquer in the trial, | Whatever for defence within be planned.;musa
1;8;124-126;"This arrogance of theirs is nothing new; | For once they used it at less secret gate, | Which finds itself without a fastening still.";musa
1;8;127-129;"O’er it didst thou behold the dead inscription; | And now this side of it descends the steep, | Passing across the circles without escort,";musa
1;8;130-130;One by whose means the city shall be opened.“;musa
1;9;1-3;That hue which cowardice brought out on me, | Beholding my Conductor backward turn, | Sooner repressed within him his new color.;musa
1;9;4-6;He stopped attentive, like a man who listens, | Because the eye could not conduct him far | Through the black air, and through the heavy fog.;musa
1;9;7-9;"“Still it behoveth us to win the fight,” | Began he; “Else ... Such offered us herself ... | O how I long that some one here arrive!”";musa
1;9;10-12;"Well I perceived, as soon as the beginning | He covered up with what came afterward, | That they were words quite different from the first;";musa
1;9;13-15;But none the less his saying gave me fear, | Because I carried out the broken phrase, | Perhaps to a worse meaning than he had.;musa
1;9;16-18;“Into this bottom of the doleful conch | Doth any e’er descend from the first grade, | Which for its pain has only hope cut off?”;musa
1;9;19-21;"This question put I; and he answered me: | “Seldom it comes to pass that one of us | Maketh the journey upon which I go.";musa
1;9;22-24;True is it, once before I here below | Was conjured by that pitiless Erictho, | Who summoned back the shades unto their bodies.;musa
1;9;25-27;Naked of me short while the flesh had been, | Before within that wall she made me enter, | To bring a spirit from the circle of Judas.”;musa
1;9;28-30;"That is the lowest region and the darkest, | And farthest from the heaven which circles all. | Well know I the way; therefore be reassured.";musa
1;9;31-33;This fen, which a prodigious stench exhales, | Encompasseth about the city dolent, | Where now we cannot enter without anger.”;musa
1;9;34-36;"And more he said, but not in mind I have it; | Because mine eye had altogether drawn me | Tow’rds the high tower with the red-flaming summit.";musa
1;9;37-39;Where in a moment saw I swift uprisen | The three infernal Furies stained with blood, | Who had the limbs of women and their mien,;musa
1;9;40-42;"And with the greenest hydras were begirt; | Small serpents and cerastes were their tresses, | Wherewith their horrid temples were entwined.";musa
1;9;43-45;And he who well the handmaids of the Queen | Of everlasting lamentation knew, | Said unto me: “Behold the fierce Erinnys.;musa
1;9;46-48;"This is Megæra, on the left-hand side; | She who is weeping on the right, Alecto; | Tisiphone is between”; and then was silent.";musa
1;9;49-51;"Each one her breast was rending with her nails; | They beat them with their palms, and cried so loud, | That I for dread pressed close unto the Poet.";musa
1;9;52-54;"“Medusa come, so we to stone will change him!” | All shouted looking down; “in evil hour | Avenged we not on Theseus his assault!”";musa
1;9;55-57;“Turn thyself round, and keep thine eyes close shut, | For if the Gorgon appear, and thou shouldst see it, | No more returning upward would there be.”;musa
1;9;58-60;"Thus said the Master; and he turned me round | Himself, and trusted not unto my hands | So far as not to blind me with his own.";musa
1;9;61-63;O ye who have undistempered intellects, | Observe the doctrine that conceals itself | Beneath the veil of the mysterious verses!;musa
1;9;64-66;"And now there came across the turbid waves | The clangor of a sound with terror fraught, | Because of which both of the margins trembled;";musa
1;9;67-69;Not otherwise it was than of a wind | Impetuous on account of adverse heats, | That smites the forest, and, without restraint,;musa
1;9;70-72;"The branches rends, beats down, and bears away; | Right onward, laden with dust, it goes superb, | And puts to flight the wild beasts and the shepherds.";musa
1;9;73-75;Mine eyes he loosed, and said: “Direct the nerve | Of vision now along that ancient foam, | There yonder where that smoke is most intense.”;musa
1;9;76-78;Even as the frogs before the hostile serpent | Across the water scatter all abroad, | Until each one is huddled in the earth,;musa
1;9;79-81;More than a thousand ruined souls I saw, | Thus fleeing from before one who on foot | Was passing o’er the Styx with soles unwet.;musa
1;9;82-84;From off his face he fanned that unctuous air, | Waving his left hand oft in front of him, | And only with that anguish seemed he weary.;musa
1;9;85-87;"Well I perceived one sent from Heaven was he, | And to the Master turned; and he made sign | That I should quiet stand, and bow before him.";musa
1;9;88-90;Ah! how disdainful he appeared to me! | He reached the gate, and with a little rod | He opened it, for there was no resistance.;musa
1;9;91-93;"“O banished out of Heaven, people despised!” | Thus he began upon the horrid threshold; | “Whence is this arrogance within you couched?";musa
1;9;94-96;Wherefore recalcitrate against that will, | From which the end can never be cut off, | And which has many times increased your pain?;musa
1;9;97-99;What helpeth it to butt against the fates? | Your Cerberus, if you remember well, | For that still bears his chin and gullet peeled.”;musa
1;9;100-102;Then he returned along the miry road, | And spake no word to us, but had the look | Of one whom other care constrains and goads;musa
1;9;103-105;"Than that of him who in his presence is; | And we our feet directed tow’rds the city, | After those holy words all confident.";musa
1;9;106-108;"Within we entered without any contest; | And I, who inclination had to see | What the condition such a fortress holds,";musa
1;9;109-111;Soon as I was within, cast round mine eye, | And see on every hand an ample plain, | Full of distress and torment terrible.;musa
1;9;112-114;Even as at Aries, where stagnant grows the Rhone, | Even as at Pola near to the Quarnaro, | That shuts in Italy and bathes its borders,;musa
1;9;115-117;"The sepulchres make all the place uneven; | So likewise did they there on every side, | Saving that there the manner was more bitter.";musa
1;9;118-120;For flames between the sepulchres were scattered, | By which they so intensely heated were, | That iron more so asks not any art.;musa
1;9;121-123;All of their coverings uplifted were, | And from them issued forth such dire laments, | Sooth seemed they of the wretched and tormented.;musa
1;9;124-126;And I: “My Master, what are all those people | Who, having sepulture within those tombs, | Make themselves audible by doleful sighs?”;musa
1;9;127-129;"And he to me; “Here are the Heresiarchs, | With their disciples of all sects, and much | More than thou thinkest laden are the tombs.";musa
1;9;130-132;"Here like together with its like is buried; | And more and less the monuments are heated.” | And when he to the right had turned, we passed";musa
1;9;133-133;Between the torments and high parapets.;musa
1;10;1-3;Now onward goes, along a narrow path | Between the torments and the city wall, | My Master, and I follow at his back.;musa
1;10;4-6;"“O power supreme, that through these impious circles | Turnest me,” I began, “as pleases thee, | Speak to me, and my longings satisfy;";musa
1;10;7-9;The people who are lying in these tombs, | Might they be seen? already are uplifted | The covers all, and no one keepeth guard.”;musa
1;10;10-12;And he to me: “They all will be closed up | When from Jehosaphat they shall return | Here with the bodies they have left above.;musa
1;10;13-15;"Their cemetery have upon this side | With Epicurus all his followers, | Who with the body mortal make the soul;";musa
1;10;16-18;But in the question thou dost put to me, | Within here shalt thou soon be satisfied, | And likewise in the wish thou keepest silent.”;musa
1;10;19-21;And I: “Good Leader, I but keep concealed | From thee my heart, that I may speak the less, | Nor only now hast thou thereto disposed me.”;musa
1;10;22-24;“O Tuscan, thou who through the city of fire | Goest alive, thus speaking modestly, | Be pleased to stay thy footsteps in this place.;musa
1;10;25-27;Thy mode of speaking makes thee manifest | A native of that noble fatherland, | To which perhaps I too molestful was.”;musa
1;10;28-30;Upon a sudden issued forth this sound | From out one of the tombs: wherefore I pressed, | Fearing, a little nearer to my Leader.;musa
1;10;31-33;"And unto me he said: “Turn thee; what dost thou? | Behold there Farinata who has risen; | From the waist upwards wholly shalt thou see him.”";musa
1;10;34-36;I had already fixed mine eyes on his, | And he uprose erect with breast and front | E’en as if Hell he had in great despite.;musa
1;10;37-39;And with courageous hands and prompt my Leader | Thrust me between the sepulchres towards him, | Exclaiming, “Let thy words explicit be.”;musa
1;10;40-42;As soon as I was at the foot of his tomb, | Somewhat he eyed me, and, as if disdainful, | Then asked of me, “Who were thine ancestors?”;musa
1;10;43-45;"I, who desirous of obeying was, | Concealed it not, but all revealed to him; | Whereat he raised his brows a little upward.";musa
1;10;46-48;"Then said he: “Fiercely adverse have they been | To me, and to my fathers, and my party; | So that two several times I scattered them.”";musa
1;10;49-51;"“If they were banished, they returned on all sides,” | I answered him, “the first time and the second; | But yours have not acquired that art aright.”";musa
1;10;52-54;"Then there uprose upon the sight, uncovered | Down to the chin, a shadow at his side; | I think that he had risen on his knees.";musa
1;10;55-57;"Round me he gazed, as if solicitude | He had to see if some one else were with me; | But after his suspicion was all spent,";musa
1;10;58-60;Weeping, he said to me: “If through this blind | Prison thou goest by loftiness of genius, | Where is my son? and why is he not with thee?”;musa
1;10;61-63;"And I to him: “I come not of myself; | He who is waiting yonder leads me here, | Whom in disdain perhaps your Guido had.”";musa
1;10;64-66;"His language and the mode of punishment | Already unto me had read his name; | On that account my answer was so full.";musa
1;10;67-69;Up starting suddenly, he cried out: “How | Saidst thou,—he had? Is he not still alive? | Does not the sweet light strike upon his eyes?”;musa
1;10;70-72;When he became aware of some delay, | Which I before my answer made, supine | He fell again, and forth appeared no more.;musa
1;10;73-75;But the other, magnanimous, at whose desire | I had remained, did not his aspect change, | Neither his neck he moved, nor bent his side.;musa
1;10;76-78;“And if,” continuing his first discourse, | “They have that art,” he said, “not learned aright, | That more tormenteth me, than doth this bed.;musa
1;10;79-81;But fifty times shall not rekindled be | The countenance of the Lady who reigns here, | Ere thou shalt know how heavy is that art.;musa
1;10;82-84;And as thou wouldst to the sweet world return, | Say why that people is so pitiless | Against my race in each one of its laws?”;musa
1;10;85-87;Whence I to him: “The slaughter and great carnage | Which have with crimson stained the Arbia, | Cause such orison in our temple to be made.”;musa
1;10;88-90;After his head he with a sigh had shaken, | “There I was not alone,” he said, “nor surely | Without a cause had with the others moved.;musa
1;10;91-93;But there I was alone, where every one | Consented to the laying waste of Florence, | He who defended her with open face.”;musa
1;10;94-96;“Ah! so hereafter may your seed repose,” | I him entreated, “solve for me that knot, | Which has entangled my conceptions here.;musa
1;10;97-99;It seems that you can see, if I hear rightly, | Beforehand whatsoever brings with it, | And in the present have another mode.”;musa
1;10;100-102;"“We see, like those who have imperfect sight, | The things,” he said, “that distant are from us; | So much still shines on us the Sovereign Ruler.";musa
1;10;103-105;When they draw near, or are, is wholly vain | Our intellect, and if none brings it to us, | Not anything know we of your human state.;musa
1;10;106-108;Hence thou canst understand, that wholly dead | Will be our knowledge from the moment when | The portal of the future shall be closed.”;musa
1;10;109-111;Then I, as if compunctious for my fault, | Said: “Now, then, you will tell that fallen one, | That still his son is with the living joined.;musa
1;10;112-114;And if just now, in answering, I was dumb, | Tell him I did it because I was thinking | Already of the error you have solved me.”;musa
1;10;115-117;And now my Master was recalling me, | Wherefore more eagerly I prayed the spirit | That he would tell me who was with him there.;musa
1;10;118-120;"He said: “With more than a thousand here I lie; | Within here is the second Frederick, | And the Cardinal, and of the rest I speak not.”";musa
1;10;121-123;"Thereon he hid himself; and I towards | The ancient poet turned my steps, reflecting | Upon that saying, which seemed hostile to me.";musa

1;14;121-123;And I to him: “If so the present runnel doth take its rise in this way from our world, why only on this verge appears it to us?”;musa
1;14;124-126;And he to me: “Thou knowest the place is round, and notwithstanding thou hast journeyed far, still to the left descending to the bottom,;musa
1;14;127-129;Thou hast not yet through all the circle turned. Therefore if something new appear to us, it should not bring amazement to thy face.”;musa
1;14;130-132;And I again: “Master, where shall be found Lethe and Phlegethon, for of one thou‘rt silent, and sayest the other of this rain is made?”;musa

1;15;1-3;Now bears us onward one of the hard margins, and so the brooklet’s mist o’ershadows it, from fire it saves the water and the dikes.;musa
1;15;4-6;"Even as the Flemings, ‘twixt Cadsand and Bruges, fearing the flood that tow’rds them hurls itself, their bulwarks build to put the sea to flight;";musa
1;15;7-9;"And as the Paduans along the Brenta, to guard their villas and their villages, ere Chiarentana feels the heat;";musa
1;15;10-12;In such similitude had those been made, albeit not so lofty nor so thick, whoever he might be, the master made them.;musa
1;15;13-15;Now were we from the forest so remote, I could not have discovered where it was, even if backward I had turned myself,;musa
1;15;16-18;When we a company of souls encountered, who came beside the dike, and every one gazed at us, as at evening we are wont;musa
1;15;19-21;To eye each other under a new moon, and so towards us sharpened they their brows as an old tailor at the needle’s eye.;musa
1;15;22-24;Thus scrutinized by such a family, by some one I was recognized, who seized my garment’s hem, and cried out, “What a marvel!”;musa
1;15;25-27;And I, when he stretched forth his arm to me, on his baked aspect fastened so mine eyes, that the scorched countenance prevented not;musa
1;15;28-30;"His recognition by my intellect; and bowing down my face unto his own, I made reply, “Are you here, Ser Brunetto?”";musa

1;15;34-36;"I said to him: “With all my power I ask it; and if you wish me to sit down with you, I will, if he please, for I go with him.”";musa
1;15;37-39;“O son,” he said, “whoever of this herd a moment stops, lies then a hundred years, nor fans himself when smiteth him the fire.;musa
1;15;40-42;"Therefore go on; I at thy skirts will come, and afterward will I rejoin my band, which goes lamenting its eternal doom.”";musa
1;15;43-45;"I did not dare to go down from the road level to walk with him; but my head bowed I held as one who goeth reverently.";musa

1;15;49-51;“Up there above us in the life serene,” I answered him, “I lost me in a valley, or ever yet my age had been completed.;musa
1;15;52-54;"But yestermorn I turned my back upon it; this one appeared to me, returning thither, and homeward leadeth me along this road.”";musa
1;15;55-57;And he to me: “If thou thy star do follow, thou canst not fail thee of a glorious port, if well I judged in the life beautiful.;musa

1;15;79-81;"“If my entreaty wholly were fulfilled,” replied I to him, “not yet would you be in banishment from human nature placed;";musa

1;16;7-9;"Towards us came they, and each one cried out: “Stop, thou; for by thy garb to us thou seemest to be some one of our depraved city.”";musa
1;16;10-12;Ah me! what wounds I saw upon their limbs, recent and ancient by the flames burnt in! It pains me still but to remember it.;musa
1;16;13-15;"Unto their cries my Teacher paused attentive; he turned his face towards me, and “Now wait,” he said; “to these we should be courteous.";musa

1;16;19-21;As soon as we stood still, they recommenced the old refrain, and when they overtook us, formed of themselves a wheel, all three of them.;musa
1;16;22-24;As champions stripped and oiled are wont to do, watching for their advantage and their hold, before they come to blows and thrusts between them,;musa
1;16;25-27;Thus, wheeling round, did every one his visage direct to me, so that in opposite wise his neck and feet continual journey made.;musa

1;16;49-51;But as I should have burned and baked myself, my terror overmastered my good will, which made me greedy of embracing them.;musa
1;16;52-54;Then I began: “Sorrow and not disdain did your condition fix within me so, that tardily it wholly is stripped off,;musa

1;16;88-90;"Not an Amen could possibly be said so rapidly as they had disappeared; wherefore the Master deemed best to depart.";musa
1;16;91-93;I followed him, and little had we gone, before the sound of water was so near us, that speaking we should hardly have been heard.;musa
1;16;94-96;Even as that stream which holdeth its own course the first from Monte Veso towards the East, upon the left-hand slope of Apennine,;musa

1;16;106-108;I had a cord around about me girt, and therewithal I whilom had designed to take the panther with the painted skin.;musa
1;16;109-111;After I this had all from me unloosed, as my Conductor had commanded me, I reached it to him, gathered up and coiled,;musa
1;16;112-114;Whereat he turned himself to the right side, and at a little distance from the verge, he cast it down into that deep abyss.;musa
1;16;115-117;“It must needs be some novelty respond,” I said within myself, “to the new signal the Master with his eye is following so.”;musa
1;16;118-120;Ah me! how very cautious men should be with those who not alone behold the act, but with their wisdom look into the thoughts!;musa

1;17;1-3;Behold the monster with the pointed tail, who cleaves the hills, and breaketh walls and weapons, behold him who infecteth all the world.;musa
1;17;4-6;Thus unto me my Guide began to say, and beckoned him that he should come to shore, near to the confine of the trodden marble.;musa
1;17;7-9;And that uncleanly image of deceit came up and thrust ashore its head and bust, but on the border did not drag its tail.;musa
1;17;10-12;The face was as the face of a just man, its semblance outwardly was so benign, and of a serpent all the trunk beside.;musa
1;17;13-15;"Two paws it had, hairy unto the armpits; the back, and breast, and both sides it had depicted o’er with nooses and with shields.";musa
1;17;16-18;With colors more, groundwork or broidery never in cloth did Tartars make nor Turks, nor were such tissues by Arachne laid.;musa

1;17;22-24;"The beaver plants himself to wage his war; so that vile monster lay upon the border, which is of stone, and shuts the sand-waste in.";musa
1;17;25-27;His tail was wholly quivering in the void, contorting upwards the envenomed fork, that in the guise of scorpion armed its point.;musa
1;17;28-30;The Guide said: “Now perforce must turn aside our way a little, even to that beast malevolent, that yonder coucheth him.”;musa
1;17;31-33;We therefore on the right-hand side descended, and made ten steps upon the outer verge, completely to avoid the sand and flame.;musa
1;17;34-36;And after we are come to him, I see a little farther off upon the sand a people sitting near the hollow place.;musa
1;17;37-39;Then said to me the Master: “So that full experience of this round thou bear away, now go and see what their condition is.;musa
1;17;40-42;"There let thy conversation be concise; till thou returnest I will speak with him, that he concede to us his stalwart shoulders.”";musa
1;17;43-45;Thus farther still upon the outermost head of that seventh circle all alone I went, where sat the melancholy folk.;musa
1;17;46-48;"Out of their eyes was gushing forth their woe; this way, that way, they helped them with their hands now from the flames and now from the hot soil.";musa
1;17;49-51;Not otherwise in summer do the dogs, now with the foot, now with the muzzle, when by fleas, or flies, or gadflies, they are bitten.;musa
1;17;52-54;"When I had turned mine eyes upon the faces of some, on whom the dolorous fire is falling, not one of them I knew; but I perceived";musa
1;17;55-57;"That from the neck of each there hung a pouch, which certain color had, and certain blazon; and thereupon it seems their eyes are feeding.";musa
1;17;58-60;And as I gazing round me come among them, upon a yellow pouch I azure saw that had the face and posture of a lion.;musa
1;17;61-63;Proceeding then the current of my sight, another of them saw I, red as blood, display a goose more white than butter is.;musa
1;17;64-66;And one, who with an azure sow and gravid emblazoned had his little pouch of white, said unto me: “What dost thou in this moat?;musa

1;17;73-75;"He who shall bring the satchel with three goats’ ”; then twisted he his mouth, and forth he thrust his tongue, like to an ox that licks its nose.";musa
1;17;76-78;And fearing lest my longer stay might vex him who had warned me not to tarry long, backward I turned me from those weary souls.;musa
1;17;79-81;I found my Guide, who had already mounted upon the back of that wild animal, and said to me: “Now be both strong and bold.;musa
1;17;82-84;"Now we descend by stairways such as these; mount thou in front, for I will be midway, so that the tail may have no power to harm thee.”";musa

1;17;91-93;"I seated me upon those monstrous shoulders; I wished to say, and yet the voice came not as I believed, “Take heed that thou embrace me.”";musa
1;17;94-96;But he, who other times had rescued me in other peril, soon as I had mounted, within his arms encircled and sustained me.;musa
1;17;97-99;"And said: “Now, Geryon, bestir thyself; the circles large, and the descent be little; think of the novel burden which thou hast.”";musa
1;17;100-102;"Even as the little vessel shoves from shore, backward, still backward, so he thence withdrew; and when he wholly felt himself afloat,";musa

1;17;118-120;"I heard already on the right the whirlpool making a horrible crashing under us; whence I thrust out my head with eyes cast downward.";musa
1;17;121-123;"Then was I still more fearful of the abyss; because I fires beheld, and heard laments, whereat I, trembling, all the closer cling.";musa
1;17;124-126;I saw then, for before I had not seen it, the turning and descending, by great horrors that were approaching upon divers ;musa

1;17;136-136;He sped away as arrow from the string.;musa
1;18;1-3;There is a place in Hell called Malebolge, wholly of stone and of an iron color, as is the circle that around it turns.;musa
1;18;4-6;Right in the middle of the field malign there yawns a well exceeding wide and deep, of which its place the structure will recount.;musa
1;18;7-9;Round, then, is that enclosure which remains between the well and foot of the high, hard bank, and has distinct in valleys ten its bottom.;musa
1;18;10-12;As where for the protection of the walls many and many moats surround the castles, the part in which they are a figure forms,;musa
1;18;13-15;"Just such an image those presented there; and as about such strongholds from their gates unto the outer bank are little bridges,";musa
1;18;16-18;So from the precipice’s base did crags project, which intersected dikes and moats, unto the well that truncates and collects them.;musa
1;18;19-21;"Within this place, down shaken from the back of Geryon, we found us; and the Poet held to the left, and I moved on behind.";musa

1;18;34-36;This side and that, along the livid stone beheld I hornèd demons with great scourges, who cruelly were beating them behind.;musa
1;18;37-39;Ah me! how they did make them lift their legs at the first blows! and sooth not any one the second waited for, nor for the third.;musa
1;18;40-42;"While I was going on, mine eyes by one encountered were; and straight I said: “Already with sight of this one I am not unfed.”";musa
1;18;43-45;Therefore I stayed my feet to make him out, and with me the sweet Guide came to a stand, and to my going somewhat back assented.;musa
1;18;46-48;"And he, the scourged one, thought to hide himself, lowering his face, but little it availed him; for said I: “Thou that castest down thine eyes,";musa

1;18;79-81;From the old bridge we looked upon the train which towards us came upon the other border, and which the scourges in like manner smite.;musa
1;18;82-84;And the good Master, without my inquiring, said to me: “See that tall one who is coming and for his pain seems not to shed a tear.;musa

1;22;103-105;For one that I am will make seven to come, when I shall whistle, as our custom is to do whenever one of us emerges.”;musa
1;22;106-108;Cagnazzo at these words his muzzle lifted, shaking his head, and said: “Just hear the trick which he has thought of, down to throw himself!”;musa
1;22;109-111;Whence he, who snares in great abundance had, responded: “I by far too cunning am, when I procure for mine a greater sadness.”;musa
1;22;112-114;Alichin held not in, but running counter unto the rest, said to him: “If thou dive, I will not follow thee upon the gallop,;musa

1;22;139-141;"But sooth the other was a doughty sparhawk to clapperclaw him well; and both of them fell in the middle of the boiling pond.";musa
1;22;142-144;"A sudden intercessor was the heat; but nevertheless of rising there was naught, to such degree they had their wings belimed.";musa
1;22;145-147;Lamenting with the others, Barbariccia made four of them fly to the other side with all their gaffs, and very speedily.;musa
1;22;148-150;"This side and that they to their posts descended; they stretched their hooks towards the pitch-ensnared, who were already baked within the crust.";musa
1;22;151-151;And in this manner busied did we leave them;musa
1;23;1-3;Silent, alone, and without company, we went, the one in front, the other after, as go the Minor Friars along their way.;musa
1;23;4-6;Upon the fable of Æsop was directed my thought, by reason of the present quarrel, where he has spoken of the frog and mouse.;musa

1;23;25-27;And he: “If I were made of leaded glass, thine outward image I should not attract sooner to me than I imprint the inner.;musa
1;23;28-30;Just now thy thoughts came in among my own, with similar attitude and similar face, so that of both one counsel sole I made.;musa

1;23;34-36;Not yet he finished rendering such opinion, when I beheld them come with outstretched wings, not far remote, with will to seize upon us.;musa
1;23;37-39;My Leader on a sudden seized me up, even as a mother who by noise is wakened, and close beside her sees the enkindled flames.;musa
1;23;40-42;Who takes her son, and flies, and does not stop, having more care of him than of herself, so that she clothes her only with a shift.;musa
1;23;43-45;And downward from the top of the hard bank supine he gave him to the pendent rock, that one side of the other Bolgia walls.;musa
1;23;46-48;Ne’er ran so swiftly water through a sluice to turn the wheel of any land-built mill, when nearest to the paddles it approaches.;musa
1;23;49-51;As did my Master down along that border, bearing me with him on his breast away, as his own son, and not as a companion.;musa
1;23;52-54;"Hardly the bed of the ravine below his feet had reached, ere they had reached the hill right over us; but he was not afraid.";musa
1;23;55-57;For the high Providence, which had ordained to place them ministers of the fifth moat, the power of thence departing took from all.;musa
1;23;58-60;A painted people there below we found, who went about with footsteps very slow, weeping and in their semblance tired and vanquished.;musa
1;23;61-63;They had on mantles with the hoods low down before their eyes, and fashioned of the cut that in Cologne they for the monks are made.;musa
1;23;64-66;"Without, they gilded are so that it dazzles; but inwardly all leaden and so heavy that Frederick used to put them on of straw.";musa
1;23;67-69;O everlastingly fatiguing mantle! Again we turned us, still to the left hand along with them, intent on their sad plaint.;musa
1;23;70-72;But owing to the weight, that weary folk came on so tardily, that we were new in company at each motion of the haunch.;musa
1;23;73-75;Whence I unto my Leader: “See thou find some one who may by deed or name be known, and thus in going move thine eye about.”;musa
1;23;76-78;And one, who understood the Tuscan speech, cried to us from behind: “Stay ye your feet, ye, who so run athwart the dusky air!;musa
1;23;79-81;Perhaps thou’lt have from me what thou demandest.” Whereat the Leader turned him, and said: “Wait, and then according to his pace proceed.”;musa
1;23;82-84;"I stopped, and two beheld I show great haste of spirit, in their faces, to be with me; but the burden and the narrow way delayed them.";musa
1;23;85-87;When they came up, long with an eye askance they scanned me without uttering a word. Then to each other turned, and said together:;musa
1;23;88-90;"“He by the action of his throat seems living; and if they dead are, by what privilege go they uncovered by the heavy stole?”";musa
1;23;91-93;Then said to me: “Tuscan, who to the college of miserable hypocrites art come, do not disdain to tell us who thou art.”;musa
1;23;94-96;And I to them: “Born was I, and grew up in the great town on the fair river of Arno, and with the body am I’ve always had.;musa
1;23;97-99;But who are ye, in whom there trickles down along your cheeks such grief as I behold? And what pain is upon you, that so sparkles?”;musa
1;23;100-102;And one replied to me: “These orange cloaks are made of lead so heavy, that the weights cause in this way their balances to creak.;musa
1;23;103-105;"Frati Gaudenti were we, and Bolognese; I Catalano, and he Loderingo named, and together taken by thy city.";musa
1;23;106-108;"As the wont is to take one man alone, for maintenance of its peace; and we were such that still it is apparent round Gardingo.”";musa
1;23;109-111;"“O Friars,” began I, “your iniquitous...” But said no more; for to mine eyes there rushed one crucified with three stakes on the ground.";musa
1;23;112-114;"When me he saw, he writhed himself all over, blowing into his beard with suspirations; and the Friar Catalan, who noticed this,";musa
1;23;115-117;Said to me: “This transfixed one, who thou seest, counselled the Pharisees that it was meet to put one man to torture for the people.;musa
1;23;118-120;"Crosswise and naked is he on the path, as thou perceivest; and he needs must feel, whoever passes, first how much he weighs.";musa
1;23;121-123;And in like mode his father-in-law is punished within this moat, and the others of the council, which for the Jews was a malignant seed.”;musa
1;23;124-126;And thereupon I saw Virgilius marvel o’er him who was extended on the cross so vilely in eternal banishment.;musa
1;23;127-129;Then he directed to the Friar this voice: “Be not displeased, if granted thee, to tell us if to the right hand any pass slope down;musa
1;23;130-132;By which we two may issue forth from here, without constraining some of the black angels to come and extricate us from this deep.”;musa
1;23;133-135;Then he made answer: “Nearer than thou hopest there is a rock, that forth from the great circle proceeds, and crosses all the cruel valleys.;musa
1;23;136-138;"Save that at this ‘tis broken, and does not bridge it; you will be able to mount up the ruin, that sidelong slopes and at the bottom rises.”";musa
1;23;139-141;"The Leader stood awhile with head bowed down; then said: “The business badly he recounted who grapples with his hook the sinners yonder.”";musa
1;23;142-144;And the Friar: “Many of the Devil’s vices once heard I at Bologna, and among them, that he’s a liar and the father of lies.”;musa
1;23;145-147;"Thereat my Leader with great strides went on, somewhat disturbed by anger in his looks; whence from the heavy-laden I departed.";musa
1;23;148-148;After the prints of his beloved feet.;musa
1;24;1-3;In that part of the youthful year wherein the Sun his locks beneath Aquarius tempers, and now the nights draw near to half the day,;musa
1;24;4-6;What time the hoar-frost copies on the ground the outward semblance of her sister white, but little lasts the temper of her pen,;musa
1;24;7-9;The husbandman, whose forage faileth him, rises, and looks, and seeth the champaign all gleaming white, whereat he beats his flank,;musa
1;24;10-12;"Returns indoors, and up and down laments, like a poor wretch, who knows not what to do; then he returns, and hope revives again,";musa
1;24;13-15;Seeing the world has changed its countenance in little time, and takes his shepherd’s crook, and forth the little lambs to pasture drives.;musa
1;24;16-18;Thus did the Master fill me with alarm, when I beheld his forehead so disturbed, and to the ailment came as soon the plaster.;musa
1;24;19-21;For as we came unto the ruined bridge, the Leader turned to me with that sweet look which at the mountain’s foot I first beheld.;musa
1;24;22-24;His arms he opened, after some advisement within himself elected, looking first well at the ruin, and laid hold of me.;musa
1;24;25-27;And even as he who acts and meditates, for aye it seems that he provides beforehand, so upward lifting me towards the summit;musa
1;24;28-30;Of a huge rock, he scanned another crag, saying: “To that one grapple afterwards, but try first if ‘tis such that it will hold thee.”;musa
1;24;31-33;"This was no path for one clothed with a cloak; for hardly we, he light, and I pushed upward, were able to ascend from jag to jag.";musa
1;24;34-36;And had it not been, that upon that precinct shorter was the ascent than on the other, he I know not, but I had been dead beat.;musa
1;24;37-39;But because Malebolge tow’rds the mouth of the profoundest well is all inclining, the structure of each valley doth import;musa
1;24;40-42;That one bank rises and the other sinks. Still we arrived at length upon the point wherefrom the last stone breaks itself asunder.;musa
1;24;43-45;The breath was from my lungs so milked away, when I was up, that I could go no farther, nay, I sat down upon my first arrival.;musa
1;24;46-48;"“Now it behoves thee thus to put off sloth,” my Master said; “for sitting upon down, or under quilt, one cometh not to fame,";musa
1;24;49-51;Withouten which whoso his life consumes such vestige leaveth of himself on earth, as smoke in air or in the water foam.;musa
1;24;52-54;And therefore raise thee up, o’ercome the anguish with spirit that o’ercometh every battle, if with its heavy body it sink not.;musa
1;24;55-57;"A longer stairway it behoves thee mount; ‘tis not enough from these to have departed; let it avail thee, if thou understand me.”";musa
1;24;58-60;Then I uprose, showing myself provided better with breath than I did feel myself, and said: “Go on, for I am strong and bold.”;musa
1;24;61-63;Upward we took our way along the crag, which jagged was, and narrow, and difficult, and more precipitous far than that before.;musa
1;24;64-66;"Speaking I went, not to appear exhausted; whereat a voice from the next moat came forth, not well adapted to articulate words.";musa
1;24;67-69;"I know not what it said, though o’er the back I now was of the arch that passes there; but he seemed moved to anger who was speaking.";musa
1;24;70-72;"I was bent downward, but my living eyes could not attain the bottom, for the dark; wherefore I: “Master, see that thou arrive";musa
1;24;73-75;"At the next round, and let us descend the wall; for as from hence I hear and understand not, so I look down and nothing I distinguish.”";musa
1;24;76-78;"“Other response,” he said, “I make thee not, except the doing; for the modest asking ought to be followed by the deed in silence.”";musa
1;24;79-81;We from the bridge descended at its head, where it connects itself with the eighth bank, and then was manifest to me the Bolgia.;musa
1;24;82-84;And I beheld therein a terrible throng of serpents, and of such a monstrous kind, that the remembrance still congeals my blood.;musa
1;24;85-87;"Let Lybia boast no longer with her sand; for it Chelydri, Jaculi, and Phareae she breeds, with Cenchri and with Amphisbaena,";musa
1;24;88-90;Neither so many plagues nor so malignant e’er showed she with all Ethiopia, nor with whatever on the Red Sea is!;musa
1;24;91-93;Among this cruel and most dismal throng people were running naked and affrighted, without the hope of hole or heliotrope.;musa
1;24;94-96;"They had their hands with serpents bound behind them; these riveted upon their reins the tail and head, and were in front of them entwined.";musa
1;24;97-99;And lo! at one who was upon our side there darted forth a serpent, which transfixed him there where the neck is knotted to the shoulders.;musa
1;24;100-102;"Nor O so quickly e’er, nor I was written, as he took fire, and burned; and ashes wholly behoved it that in falling he became.";musa
1;24;103-105;And when he on the ground was thus destroyed, the ashes drew together, and of themselves into himself they instantly returned.;musa
1;24;106-108;"Even thus by the great sages ‘tis confessed the phoenix dies, and then is born again, when it approaches its five-hundredth year;";musa
1;24;109-111;On herb or grain it feeds not in its life, but only on tears of incense and amomum, and nard and myrrh are its last winding-sheet.;musa
1;24;112-114;And as he is who falls, and knows not how, by force of demons who to earth down drag him, or other oppilation that binds man,;musa
1;24;115-117;"When he arises and around him looks, wholly bewildered by the mighty anguish which he has suffered, and in looking sighs;";musa
1;24;118-120;Such was that sinner after he had risen. Justice of God! O how severe it is, that blows like these in vengeance poureth down!;musa
1;24;121-123;"The Guide thereafter asked him who he was; whence he replied: “I rained from Tuscany a short time since I came into this cruel gorge.";musa
1;24;124-126;"A bestial life, and not a human, pleased me, even as the mule I was; I’m Vanni Fucci, beast, and Pistoia was my worthy den.”";musa
1;24;127-129;And I unto the Guide: “Tell him to stir not, and ask what crime has thrust him here below, for once a man of blood and wrath I saw him.”;musa
1;24;130-132;And the sinner, who had heard, dissembled not, but unto me directed mind and face, and with a melancholy shame was painted.;musa
1;24;133-135;Then said: “It pains me more that thou hast caught me amid this misery where thou seest me, than when I from the other life was taken.;musa
1;24;136-138;"What thou demandest I cannot deny; so low am I put down because I robbed the sacristy of the fair ornaments,";musa
1;24;139-141;"And falsely once ‘twas laid upon another; but that thou mayst not such a sight enjoy, if thou shalt e’er be out of the dark places,";musa

1;24;151-151;And this I’ve said that it may give thee pain.”;musa
1;25;1-3;At the conclusion of his words, the thief lifted his hands aloft with both the figs, crying: “Take that, God, for at thee I aim them.”;musa
1;25;4-6;"From that time forth the serpents were my friends; for one entwined itself about his neck as if it said: “I will not thou speak more.”";musa
1;25;7-9;And round his arms another, and rebound him, clinching itself together so in front, that with them he could not a motion make.;musa
1;25;10-12;Pistoia, ah, Pistoia! why resolve not to burn thyself to ashes and so perish, since in ill-doing thou thy seed excellest?;musa

1;25;16-18;"He fled away, and spake no further word; and I beheld a Centaur full of rage come crying out: “Where is, where is the scoffer?”";musa
1;25;19-21;I do not think Maremma has so many serpents as he had all along his back, as far as where our countenance begins.;musa
1;25;22-24;Upon the shoulders, just behind the nape, with wings wide open was a dragon lying, and he sets fire to all that he encounters.;musa
1;25;25-27;My Master said: “That one is Cacus, who beneath the rock upon Mount Aventine created oftentimes a lake of blood.;musa
1;25;28-30;He goes not on the same road with his brothers, by reason of the fraudulent theft he made of the great herd, which he had near to him.;musa
1;25;31-33;Whereat his tortuous actions ceased beneath the mace of Hercules, who peradventure gave him a hundred, and he felt not ten.”;musa
1;25;34-36;While he was speaking thus, he had passed by, and spirits three had underneath us come, of which nor I aware was, nor my Leader,;musa
1;25;37-39;Until what time they shouted: “Who are you?” on which account our story made a halt, and then we were intent on them alone.;musa
1;25;40-42;"I did not know them; but it came to pass, as it is wont to happen by some chance, that one to name the other was compelled,";musa
1;25;43-45;Exclaiming: “Where can Cianfa have remained?” whence I, so that the Leader might attend, upward from chin to nose my finger laid.;musa
1;25;46-48;If thou art, Reader, slow now to believe what I shall say, it will no marvel be, for I who saw it hardly can admit it.;musa
1;25;49-51;As I was holding raised on them my brows, behold! a serpent with six feet darts forth in front of one, and fastens wholly on him.;musa
1;25;52-54;"With middle feet it bound him round the paunch, and with the forward ones his arms it seized; then thrust its teeth through one cheek and the other.";musa
1;25;55-57;The hindermost it stretched upon his thighs, and put its tail through in between the two, and up behind along the reins outspread it.;musa
1;25;58-60;Ivy was never fastened by its barbs unto a tree so, as this horrible reptile upon the other’s limbs entwined its own.;musa
1;25;61-63;"Then they stuck close, as if of heated wax they had been made, and intermixed their color; nor one nor other seemed now what he was.";musa
1;25;64-66;E‘en as proceedeth on before the flame upward along the paper a brown color, which is not black as yet, and the white dies.;musa
1;25;67-69;The other two looked on, and each of them cried out: “O me, Agnello, how thou changest! Behold, thou now art neither two nor one.”;musa
1;25;70-72;Already the two heads had one become, when there appeared to us two figures mingled into one face, wherein the two were lost.;musa
1;25;73-75;Of the four lists were fashioned the two arms, the thighs and legs, the belly and the chest, members became that never yet were seen.;musa
1;25;76-78;"Every original aspect there was cancelled; two and yet none did the perverted image appear, and such departed with slow pace.";musa

1;25;82-84;Thus did appear, coming towards the bellies of the two others, a small fiery serpent, livid and black as is a peppercorn.;musa
1;25;85-87;"And in that part whereat is first received our ailment, it one of them transfixed; then downward fell in front of him extended.";musa

1;25;91-93;"He at the serpent gazed, and it at him; one through the wound, the other through the mouth smoked violently, and the smoke commingled.";musa
1;25;94-96;Henceforth be silent Lucan, where he mentions wretched Sabellus and Nassidius, and wait to hear what now shall be shot forth.;musa
1;25;97-99;"Be silent Ovid, of Cadmus and Arethusa; for if him to a snake, her to a fountain, converts he fabling, that I grudge him not.";musa
1;25;100-102;Because two natures never front to front has he transmuted, so that both the forms to interchange their matter ready were.;musa
1;25;103-105;Together they responded in such wise, that to a fork the serpent cleft his tail, and eke the wounded drew his feet together.;musa
1;25;106-108;The legs together with the thighs themselves adhered so, that in little time the juncture no sign whatever made that was apparent.;musa
1;25;109-111;He with the cloven tail assumed the figure the other one was losing, and his skin became elastic, and the other’s hard.;musa
1;25;112-114;I saw the arms draw inward at the armpits, and both feet of the reptile, that were short, lengthen as much as those contracted were.;musa
1;25;115-117;Thereafter the hind feet, together twisted, became the member that a man conceals, and of his own the wretch had two created.;musa
1;25;118-120;While both of them the exhalation veils with a new color, and engenders hair on one of them and depilates the other.;musa
1;25;121-123;The one uprose and down the other fell, though turning not away their impious lamps, underneath which each one his muzzle changed.;musa
1;25;124-126;He who was standing drew it tow’rds the temples, and from excess of matter, which came thither, issued the ears from out the hollow cheeks.;musa
1;25;127-129;What did not backward run and was retained of that excess made to the face a nose, and the lips thickened far as was befitting.;musa
1;25;130-132;He who lay prostrate thrusts his muzzle forward, and backward draws the ears into his head, in the same manner as the snail its horns.;musa

a leopard, light and lively, svelte and quick,
its coat displaying a dappled marking.";kirkpatrick

The sun was mounting, and those springtime stars
that rose along with it when Holy Love";kirkpatrick

So these – the morning hour, the gentle season –
led me to find good reason for my hopes,";kirkpatrick

Yet not so far that no fear pressed on me,
to see, appearing now, a lion face.";kirkpatrick

drove me back down to where the sun is mute.";kirkpatrick

there had, before my eyes, been offered one
who seemed – long silent – to be faint and dry.";kirkpatrick

1;2;37-39;And so – as though unwanting every want, | so altering all at every altering thought, | now drawing back from everything begun –;kirkpatrick

1;2;97-99;She called Lucia, seeking her reply. | ‘Your faithful one,’ she said to her, ‘has now | great need of you. I give him to your care.’;kirkpatrick
1;2;100-102;Lucia is the enemy of harm. | Leaving her place, she came at once to where | I sat – Rachel, long-famed, along with me.;kirkpatrick
1;2;103-105;‘You, Beatrice, are, in truth, God’s praise. | Why not,’ she said, ‘make haste to him? He loves you, | and, loving you, he left the common herd.;kirkpatrick
1;2;106-108;Can you not hear the pity of his tears? | Do you not see the death that beats him down, | swirling in torrents that no sea could boast?’;kirkpatrick
1;2;109-111;No one on earth has ever run more rapidly | to seek advantage or else flee from harm, | than I in coming – when her words were done –;kirkpatrick
1;2;112-114;down from that throne of happiness, to trust | in your great words, their dignity and truth. | These honour you and those who hear you speak.;kirkpatrick
1;2;115-117;When she had said her say, in tears, she turned | her eyes away – which shone as she was weeping. | And this made me far quicker still for you.;kirkpatrick
1;2;118-120;So now, as she had willed, I made my way, | to raise you from the face of that brute beast | that stole your pathway up that lovely hill.;kirkpatrick
1;2;121-123;What is it, then? What’s wrong? Why still delay? | Why fondle in your heart such feebleness? | Why wait? Be forthright, brave and resolute.;kirkpatrick
1;2;124-126;Three ladies of the court of Paradise, | in utmost happiness watch over you. | My own words promise you the utmost good.’;kirkpatrick
1;2;127-129;As little flowers bend low on freezing nights, | closed tight, but then, as sunlight whitens them, grow | upright on their stems and fully open,;kirkpatrick
1;2;130-132;now so did I. My wearied powers reviving, | there ran such wealth of boldness to my heart | that openly – all new and free – I now began:;kirkpatrick
1;2;133-135;‘How quick in compassion her aid to me! | And you – so courteous, prompt to accede | to all the words of truth that she has offered!;kirkpatrick
1;2;136-138;You, as you speak, have so disposed my heart | in keen desire to journey on the way | that I return to find my first good purpose.;kirkpatrick
1;2;139-141;Set off! A single will inspires us both. | You are my lord, my leader and true guide.’ | All this I said to him as he moved on.;kirkpatrick
1;2;142-142;I entered on that deep and wooded road.;kirkpatrick
1;3;1-3;Through me you go to the grief-wracked city, through me to everlasting pain you go, through me you go and pass among lost souls.;kirkpatrick
1;3;4-6;Justice inspired my exalted Creator, I am a creature of the Holiest Power, of Wisdom in the Highest and of Primal Love.;kirkpatrick
1;3;7-9;Nothing till I was made was made, only eternal beings, and I endure eternally. Surrender as you enter every hope you have.;kirkpatrick
1;3;10-12;These were the words that—written in dark tones—I saw there, on the summit of a door. I turned: ‘Their meaning, sir, for me is hard.’;kirkpatrick
1;3;13-15;And he in answering (as though he understood): ‘You needs must here surrender all your doubts, all taint of cowardice must here be dead.;kirkpatrick
1;3;16-18;We now have come where, as I have said, you’ll see in suffering the souls of those who’ve lost the good that intellect desires to win.’;kirkpatrick
1;3;19-21;And then he placed his hand around my own, he smiled, to give me some encouragement, and set me on to enter secret things.;kirkpatrick
1;3;22-24;Sighing, sobbing, moans and plaintive wailing all echoed here through air where no star shone, and I, as this began, began to weep.;kirkpatrick
1;3;25-27;Discordant tongues, harsh accents of horror, tormented words, the twang of rage, strident voices, the sound, as well, of smacking hands.;kirkpatrick
1;3;28-30;Together these all stirred a storm that swirled forever in the darkened air where no time was, as sand swept up in breathing spires of wind.;kirkpatrick
1;3;31-33;I turned, my head tight-bound in confusion, to say to my master: ‘What is it that I hear? Who can these be, so overwhelmed by pain?’;kirkpatrick
1;3;34-36;‘This baleful condition is one,’ he said, ‘that grips those souls whose lives, contemptibly, were void alike of honor and ill fame.;kirkpatrick
1;3;37-39;These all co-mingle with a noisome choir of angels who—not rebels, yet not true to God—existed for themselves alone.;kirkpatrick
1;3;40-42;To keep their beauty whole, the Heavens spurned them. Nor would the depths of Hell receive them in, lest truly wicked souls boast over them.’;kirkpatrick
1;3;43-45;And I: ‘What can it be, so harsh, so heavy, that draws such loud lamentings from these crowds?’ And he replied: ‘My answer can be brief.;kirkpatrick
1;3;46-48;These have no hope that death will ever come, and so degraded is the life they lead all look with envy on all other fates.;kirkpatrick
1;3;49-51;The world allows no glory to their name. Mercy and Justice alike despise them. Let us not speak of them. Look, then pass on.’;kirkpatrick
1;3;52-54;I did look, intently. I saw a banner running so rapidly, whirling forwards, that nothing, it seemed, would ever grant a pause.;kirkpatrick
1;3;55-57;Drawn by that banner was so long a trail of men and women I should not have thought that death could ever have unmade so many.;kirkpatrick
1;3;58-60;A few I recognized. And then I saw—and knew beyond all doubt—the shadow of the one who made, from cowardice, the great denial.;kirkpatrick
1;3;61-63;So I, at that instant, was wholly sure this congregation was that worthless mob loathsome alike to God and their own enemies.;kirkpatrick
1;3;64-66;These wretched souls were never truly live. They now went naked and were sharply spurred by wasps and hornets, thriving all around.;kirkpatrick
1;3;67-69;"The insects streaked the face of each with blood. Mixing with tears, the lines ran down; and then were garnered at their feet by filthy worms.";kirkpatrick
1;3;70-72;And when I’d got myself to look beyond, others, I saw, were ranged along the bank of some great stream. ‘Allow me, sir,’ I said.;kirkpatrick
1;3;73-75;‘To know who these might be. What drives them on, and makes them all (as far, in this weak light, as I discern) so eager for the crossing?’;kirkpatrick
1;3;76-78;‘That will, of course, be clear to you,’ he said, ‘when once our footsteps are set firm upon the melancholic shores of Acheron.’;kirkpatrick
1;3;79-81;At this—ashamed, my eyes cast humbly down, fearing my words had weighed on him too hard—I held my tongue until we reached the stream.;kirkpatrick
1;3;82-84;Look now! Towards us in a boat there came an old man, yelling, hair all white and aged, ‘Degenerates! Your fate is sealed! Cry woe!;kirkpatrick
1;3;85-87;Don’t hope you’ll ever see the skies again! I’m here to lead you to the farther shore, into eternal shadow, heat and chill.;kirkpatrick
1;3;88-90;And you there! You! Yes, you, the living soul! Get right away from this gang! These are dead.’ But then, on seeing that I did not move.;kirkpatrick
1;3;91-93;‘You will arrive by other paths and ports. You’ll start your journey from a different beach. A lighter hull must carry you across.’;kirkpatrick
1;3;94-96;‘Charon,’ my leader, ‘don’t torment yourself. For this is willed where all is possible that is willed there. And so demand no more.’;kirkpatrick
1;3;97-99;The fleecy wattles of the ferry man—who plied across the liverish swamp, eyeballs encircled by two wheels of flame—fell mute.;kirkpatrick
1;3;100-102;But not the other souls. Naked and drained, their complexions changed. Their teeth began (hearing his raw command) to gnash and grind.;kirkpatrick
1;3;103-105;They raged, blaspheming God and their own kin, the human race, the place and time, the seed from which they’d sprung, the day that they’d been born.;kirkpatrick
1;3;106-108;And then they came together all as one, wailing aloud along the evil margin that waits for all who have no fear of God.;kirkpatrick
1;3;109-111;Charon the demon, with his hot-coal eyes, glared what he meant to do. He swept all in. He struck at any dawdler with his oar.;kirkpatrick
1;3;112-114;In autumn, leaves are lifted, one by one, away until the branch looks down and sees its tatters all arrayed upon the ground.;kirkpatrick
1;3;115-117;In that same way did Adam’s evil seed hurtle, in sequence, from the river rim, as birds that answer to their handler’s call.;kirkpatrick
1;3;118-120;Then off they went, to cross the darkened flood. And, long before they’d landed over there, another flock assembled in their stead.;kirkpatrick
1;3;121-123;Attentively, my master said: ‘All those, dear son, who perish in the wrath of God, meet on this shore, wherever they were born.;kirkpatrick
1;3;124-126;And they are eager to be shipped across. Justice of God so spurs them all ahead that fear in them becomes that sharp desire.;kirkpatrick
1;3;127-129;But no good soul will ever leave from here. And so when Charon thus complains of you, you may well grasp the sense that sounds within.’;kirkpatrick
1;3;130-132;His words now done, the desolate terrain trembled with such great violence that the thought soaks me once more in a terrified sweat.;kirkpatrick
1;3;133-135;The tear-drenched earth gave out a gust of wind, erupting in a flash of bright vermilion, that overwhelmed all conscious sentiment. ;kirkpatrick
1;3;136-136;I fell like someone gripped by sudden sleep.;kirkpatrick
1;4;1-3;Thunder rolling heavily in my head shattered my deep sleep. Startled, I awoke – as though just shaken in some violent grip.;kirkpatrick
1;4;4-6; And then once more my sight grew firm and fixed. Now upright and again afoot, I scanned, intently, all around to view where I might be.  ;kirkpatrick
1;4;7-9;I found I’d reached – and this is true – the edge of the abyss, that cavern of grief and pain that rings a peal of endless miseries. ;kirkpatrick
1;4;10-12;The pit, so dark, so wreathed in cloud, went down so far that – peering towards its deepest floor – I still could not discern a single thing.;kirkpatrick
1;4;13-15; ‘Let us descend,’ the poet now began, ‘and enter this blind world.’ His face was pale. ‘I shall go first. Then you come close behind.’ ;kirkpatrick
1;4;16-18; I was aware of his altered colour. ‘How can I come, when you,’ I said, ‘my strength in every time of doubt, are terrified?’ ;kirkpatrick
1;4;19-21;‘It is the agony,’ he answered me, ‘of those below that paints my features thus – not fear, as you suppose it is, but pity.;kirkpatrick
1;4;22-24; ‘Let us go on. The long road spurs our pace.’ So now he set himself – and me as well – to enter Circle One, which skirts the emptiness. ;kirkpatrick
1;4;25-27; Here in the dark (where only hearing told) there were no tears, no weeping, only sighs that caused a trembling in the eternal air – ;kirkpatrick
1;4;28-30;sighs drawn from sorrowing, although no pain. This weighs on all of them, those multitudes of speechless children, women and full-grown men.;kirkpatrick
1;4;31-33; ‘You do not ask,’ my teacher in his goodness said, ‘who all these spirits are that you see here? Do not, I mean, go further till you know:  ;kirkpatrick
1;4;34-36;these never sinned. And some attained to merit. But merit falls far short. None was baptized. None passed the gate, in your belief, to faith. ;kirkpatrick
1;4;37-39;They lived before the Christian age began. They paid no reverence, as was due to God. And in this number I myself am one.;kirkpatrick
1;4;40-42; For such deficiencies, no other crime, we all are lost yet only suffer harm through living in desire, but hopelessly.’;kirkpatrick
1;4;43-45;  At hearing this, great sorrow gripped my heart. For many persons of the greatest worth were held, I knew, suspended on this strip. ;kirkpatrick
1;4;46-48;‘Tell me, sir, tell me, my dearest teacher,’ so I began, determined – on a point of faith, which routs all error – to be sure,;kirkpatrick
1;4;49-51; ‘has anyone, by merit of his own or else another’s, left here then been blessed?’ And he, who read the sense my words had hid,;kirkpatrick
1;4;52-54;  answered: ‘I still was new to this strange state when, now advancing, I beheld a power whose head was crowned with signs of victory. ;kirkpatrick
1;4;55-57;He led away the shadow of our primal sire, shades of his offspring, Abel and Noah, Moses, who uttered (and observed) the law,;kirkpatrick
1;4;58-60; of Abraham the patriarch, David the king, Israel, his father and his own twelve sons, with Rachel, too, for whom he laboured long,  ;kirkpatrick
1;4;61-63;and many more besides. All these He blessed. This too I mean you’ll know: until these were, no human soul had ever been redeemed.’ ;kirkpatrick
1;4;64-66;Speak as he might, our journey did not pause, but on we went, and onward, through the wood – the wood, I mean, of spirits thronging round.;kirkpatrick
1;4;67-69; Our steps were still not far from where, in sleep, I fell, when now, ahead, I saw a fire that overcame a hemisphere of shade. ;kirkpatrick
1;4;70-72; From this we were, as yet, some paces off, but not so far that I should fail to see that men of honour made this place their own. ;kirkpatrick
1;4;73-75;‘Honour you bring, my lord, to art and learning. Inform me who these are – their honour great – who stand apart in some way from the rest.’;kirkpatrick
1;4;76-78; He answered me: ‘The honour of their name rings clear for those, like you, who live above, and here gains favour out of Heaven’s grace.’ ;kirkpatrick
1;4;79-81; And then there came upon my ear a voice: ‘Honour be his, the poet in the heights. His shadow now returns which had departed.’ ;kirkpatrick
1;4;82-84;The voice was still and silent once again. And now, I saw, there came four noble shades, no sorrow in their countenance, nor joy.;kirkpatrick
1;4;85-87; My teacher – that good man – began to speak: ‘Look on. Behold the one who, sword in hand, precedes, as their true lord, the other three.  ;kirkpatrick
1;4;88-90;This is that sovereign Homer, poet. Horace the satirist is next to come, Ovid is third. Then (see!) there is Lucan. ;kirkpatrick
1;4;91-93;All these, by right, must duly share with me the name that sounded in that single voice. They do me honour thus, and thus do well.’;kirkpatrick
1;4;94-96; And so I saw, assembling there as one, the lovely college of that lord of song whose verses soar like eagles over all.;kirkpatrick
1;4;97-99;Some little time they talked among themselves, then turned to me and offered signs of greeting.;kirkpatrick
1;4;100-102; On seeing all of this, my teacher smiled.  And greater honour still they paid me now: they summoned me to join them in their ranks. I came and walked as sixth among such wisdom.;kirkpatrick
1;4;103-105; So on we went to reach the dome of light and spoke of things which, proper where I was, are relegated, rightly, here to silence. ;kirkpatrick
1;4;106-108; We reached the footings of a noble fort, circled around by seven curtain walls and also, as its moat, a lovely stream. ;kirkpatrick
1;4;109-111;We passed this brook as though it were dry land. Through seven gates I went with these five sages. We then came out upon a verdant lawn.;kirkpatrick
1;4;112-114;" Here there were some whose eyes were firm and grave – all, in demeanour, of authority – who seldom spoke; their tones were calm and gentle. ";kirkpatrick
1;4;115-117; And so we drew aside and found a space, illuminated, open, high and airy, where all of these were able to be seen. ;kirkpatrick
1;4;118-120;And there, across that bright enamelled green, these ancient heroes were displayed to me. And I within myself am still raised high  at what I saw:;kirkpatrick
1;4;121-123; Electra, many round her. Hector I recognized, Aeneas, too, and Caesar in arms, with his hawk-like eyes. ;kirkpatrick
1;4;124-126; Camilla I saw and Penthesilea, and King Latinus on the other side – his daughter seated with him, his Lavinia. ;kirkpatrick
1;4;127-129;Brutus (he drove proud Tarquin out), Lucrece and Julia, Marcia, Cornelia – all these I saw, and there alone, apart, the sultan Saladin.;kirkpatrick
1;4;130-132; And then – my brow raised higher still – I saw, among his family of philosophers, the master of all those who think and know. ;kirkpatrick
1;4;133-135; To him all look in wonder, all in honour. And, closer to his side than all the rest, I now saw Socrates, I saw now Plato, ;kirkpatrick
1;4;136-138;and one, Democritus, who claims the world is chance, Diogenes and Tales, Anaxagoras, Empedocles, Heraclitus and Zeno.;kirkpatrick
1;4;139-141; Then one I saw who gathered healing herbs – I mean good Dioscorides. Orpheus I saw, and Seneca the moralist, Linus, Tully,;kirkpatrick
1;4;142-144; Euclid (geometer) and Ptolemy, Hippocrates, Avicenna and Galen, Averroes, too, who made the Commentary. ;kirkpatrick
1;4;145-147;"I cannot here draw portraits of them all; my lengthy subject presses me ahead, and saying often falls far short of fact.";kirkpatrick
1;4;148-150; That company of six declines to two. My lord in wisdom leads a different way, out of that quiet into trembling air. ;kirkpatrick
1;4;151-151; And nothing, where I now arrive, is shining.;kirkpatrick
1;5;1-3;And so from Circle One I now went down, deeper, to Circle Two, which bounds a lesser space and therefore greater suffering. Its sting is misery.;kirkpatrick
1;5;4-6;Minos stands there – horribly there – and barking. He, on the threshold, checks degrees of guilt, then judges and dispatches with his twirling tail.;kirkpatrick
1;5;7-9;I mean that every ill-begotten creature, when summoned here, confesses everything. And he (his sense of sin is very fine);kirkpatrick
1;5;10-12;perceives what place in Hell best suits each one, and coils his tail around himself to tell the numbered ring to which he’ll send them down.;kirkpatrick
1;5;13-15;Before him, always, stands a crowd of souls. By turns they go, each one, for sentencing. Each pleads, attends – and then is tipped below.;kirkpatrick
1;5;16-18;‘You there, arriving at this house of woe,’ so, when he saw me there, the judge spoke forth, to interrupt a while his formal role.;kirkpatrick
1;5;19-21;‘Watch as you enter – and in whom you trust. Don’t let yourself be fooled by this wide threshold.’ My leader’s thrust: ‘This yelling! Why persist?;kirkpatrick
1;5;22-24;Do not impede him on his destined way. For this is willed where all is possible that is willed there. And so demand no more.’;kirkpatrick
1;5;25-27;But now the tones of pain, continuing, demand I hear them out. And now I’ve come where grief and weeping pierce me at the heart.;kirkpatrick
1;5;28-30;And so I came where light is mute, a place that moans as oceans do impelled by storms, surging, embattled in conflicting squalls.;kirkpatrick
1;5;31-33;The swirling wind of Hell will never rest. It drags these spirits onwards in its force. It chafes them – rolling, clashing – grievously.;kirkpatrick
1;5;34-36;Then, once they reach the point from which they fell… screams, keening cries, the agony of all, and all blaspheming at the Holy Power.;kirkpatrick
1;5;37-39;Caught in this torment, as I understood, were those who – here condemned for carnal sin – made reason bow to their instinctual bent.;kirkpatrick
1;5;40-42;As starlings on the wing in winter chills are borne along in wide and teeming flocks, so on these breathing gusts the evil souls.;kirkpatrick
1;5;43-45;This way and that and up and down they’re borne. Here is no hope of any comfort ever, neither of respite nor of lesser pain.;kirkpatrick
1;5;46-48;And now, as cranes go singing lamentations and form themselves through air in long-drawn lines, coming towards me, trailing all their sorrows,;kirkpatrick
1;5;49-51;I saw new shadows lifted by this force. ‘Who are these people? Tell me, sir,’ I said, ‘why black air scourges them so viciously.’;kirkpatrick
1;5;52-54;‘The first of those whose tale you wish to hear,’ he answered me without a moment’s pause, ‘governed as empress over diverse tongues.;kirkpatrick
1;5;55-57;She was so wracked by lust and luxury, licentiousness was legal under laws she made – to lift the blame that she herself incurred.;kirkpatrick
1;5;58-60;This is Semiramis. Of her one reads that she, though heir to Ninus, was his bride. Her lands were those where now the Sultan reigns.;kirkpatrick
1;5;61-63;The other, lovelorn, slew herself and broke her vow of faith to Sichaeus’s ashes. And next, so lascivious, Cleopatra.;kirkpatrick
1;5;64-66;Helen. You see? Because of her, a wretched waste of years went by. See! Great Achilles. He fought with love until his final day.;kirkpatrick
1;5;67-69;Paris you see, and Tristan there.’ And more than a thousand shadows he numbered, naming them all, whom Love had led to leave our life.;kirkpatrick
1;5;70-72;Hearing that man of learning herald thus these chevaliers of old, and noble ladies, pity oppressed me and I was all but lost.;kirkpatrick
1;5;73-75;‘How willingly,’ I turned towards the poet, ‘I’d speak to those two there who go conjoined and look to be so light upon the wind.’;kirkpatrick
1;5;76-78;And he to me: ‘You’ll see them clearer soon. When they are closer, call to them. Invoke the love that draws them on, and they will come.’;kirkpatrick
1;5;79-81;The wind had swept them nearer to us now. I moved to them in words: ‘Soul-wearied creatures! Come, if none forbids, to us and, breathless, speak.’;kirkpatrick
1;5;82-84;As doves, when called by their desires, will come – wings spreading high – to settle on their nest, borne through the air by their own steady will,;kirkpatrick
1;5;85-87;so these two left the flock where Dido is. They came, approaching through malignant air, so strong for them had been my feeling cry.;kirkpatrick
1;5;88-90;‘Our fellow being, gracious, kind and good! You, on your journeying through this bruised air, here visit two who tinged the world with blood.;kirkpatrick
1;5;91-93;Suppose the Sovereign of the Universe were still our friend, we’d pray He grant you peace. You pity so the ill perverting us.;kirkpatrick
1;5;94-96;Whatever you may please to hear or say, we, as we hear, we, as we speak, assent, so long – as now they do – these winds stay silent.;kirkpatrick
1;5;97-99;My native place is set along those shores through which the river Po comes down, to be at last at peace with all its tributaries.;kirkpatrick
1;5;100-102;Love, who so fast brings flame to generous hearts, seized him with feeling for the lovely form, now torn from me. The harm of how still rankles.;kirkpatrick
1;5;103-105;Love, who no loved one pardons love’s requite, seized me for him so strongly in delight that, as you see, he does not leave me yet.;kirkpatrick
1;5;106-108;Love drew us onwards to consuming death. Cain’s ice awaits the one who quenched our lives.’ These words, borne on to us from them, were theirs.;kirkpatrick
1;5;109-111;And when I heard these spirits in distress, I bowed my eyes and held them low, until, at length, the poet said: ‘What thoughts are these?’;kirkpatrick
1;5;112-114;I, answering in the end, began: ‘Alas, how many yearning thoughts, what great desire, have led them through such sorrow to their fate?’;kirkpatrick
1;5;115-117;And turning to them now I came to say: ‘Francesca, how your suffering saddens me! Sheer pity brings me to the point of tears.;kirkpatrick
1;5;118-120;But tell me this: the how of it – and why – that Love, in sweetness of such sighing hours, permitted you to know these doubtful pangs.’;kirkpatrick
1;5;121-123;To me she said: ‘There is no sorrow greater than, in times of misery, to hold at heart the memory of happiness. (Your teacher knows.);kirkpatrick
1;5;124-126;And yet, if you so deeply yearn to trace the root from which the love we share first sprang, then I shall say – and speak as though in tears.;kirkpatrick
1;5;127-129;One day we read together, for pure joy how Lancelot was taken in Love’s palm. We were alone. We knew no suspicion.;kirkpatrick
1;5;130-132;Time after time, the words we read would lift our eyes and drain all colour from our faces. A single point, however, vanquished us.;kirkpatrick
1;5;133-135;For when at last we read the longed-for smile of Guinevere – at last her lover kissed – he, who from me will never now depart,;kirkpatrick
1;5;136-138;touched his kiss, trembling to my open mouth. This book was Galehault – pander-penned, the pimp! That day we read no further down those lines.;kirkpatrick
1;5;139-141;And all the while, as one of them spoke on, the other wept, and I, in such great pity, fainted away as though I were to die.;kirkpatrick
1;5;142-142;And now I fell as bodies fall, for dead.;kirkpatrick
1;6;1-3;As I returned once more to conscious mind, closed in those feelings for the kindred souls, that had, in sudden sadness, overcome me.;kirkpatrick
1;6;4-6;Wherever I might turn I saw—wherever I might move, look around, or settle my gaze—new forms of torment, new tormented souls.;kirkpatrick
1;6;7-9;"I am in Circle Three. And rain falls there, endlessly, chill, accursed, and heavy; its rate and composition never new.";kirkpatrick
1;6;10-12;Snow, massive hailstones, black, tainted water, pour down in sheets through tenebrous air. The earth absorbs it all and stinks, revoltingly.;kirkpatrick
1;6;13-15;Cerberus, weird and monstrously cruel, barks from his triple throats in cur-like yowls, over the heads of those who lie there, drowned.;kirkpatrick
1;6;16-18;His eyes vermilion, beard a greasy black, his belly broad, his fingers all sharp-nailed, he mauls and skins, then hacks in four, these souls.;kirkpatrick
1;6;19-21;From all of them, rain wrings a wet-dog howl. They squirm, as flank screens flank. They twist, they turn, and then—these vile profanities—they turn again.;kirkpatrick
1;6;22-24;"That reptile Cerberus now glimpsed us there. He stretched his jaws; he showed us all his fangs. And me? No member in my frame stayed still!";kirkpatrick
1;6;25-27;My leader, bending with his palms wide-spanned, scooped dirt in each, and then—his fists both full—hurled these as sops down all three ravening throats.;kirkpatrick
1;6;28-30;A hungry mongrel—yapping, thrusting out, intent on nothing but the meal to come—is silent only when its teeth sink in.;kirkpatrick
1;6;31-33;In that same way, with three repulsive muzzles, the demon Cerberus. His thunderous growlings stunned these souls. They wished themselves stone deaf.;kirkpatrick
1;6;34-36;Over such shadows, flat in that hard rain, we traveled onwards still. Our tread now fell on voided nothings only seeming men.;kirkpatrick
1;6;37-39;Across the whole terrain these shades were spread, except that one, at seeing us pass by, sat, on the sudden, upright and then cried:;kirkpatrick
1;6;40-42;"""You there! Drawn onwards through this stretch of Hell, tell me you know me. Say so, if so you can. You! Made as man before myself unmade.""";kirkpatrick
1;6;43-45;"And I replied: ""The awful pain you feel perhaps has canceled you from memory. Till now, it seems, I’ve never even seen you.";kirkpatrick
1;6;46-48;"Then tell me who you are, and why you dwell in such a place? And why a pain like this? Others may well be worse, none so disgusting.""";kirkpatrick
1;6;49-51;"And he: ""That burgh of yours—that sack of bile that brims by now to overflow—I lived as hers throughout my own fine-weather years.";kirkpatrick
1;6;52-54;You knew me, like your city friends, as Hoggo. So here I am, condemned for gullet sins, lying, you see, squashed flat by battering rain.;kirkpatrick
1;6;55-57;"I’m not alone in misery of soul. These all lie subject to the selfsame pain. Their guilt is mine."" He spoke no further word.";kirkpatrick
1;6;58-60;"""Hoggo, your heavy labors,"" I replied, ""weigh on me hard and prompt my heavy tears. But tell me, if you can, where they’ll all end,";kirkpatrick
1;6;61-63;"the citizens of that divided town? Is there among them any honest man? Why is that place assailed by so much strife?""";kirkpatrick
1;6;64-66;"His answer was: ""From each side, long harangues. And then to blood. The Wildwood boys will drive the others out. They’ll do great harm.";kirkpatrick
1;6;67-69;But then, within the span of three brief suns, that side will fall and others rise and thrive, spurred on by one who now just coasts between.;kirkpatrick
1;6;70-72;For quite some time they’ll hold their heads up high and grind the others under heavy weights, however much, for shame, these weep and writhe.;kirkpatrick
1;6;73-75;"Of this lot, two are honest yet not heard. For pride and avarice and envy are the three fierce sparks that set all hearts ablaze.""";kirkpatrick
1;6;76-78;"With this, his tear-drenched song now reached an end. But I to him: ""I still want more instruction. This gift I ask of you: please do say more.";kirkpatrick
1;6;79-81;Tegghiaio, Farinata—men of rank—Mosca, Arrigo, Rusticucci too, and others with their minds on noble deeds,;kirkpatrick
1;6;82-84;"Tell me, so I may know them, where they are. For I am gripped by great desire to tell if Heaven holds them sweet—or poisonous Hell.""";kirkpatrick
1;6;85-87;"And he: ""These dwell among the blackest souls, loaded down deep by sins of differing types. If you sink far enough, you’ll see them all.";kirkpatrick
1;6;88-90;"But when you walk once more where life is sweet, bring me, I beg, to others in remembrance. No more I’ll say, nor answer any more.""";kirkpatrick
1;6;91-93;His forward gaze now twisted to a squint. He stared at me a little, bent his head, then fell face down and joined his fellow blind.;kirkpatrick
1;6;94-96;"My leader now addressed me: ""He’ll not stir until the trumpets of the angels sound, at which his enemy, True Power, will come.";kirkpatrick
1;6;97-99;"Then each will see once more his own sad tomb, and each, once more, assume its flesh and figure, each hear the rumbling thunder roll forever.""";kirkpatrick
1;6;100-102;So on we fared across that filthy blend of rain and shadow spirits, slow in step, touching a little on the life to come.;kirkpatrick
1;6;103-105;"Concerning which, ""These torments, sir,"" I said, ""when judgment has been finally proclaimed—will these increase or simmer just the same?""";kirkpatrick
1;6;106-108;"""Return,"" he said, ""to your first principles: when anything (these state) becomes more perfect, then all the more it feels both good and pain.";kirkpatrick
1;6;109-111;"Albeit these accursed men will not achieve perfection full and true, they still, beyond that Day, will come to sharper life.""";kirkpatrick
1;6;112-114;So, circling on the curve around that path, we talked of more than I shall here relate, but reached the brow, from which the route descends,;kirkpatrick
1;6;115-115;and found there Plutus, the tremendous foe.;kirkpatrick
1;7;1-3;"""Popoi Satan, popoi Satan! Alezorul!"" So Plutus – shrill voice clucking on – began. But Virgil, wise and noble, knowing all, ";kirkpatrick
1;7;4-6;"said, to comfort me: ""Let not your fears occasion you distress. Despite his powers, he cannot steal your right to scale this rock face."" ";kirkpatrick
1;7;7-9;"And then he turned to meet those rabid lips. ""Silence, you execrable wolf!"" he said. ""May fury gnaw you inwardly away. ";kirkpatrick
1;7;10-12;"To these dark depths, with every right he treads. All this is willed where Michael, in the heights, avenged the rapine wrought by prideful hordes."" ";kirkpatrick
1;7;13-15;As sails, inflated by a furious wind, fall in a tangle when the main mast snaps, so too he flopped, this predator, to ground. ;kirkpatrick
1;7;16-18;Then downwards to the seventh sink we went, advancing further down the curving wall, that bags up all the evil of the universe. ;kirkpatrick
1;7;19-21;God in all justice! I saw there so many new forms of travail, so tightly crammed. By whom?;kirkpatrick
1;7;22-24;How can our guilt so rend and ruin us? Over Charybdis, the sea surge swirls and shatters on the swell it clashes with.;kirkpatrick
1;7;25-27;So must these people dance their morisco. I saw, in numbers greater than elsewhere, two factions, hollering, this one to that, who rolled great boulders, thrust by rib and tit.;kirkpatrick
1;7;28-30;" Their stones would clash. Then wheeling they’d retreat and yell, across their shoulders, cry and counter-cry. ""You miser! Why?"" ""Why fling it all away?""";kirkpatrick
1;7;31-33; So back along that dismal curve they went, to reach, at either end, the diametric points, still screaming shamefully insulting chants. ;kirkpatrick
1;7;34-36;Arriving – each round his half-circle – back, each whisked around to tilt against the next other. At this – my heart transfixed, or very nearly – ;kirkpatrick
1;7;37-39;"""Sir,"" I spoke up, ""make clear to me what folk these are, and whether – to our left – all those with tonsured scalps could really have been clerics.""";kirkpatrick
1;7;40-42;" ""Without exception, all of these,"" he said, ""when first they lived, had such strabismic minds they’d bear no check or measure on expense.";kirkpatrick
1;7;43-45; And when they reach the two points in the round where converse crimes uncouple each from each, they bark their meaning out and sound it clear.;kirkpatrick
1;7;46-48;" Clerics they were – all those whose heads aren’t dressed with shaggy hair. All popes – or cardinals. In that lot, avarice displays its worst.""";kirkpatrick
1;7;49-51;" ""Well, sir,"" I said, ""in any group like this, I surely ought to recognize some few who bore in life the taint of this disease.""";kirkpatrick
1;7;52-54;" ""You seek,"" he said, ""to form an idle thought. The mindless lives that made them all so foul darken them now against all acts of mind. ";kirkpatrick
1;7;55-57;Both, to eternity, will buck and butt. These from their tombs will rise with fists tight shut, the others with their curly manes cropped short.;kirkpatrick
1;7;58-60; Their frenzied sprees or febrile hoardings-up have wrung from them the beauty of the world, and brought them firmly to this ugly brawl.;kirkpatrick
1;7;61-63; You now can see, dear son, the short-lived pranks that goods consigned to Fortune’s hand will play, causing such squabbles in the human ranks. ;kirkpatrick
1;7;64-66;"For all the gold that lies beneath the moon – or all that ever did lie there – would bring no respite to these worn-out souls, not one.""";kirkpatrick
1;7;67-69;" ""Please tell me, sir,"" I said, a little more, ""what can it be, this Fortune that you touch on, that clasps all earthly goods between its claws?""";kirkpatrick
1;7;70-72;" And he to me: ""You idiotic creatures, so greatly hurt by your own ignorance! Feed on my words. I’d have you grasp their sense.";kirkpatrick
1;7;73-75; He who transcends in wisdom all that is, wrought every sphere and gave to each a guide, so every part shines out to every part ;kirkpatrick
1;7;76-78;always in equal distribution of light. So, too, above the splendours of the world, He set a sovereign minister,;kirkpatrick
1;7;79-81; ordained to move in permutations at the proper time, vain goods from tribe to tribe, from blood to blood, in ways from which no human wisdom hides.;kirkpatrick
1;7;82-84; And this is why, where one race rules supreme, another faints and languishes: they all pursue her judgments, secret as a snake in grass.;kirkpatrick
1;7;85-87; Your powers of mind cannot contend with her. She, looking forwards, will pronounce her law, advancing, as do other gods, her own domain.;kirkpatrick
1;7;88-90; Her permutations never come to rest. It is necessity that makes her quick, so thick they come by turns to meet their fate.;kirkpatrick
1;7;91-93; She is the one so often crossed and cursed by those who, rightly, ought to sing her praise, yet vilify her name and speak her ill.;kirkpatrick
1;7;94-96; But she, a holy being, pays no heed. Happy, with all the other primal powers, she turns her sphere, rejoicing in beatitude.;kirkpatrick
1;7;97-99;" ""So let us now go down to greater pain. The stars that rose when I first stirred now fall. We cannot stay too long. That is forbidden."" ";kirkpatrick
1;7;100-102;Cutting across the circle, we approached the margins of a spring – which, seething, spilled and ran from there along an outer sluice.;kirkpatrick
1;7;103-105; The waters here were darker, far, than perse. So, on – accompanied by murky waves – downwards we travelled by a weirder route. ;kirkpatrick
1;7;106-108;Into a swamp (by name, the loathsome Styx) this melancholy brook makes way, and finds the foot of those malignant, grey-black slopes.;kirkpatrick
1;7;109-111; As there I stood, intent and wondering, I saw there, plunged within that stagnant fen, a peevish people, naked, caked with mud.;kirkpatrick
1;7;112-114; Each battered each – and not with fists alone, also with head butts, kicks and charging chests. Their teeth, too, tore them, bit by bit, to shreds.;kirkpatrick
1;7;115-117;" ""You witness now,"" my gentle teacher said, ""the souls of those whom anger overthrew. And this I’d also have you know:  be sure, ";kirkpatrick
1;7;118-120;beneath the surface of this slick are some whose sighs – as you can see at every turn – now aerate that pullulating film.;kirkpatrick
1;7;121-123;" So, stuck there fast in slime, they hum: ""Mournful we were. Sunlight rejoices the balmy air. We, though, within ourselves nursed sullen fumes,";kirkpatrick
1;7;124-126;" and come to misery in this black ooze."" That is the hymn each gurgles in his gorge, unable to articulate a single phrase.""";kirkpatrick
1;7;127-129; So, on around this sour, revolting pit, between the sludge and arid rock, we swung our arc, eyes bent on those who gulped that slop. ;kirkpatrick
1;7;130-130;We reached, in fine, the bottom of a tower.;kirkpatrick
1;8;1-3;And so I say (continuing) that, long before | We reached the bottom of that lofty tower, | Our eyes had travelled upwards to its summit,;kirkpatrick
1;8;4-6;Drawn by a pair of tiny flames, set there— | As now we saw—to signal to a third, | So far away the eye could hardly grasp it.;kirkpatrick
1;8;7-9;I turned towards the ocean of all wisdom: | ‘What do they mean?’ I said to him. ‘What answer | Does the farther fire now give? Who makes these signs?’;kirkpatrick
1;8;10-12;And he: ‘Across these waves of foaming mire, | You may already glimpse what they’ve been waiting for, | Unless it still goes hidden by these marshy fumes.’;kirkpatrick
1;8;13-15;No bow string ever shot through air an arrow | Rapider than now, at speed, I saw come on | Towards us there, a mean little vessel,;kirkpatrick
1;8;16-18;Within it—as pilot plying these waters— | A single galley man who strained the oar, | Squealing: ‘You fiend! You’ve got it coming now!’;kirkpatrick
1;8;19-21;‘Phlegyas, Phlegyas!’ my master said. | ‘Your screams and shouts have, this time, little point. | We’re yours—but only while we cross this marsh.’;kirkpatrick
1;8;22-24;Like someone hearing that a massive hoax | Has just, to his disgruntlement, been pulled on him, | So Phlegyas now stood, in pent-up rage.;kirkpatrick
1;8;25-27;My lord stepped down, and, entering the boat, | He made me, in my turn, embark behind. | The hull seemed laden only when I did.;kirkpatrick
1;8;28-30;At once—my leader boarded, me as well— | The ancient prow put out. It sawed the waves | More deeply than it would with other crews.;kirkpatrick
1;8;31-33;So, rushing forwards on that lifeless slick, | There jerked up, fronting me, one brimming slime who | Spoke: ‘So who—you come too soon!—are you?’;kirkpatrick
1;8;34-36;"And my riposte: ‘I come, perhaps; I’ll not remain. | But who might you be, brutishly befouled?’ | His answer was: ‘Just look at me. I’m one";kirkpatrick
1;8;37-39;Who weeps.’ And I to him: ‘Weep on. In grief, | May you remain, you spirit of damnation! | I know who you are, filth as you may be.’;kirkpatrick
1;8;40-42;And then he stretched both hands towards our gunwales. | My teacher, though—alert—soon drove him back, saying: | ‘Get down! Be off with all that dog pack!’;kirkpatrick
1;8;43-45;And then he ringed both arms around my neck. | He kissed my face, then said: ‘You wrathful soul! | Blessed the one that held you in her womb.;kirkpatrick
1;8;46-48;That man, alive, flaunted his arrogance, | And nothing good adorns his memory. | So here his shadow is possessed with rage.;kirkpatrick
1;8;49-51;How many, in the world above, pose there | As kings but here will lie like pigs in muck, | Leaving behind them horrible dispraise.’;kirkpatrick
1;8;52-54;‘Sir,’ I replied, ‘this I should really like: | Before we make our way beyond this lake, | To see him dabbled in the minestrone.’;kirkpatrick
1;8;55-57;He gave me my answer: ‘Before that shore | Has come to view, you’ll surely have your fill. | And rightly you rejoice in this desire.’;kirkpatrick
1;8;58-60;Then, moments on, I saw that sinner ripped | To vicious tatters by that mud-caked lot. | I praise God still, and still give thanks for that.;kirkpatrick
1;8;61-63;‘Get him,’ they howled. ‘Let’s get him—Silver Phil!’ | That crazy Florentine! He bucked, he baulked. | Turning, the Guelf turned teeth upon himself.;kirkpatrick
1;8;64-66;We left him there. Of him, my story tells no more. | And yet my ears were pierced with cries of pain. | At which, I barred my eyes intently forwards.;kirkpatrick
1;8;67-69;‘Dear son,’ my teacher in his goodness said, | ‘We now approach the city known as Dis, | Its teeming crowds and weighty citizens.’;kirkpatrick
1;8;70-72;‘Already, sir,’ I said, ‘I clearly can | Make out the minarets beyond this moat, | As bright and red, it seems, as if they sprang;kirkpatrick
1;8;73-75;From fire.’ ‘Eternal fire,’ he answered me, | ‘Burning within, projects, as you can see, | These glowing profiles from the depths of Hell.’;kirkpatrick
1;8;76-78;We now arrived within the deep-dug ditch— | The channel round that place disconsolate, | Whose walls, it seemed to me, were formed of iron.;kirkpatrick
1;8;79-81;Not without, first, encircling it about, | We came to where the ferry man broke forth: | ‘Out you all get!’ he yelled. ‘The entry’s here.’;kirkpatrick
1;8;82-84;I saw there, on that threshold—framed—more than | A thousand who had rained from Heaven. Spitting | In wrath. ‘Who’s that,’ they hissed, ‘who, yet undead,;kirkpatrick
1;8;85-87;Travels the kingdom of the truly dead?’ | He gave a sign, my teacher in all wisdom, | Saying he sought some secret word with them.;kirkpatrick
1;8;88-90;At which they somewhat hid their fierce disdain. | ‘You come, but on your own!’ they said. ‘Let him, so | Brazen entering our realm, walk by.;kirkpatrick
1;8;91-93;He may retrace his foolish path alone— | Or try it, if he can—while you’ll stay here. | You’ve been his escort through this dark terrain.’;kirkpatrick
1;8;94-96;Reader, imagine! I grew faint at heart, | To hear these cursed phrases ringing out. | I truly thought I’d never make it back.;kirkpatrick
1;8;97-99;‘My guide, my dearest master. Seven times— | Or more by now—you’ve brought me safely through. | You’ve drawn me from the face of towering doom.;kirkpatrick
1;8;100-102;Do not, I beg you, leave me here undone. | If we are now denied a clear way on, | Then let us quickly trace our footsteps back.’;kirkpatrick
1;8;103-105;My lord had led me onwards to that place— | And now he said: ‘Do not be terrified. | No one can take from us our right to pass.;kirkpatrick
1;8;106-108;Wait here a while. Refresh your weary soul. | Take strength. Be comforted. Feed on good hope. | I’ll not desert you in this nether world.’;kirkpatrick
1;8;109-111;So off he went. He there abandoned me, | My sweetest father. Plunged in ‘perhapses’, | I so remained, brain arguing ‘yes’ and ‘no’.;kirkpatrick
1;8;112-114;What he then said to them I could not tell. | Yet hardly had he taken up his stand | When all ran, jostling, to return inside.;kirkpatrick
1;8;115-117;They barred the door, these enemies of ours, | To meet his thrust. My lord remained shut out. | With heavy tread, he now came back to me.;kirkpatrick
1;8;118-120;Eyes bent upon the ground, his forehead shaved | Of all brave confidence, sighing, he said: | ‘Who dares deny me entrance to this house of grief?’;kirkpatrick
1;8;121-123;To me he said: ‘You see. I’m angry now. | Don’t be dismayed. They’ll fuss around in there. | They’ll seek to keep us out. But I’ll win through.;kirkpatrick
1;8;124-126;This insolence of theirs is nothing new. | At some less secret gate they tried it once. | But that still stands without its lock, ajar.;kirkpatrick
1;8;127-129;You’ve seen the door, dead words scribed on its beam. | And now already there descends the slope— | Passing these circles, and without a guide—;kirkpatrick
1;8;130-130;Someone through whom the city will lie open.’;kirkpatrick
1;9;1-3;The colour that courage failing brought out | So quickly in me, seeing my leader retreat, | Made him, the sooner, check his own new pallor.;kirkpatrick
1;9;4-6;Intently, as though listening hard, he stopped. | Eyesight unaided—in that blackened air, | Through foggy, dense swirls—could not carry far.;kirkpatrick
1;9;7-9;‘This contest, even so, we’re bound to win. | If not…’ he began. ‘Yet granted such a one… | How long to me it seems till that one comes!’;kirkpatrick
1;9;10-12;I saw quite clearly how he covered up | His opening thoughts with those that followed on— | Words inconsistent with the first he spoke.;kirkpatrick
1;9;13-15;Yet fear came over me at what he had said. | And so, from these truncated words, I drew | A meaning worse, perhaps, than he had meant.;kirkpatrick
1;9;16-18;‘Into the hollow deep of this grim bowl | Do any make their way from that first rung | Where nothing, save for thwarted hope, brings pain?’;kirkpatrick
1;9;19-21;I put this question to him. ‘Seldom,’ he said. | ‘It happens rarely that our people take | The path that I am venturing to tread.;kirkpatrick
1;9;22-24;It’s true, of course, I’ve been here once before, | Conjured to come by bitter Erichtho— | She who called shadows back into their limbs.;kirkpatrick
1;9;25-27;A short while only was I bare of flesh | Until, as she compelled, I breached these walls | To fetch a spirit from the Judas ring.;kirkpatrick
1;9;28-30;That is the utmost deep, the darkest place, | The furthest from the sky’s all-turning sphere. | I know the way. Be confident, be sure.;kirkpatrick
1;9;31-33;This marsh, exhaling such a nauseous stench, | Forms in a belt around the mournful town | And not without due anger shall we enter in.’;kirkpatrick
1;9;34-36;He said much more. But what I can’t recall. | My eyes in all attention now were drawn | Towards the blazing summit of that gate,;kirkpatrick
1;9;37-39;Where suddenly, at one point, there had sprung | Three blood-stained Furies from the depths of Hell. | In pose and body they were, all three, women,;kirkpatrick
1;9;40-42;Wound round about with water snakes, bright green. | Fringing their vicious brows they bore, as hair, | Entwining snakes. Their curls were sharp-horned vipers.;kirkpatrick
1;9;43-45;And he—who knew quite well that these were slaves | Who served the empress of unending tears— | Said to me: ‘Look! The cruel Eumenides!;kirkpatrick
1;9;46-48;That one’s Megaera, on the left-hand side. | Weeping there stands Alecto, on the right. | Tisiphone’s between these two.’ He paused.;kirkpatrick
1;9;49-51;Each rent her breast with her own fingernails. | With slapping palm, each beat herself and screamed— | So loud I strained, all doubt, against the poet.;kirkpatrick
1;9;52-54;‘Come now, Medusa! Turn him—quick!—to stone!’ | Staring hard down they spoke in unison. | ‘The Theseus raid went unavenged! We’re wrong!’;kirkpatrick
1;9;55-57;‘Turn round! Your back to them! Your eyes tight shut! | For if the Gorgon shows and you catch sight, | There’ll be no way of ever getting out.’;kirkpatrick
1;9;58-60;He spoke and then, himself, he made me turn | And, not relying on my hands alone, | To shield my eyes he closed his own on mine.;kirkpatrick
1;9;61-63;Look hard, all you whose minds are sound and sane, | And wonder at the meaning lying veiled | Beyond the curtain of this alien verse.;kirkpatrick
1;9;64-66;Already across the turbid swell there came | A shattering resonance that, charged with panic, | Evoked great tremors down each river bank.;kirkpatrick
1;9;67-69;In this way, too, a driving wind—impelled | By clashing currents through the burning air— | Strikes at a grove and, meeting no resistance,;kirkpatrick
1;9;70-72;Splinters the branches flat and bears them off. | So, proudly on it goes, in clouds of dust, | Shepherds and beasts all fleeing in its path.;kirkpatrick
1;9;73-75;He loosed my eyes, ‘And now,’ he said, ‘stretch straight | Your strings of sight across this age-old scum | To where the fumes are thickest, stinging most.’;kirkpatrick
1;9;76-78;Like frogs that glimpse their enemy the snake, | And vanish rapidly across the pond— | Diving till each sits huddling on its bed—;kirkpatrick
1;9;79-81;I saw a thousand ruined souls or more | Scattering in flight, ahead of one whose pace | Passed, yet kept dry, across the river Styx.;kirkpatrick
1;9;82-84;The greasy air he wafted from his face, | His left hand drawn before him, as a fan. | And this was all the strain, it seemed, that tired him.;kirkpatrick
1;9;85-87;I saw full well that he was sent from Heaven, | I turned towards my teacher, and he signed | That I should bend in silent deference.;kirkpatrick
1;9;88-90;How full he seemed to me of high disdain! | He reached the gates. And, simply with his rod, | He opened them. For nothing held them firm.;kirkpatrick
1;9;91-93;‘Outcasts from Heaven, driven beyond contempt!’ | Thus, in that dreadful doorway, he began: | ‘How is such truculence bred up in you?;kirkpatrick
1;9;94-96;Why so recalcitrant against that will | Whose aim and purpose never can be maimed, | Which has so often now increased your pain?;kirkpatrick
1;9;97-99;What is the point? Why kick against your fate? | Your guard dog Cerberus is still (remember?) | Hairless for doing so, at chin and neck.’;kirkpatrick
1;9;100-102;He then turned back along the filthy road. | He spoke no word to us. He had the look | Of someone gnawed and gathered up by care—;kirkpatrick
1;9;103-105;Though not the cares that here confronted him. | And now we set our tread towards that land. | The holy words had made us confident.;kirkpatrick
1;9;106-108;We entered. And no force was offered us. | So, eager to survey what such a fort | Could lock within the confines of its wall,;kirkpatrick
1;9;109-111;When once inside, I cast my eyes about. | I see a plain, extending all around. | And everywhere is grief and wracking pain.;kirkpatrick
1;9;112-114;Compare: at Arles (the Rhône there forms a marsh), | Or else at Pola by the Kvarner Gulf, | Which shuts the door on Italy and bathes its bounds,;kirkpatrick
1;9;115-117;Are sepulchres that make the ground uneven. | And so, too, here, a tomb at every turn, | Except that all was done more bitterly.;kirkpatrick
1;9;118-120;For flames were scattered round among these tombs. | The pits were therefore so intensely fired, | No tradesman needs his brand iron half so hot.;kirkpatrick
1;9;121-123;"The covers of the tombs all stood half-raised; | And out of each there came such cruel lamenting | These must have been the cries from pain within.";kirkpatrick
1;9;124-126;And I to my master: ‘Who can these all be, | These people buried in the sepulchres? | They make their presence felt in such pained sighs?’;kirkpatrick
1;9;127-129;The answer: ‘These are the master heretics, | With all their followers from every sect. | These tombs are filled with more than you suspect.;kirkpatrick
1;9;130-132;Those of like mind are buried each with each. | The monuments are all at differing heats.’ | He turned towards the right, then on we went,;kirkpatrick
1;9;133-133;Between the torments and high battlements.;kirkpatrick
1;10;1-3;Onward along a secret path—confined | Between those ramparts and the shows of pain— | My teacher led and I was at his shoulder.;kirkpatrick
1;10;4-6;‘You,’ I began, ‘true power and height of strength, | You bring me, turning, through these godless whirls. | Speak, if this pleases you. Feed my desires.;kirkpatrick
1;10;7-9;Those people lying in the sepulchres— | What chance is there of seeing them? The lids | Are off already. No one stands on guard.’;kirkpatrick
1;10;10-12;‘These tombs,’ he said, ‘will finally be shut | When, from Jehoshaphat on Judgment Day, | Sinners bring back their bodies left above.;kirkpatrick
1;10;13-15;This circle is the cemetery for all | Disciples of the Epicurus school, | Who say the body dies, so too the soul.;kirkpatrick
1;10;16-18;The question, therefore, that you’ve put to me, | Once you’re within, will soon be satisfied, | So, too, the longing that you keep unsaid.’;kirkpatrick
1;10;19-21;‘I never would—my lord, my trusted guide— | Keep, save for brevity, my heart from you. | And brevity you’ve urged on me before.’;kirkpatrick
1;10;22-24;‘Tuscan! You go through the city of fire | Alive and speaking as a man of worth. | Come, if you will, and rest in this domain.;kirkpatrick
1;10;25-27;Your accent manifests that you were born | A son of that great fatherland on which, | Perhaps, I wreaked too harsh an injury.’;kirkpatrick
1;10;28-30;This sound, so suddenly, came ringing out | From one among the sepulchres. Fearful, | I shrank still closer to my leader’s side.;kirkpatrick
1;10;31-33;‘What’s wrong?’ he said to me. ‘Just turn around! | And see there, upright, risen, Farinata. | From cincture upwards you will see him whole.’;kirkpatrick
1;10;34-36;My gaze was trained already into his, | While he, brow raised, was thrusting out his chest, | As though he held all Hell in high disdain.;kirkpatrick
1;10;37-39;My leader (hands in animated aid) | Drove me towards him down the line of vaults. | He counselled: ‘Let your words be duly measured.’;kirkpatrick
1;10;40-42;So there, beneath his sepulchre, I stood. | He looked me up and down a while, and then | Inquired, half-scornfully: ‘Who were your forebears?’;kirkpatrick
1;10;43-45;I—always eager and obedient— | Concealing nothing, laid all plainly forth. | At which he arched his brows a little more.;kirkpatrick
1;10;46-48;And then: ‘In fierce hostility, they stood | Against myself, my ancestors, my cause. | And so, on two occasions, they were scattered wide.’;kirkpatrick
1;10;49-51;‘Scattered,’ I answered, ‘so they may have been, | But all came back from all sides, then and now. | And your men truly never learned that art.’;kirkpatrick
1;10;52-54;Then there arose, revealed before my eyes, | A shadow near the first, seen from chin up, | Which had, as I suppose, just risen to its knees.;kirkpatrick
1;10;55-57;It looked me all around, as though intent | On seeing whether, with me, was another. | But when its doubting glance was wholly spent,;kirkpatrick
1;10;58-60;Weeping he called: ‘If you, through this eyeless | Prison, pass on through height of intellect, | My son, where is he? And why not here with you?’;kirkpatrick
1;10;61-63;‘I come,’ I said, ‘though not through my own strength. | The man who waits there leads me through this place | To one, perhaps, whom once your Guido scorned.’;kirkpatrick
1;10;64-66;The way he spoke—and what he suffered, too— | Had now already spelled for me his name. | And that was why my answer was so full.;kirkpatrick
1;10;67-69;Upright suddenly: ‘What’s that you say?’ | He wailed. “‘He once…”? You mean, he’s not alive? | And are his eyes not struck by bonny light?’;kirkpatrick
1;10;70-72;But then, in noticing that slight delay | Which came before I offered my reply, | He fell back flat, and did not re-appear.;kirkpatrick
1;10;73-75;The other noble soul (at whose command | I’d come to rest) in no way changed expression. | He neither moved his neck nor bent his waist.;kirkpatrick
1;10;76-78;But still continuing in what he’d said: | ‘If,’ he went on, ‘they learned that art so ill, | That is more torment than this bed of pain.;kirkpatrick
1;10;79-81;And yet no more than fifty times that face | (The moon’s, who is our sovereign here) will shine | Till you shall learn how heavy that art weighs.;kirkpatrick
1;10;82-84;If you once more would gain the lovely world, | Tell me: how dare those burghers, in their laws, | Oppose themselves so viciously to mine?’;kirkpatrick
1;10;85-87;My answer was: ‘The massacre, the mindless waste | That stained the flowing Arbia with blood, | Led, in our oratories, to these demands.’;kirkpatrick
1;10;88-90;Sighing, he did now move his head. ‘In none | Of that,’ he said, ‘was I alone. And I | Would not, without good cause, have gone with them.;kirkpatrick
1;10;91-93;I was alone—where all the rest could bear | To think that Florence might be swept away— | And boldly stood to speak in her defence.’;kirkpatrick
1;10;94-96;‘Well (may your seed find sometime true repose!) | Untie the knot for me,’ I now besought, | ‘So tightly twined around my searching thoughts.;kirkpatrick
1;10;97-99;You see, it seems (to judge from what I hear) | Far in advance what time will bring to pass, | But otherwise in terms of present things.’;kirkpatrick
1;10;100-102;‘We see like those who suffer from ill light. | We are,’ he said, ‘aware of distant things. | Thus far He shines in us, the Lord on high.;kirkpatrick
1;10;103-105;But when a thing draws near to us, our minds | Go blank. So if no other brings us news, | Then nothing of your human state is known to us.;kirkpatrick
1;10;106-108;You will from this be able to deduce | That all our knowledge will be wholly dead | When all the doors of future time are closed.’;kirkpatrick
1;10;109-111;And then I said, as though my heart were pierced | With guilt, ‘Go, say to him, that fallen soul, | His first-born son is still among the living.;kirkpatrick
1;10;112-114;And if, before I answered, I fell mute, | I did so (make him understand) because | My thoughts—which you have solved—had strayed to doubt.’;kirkpatrick
1;10;115-117;By now, my teacher had already called. | And so, with greater urgency I begged | That he should tell me who was with him there.;kirkpatrick
1;10;118-120;‘I lie,’ he answered, ‘with a thousand, more. | Enclosed beside me is the second Frederick. | Cardinal Octavian, too. Of others, I keep silent.’;kirkpatrick
1;10;121-123;And then he hid: and I, towards that great | Poet of the ancient world, turned my steps backwards, | Musing on words that seemed my enemy.;kirkpatrick
1;10;124-126;He went his way and, as he walked, he asked: | ‘Why is it you’re so lost in thought, so blurred by doubt?’ | And I responded fully to his words.;kirkpatrick
1;10;127-129;‘Keep well in mind,’ my lord in wisdom said, | ‘The things that you have heard against yourself. | But now,’ his finger raised, ‘attend to this:;kirkpatrick
1;10;130-132;When once again you stand within the rays | That she, whose lovely eyes see all things, casts, | You’ll learn from her what your life’s course will be.’;kirkpatrick
1;10;133-135;And then he swung, to tread towards the left. | We quit the wall and headed for the middle. The path we took cut straight into a gorge,;kirkpatrick
1;10;136-136;And even from above the stench was foul.;kirkpatrick
1;1;1-3;"In the middle of the journey of our life, I came to
myself in a dark wood, for the straight way was lost.";durling
1;1;4-6;"Ah, how hard a thing it is to say what that wood
was, so savage and harsh and strong that the
thought of it renews my fear!";durling
1;1;7-9;"It is so bitter that death is little more so! But to
treat of the good that I found there, I will tell of
the other things I saw.";durling
1;1;10-12;"I cannot really say how I entered there, so full of
sleep was I at the point when I abandoned the true
way.";durling
1;1;13-15;"But when I had reached the foot of a hill, where
the valley ended that had pierced my heart with fear,
";durling
1;1;16-18;"I looked on high and saw its shoulders clothed
already with the rays of the planet that leads us
straight on every path.";durling
1;1;19-21;"Then was the fear a little quieted that in the lake
of my heart had lasted through the night I passed
with so much anguish.";durling
1;1;22-24;"And like one with laboring breath, come forth out
of the deep onto the shore, who turns back to the
perilous water and stares:";durling
1;1;25-27;"so my spirit, still fleeing, turned back to gaze
again at the pass that has never yet left anyone alive.";durling
1;1;28-30;"After I had a little rested my weary body, I took
my way again along that deserted slope, so that my
halted foot was always the lower.";durling
1;1;31-33;"And behold, almost at the beginning of the steep,
a leopard, light and very swift, covered with spotted
fur;";durling
1;1;34-36;"and it did not depart from before my face but
rather so impeded my way that I was at several
turns turned to go back.";durling
1;1;37-39;"The time was the beginning of the morning, and
the sun was mounting up with those stars that were
with it when God’s love
";durling
1;1;40-42;"first set those lovely things in motion; so that I
took reason to have good hope of that beast with its
gaily painted hide";durling
1;1;43-45;"from the hour of the morning and the sweet
season; but not so that I did not fear the sight of a
lion that appeared to me.";durling
1;1;46-48;"He appeared to be coming against me with his
head high and with raging hunger, so that the air
appeared to tremble at him.";durling
1;1;49-51;"And a she-wolf, that seemed laden with all
cravings in her leanness and has caused many
peoples to live in wretchedness,";durling
1;1;52-54;"she put on me so much heaviness with the fear
that came from the sight of her, that I lost hope of
reaching the heights.";durling
1;1;55-57;"And like one who gladly acquires, and the time
arrives that makes him lose, who in all of his
thoughts weeps and becomes sad:";durling
1;1;58-60;"so she made me, that restless beast, who, coming
against me, little by little was driving me back to
where the sun is silent.";durling
1;1;61-63;"While I was falling down into a low place, before
my eyes one had offered himself to me who through
long silence seemed hoarse.";durling
1;1;64-66;"When I saw him in the great wilderness, “Miserere
on me,” I cried to him, “whatever you may be,
whether shade or true man!”";durling
1;1;67-69;"He replied: “Not a man, I was formerly a man,
and my parents were Lombards, Mantuans both by
birth.";durling
1;1;70-72;"I was born sub Iulio, though it was late, and I
lived in Rome under the good Augustus in the time
of the false and lying gods.";durling
1;1;73-75;"I was a poet, and I sang of that just son of
Anchises who came from Troy, when proud Ilion
was destroyed by fire.";durling
1;1;76-78;"But you, why do you return to so much suffering?
why do you not climb the delightful mountain that is
origin and cause of all joy?”";durling
1;1;79-81;"“Now are you that Virgil, that fountain which
spreads forth so broad a river of speech?” I replied
with shamefast brow.";durling
1;1;82-84;"“O honor and light of the other poets, let my long
study and great love avail me, that has caused me to
search through your volume.";durling
1;1;85-87;"You are my master and my author, you alone are
he from whom I have taken the pleasing style that
has won me honor.";durling
1;1;88-90;"See the beast for which I have turned back: help
me against her, famous sage, for she makes my veins
and pulses tremble.”";durling
1;1;91-93;"“You must hold to another path,” he replied, after
he saw me weep, “if you wish to escape from this
savage place;";durling
1;1;94-96;"for this beast at which you cry out lets no one
pass by her way, but so much impedes him that she
kills him;";durling
1;1;97-99;"and she has a nature so evil and cruel that her
greedy desire is never satisfied, and after feeding she
is hungrier than before.";durling
1;1;100-102;"Many are the animals with whom she mates, and
there will be more still, until the greyhound shall
come, who will make her die in pain.";durling
1;1;103-105;"He will feed on neither earth nor pelf, but on
wisdom, love, and power, and his birth will be
between felt and felt.";durling
1;1;106-108;"He will be the salvation of that humble Italy for
which the virgin Camilla died of her wounds, and
Euryalus, Turnus, and Nisus.";durling
1;1;109-111;"He will drive her from every town until he has
put her back in Hell, whence envy first sent her
forth.";durling
1;1;112-114;"Thus for your good I think and judge that you
shall follow me, and I shall be your guide, and I will
lead you from here through an eternal place,";durling
1;1;115-117;"where you will hear the desperate shrieks, you
will see the ancient suffering spirits, who all cry out
at the second death;";durling
1;1;118-120;"and you will see those who are content in the fire,
because they hope to come, whenever it may be, to
the blessed people.";durling
1;1;121-123;"To whom then if you shall wish to rise, there will
be a soul more worthy of that than I; with her I shall
leave you when I depart;";durling
1;1;124-126;"for that Emperor who reigns on high, because I
was a rebel to his law, wills not that I come into his
city.";durling
1;1;127-129;"In every place he commands, and there he rules;
there is his city and high throne: O happy the one he
chooses to be there!”";durling
1;1;130-132;"And I to him: “Poet, I beg you by that God whom
you did not know, so that I may flee this evil and
worse,";durling
1;1;133-135;"that you lead me where you have just now said,
so that I may see the gate of Saint Peter and those
whom you call so woebegone.”";durling
1;1;136-136;Then he moved, and I followed after him.;durling
1;2;1-3;"The day was departing, and the darkened air was | releasing all living creatures on the earth from their toils; | and I alone";durling
1;2;4-6;prepared myself to undergo the war both of the | journey and of pity, which memory, unerring, | will depict.;durling
1;2;7-9;"O muses, O high wit, now help me; O memory | that wrote down what I saw, here will your | nobility appear.";durling
1;2;10-12;I began: “Poet who are my guide, consider my | strength, if it is powerful enough, before you | entrust me to the deep pass.;durling
1;2;13-15;You say that the father of Silvius, still in | corruptible flesh, went to the immortal realm | and was there with his senses.;durling
1;2;16-18;Therefore, if the adversary of all evil was liberal | to him, considering the high effect that was to | come forth from him, and who and what he was,;durling
1;2;19-21;"it does not seem unworthy to a man of intellect;
for he in the Empyrean heaven had been chosen to
be father of mother Rome and her empire:";durling
1;2;22-24;And rome and her empire, to tell the truth, were | established to be the holy place where the successor | of great Peter is enthroned.;durling
1;2;25-27;Through this journey that you claim for him, he | understood things that were the cause of his | victory and of the papal mantle.;durling
1;2;28-30;Later the chosen Vessel went there, to bring | back strengthening for that faith which is the | beginning of the way of salvation.;durling
1;2;31-33;"But I, why come there? or who grants it? I am | not Aeneas, I am not Paul; neither I nor others | believe me worthy of that.";durling
1;2;34-36;Therefore, if I abandon myself to the journey, | I fear lest my coming may be folly. You are wise, | you understand better than I speak.”;durling
1;2;37-39;And like one who unwills what he just now | willed and with new thoughts changes his intent, | so that he draws back entirely from beginning:;durling
1;2;40-42;so did I become on that dark slope, for, thinking, | I gave up the undertaking that I had been so | quick to begin.;durling
1;2;43-45;“If I have well understood your word,” replied | the shade of that great-souled one, “your soul | is wounded by cowardice,;durling
1;2;46-48;which many times so encumbers a man that he | turns back from honorable endeavor, as a false | sight turns a beast when it shies.;durling
1;2;49-51;That you may free yourself from this fear, I will | tell you why I came and what I heard in the | first moment when I grieved for you.;durling
1;2;52-54;I was among those who are suspended, and a | lady called me, so blessed and beautiful that I | begged her to command me.;durling
1;2;55-57;"Her eyes were shining brighter than the | morning star; and she began to speak gently and | softly, with angelic voice, in her language:";durling
1;2;58-60;‘O courteous Mantuan soul, whose fame still | lasts in the world and will last as far as the | world will go,;durling
1;2;61-63;"my friend, not the friend of fortune, on the | deserted shore is so blocked in his journey | that he has turned back for fear;";durling
1;2;64-66;and I am afraid that he may be already so lost | that I have risen too late to help him, according | to what I have heard of him in Heaven.;durling
1;2;67-69;Now go, and with your ornamented speech and | whatever else is needed for his escape help | him so that I may be consoled.;durling
1;2;70-72;I am Beatrice who cause you to go  I come from | the place where I long to return love has | moved me and makes me speak.;durling
1;2;73-75;When I shall be before my lord, I will praise | you frequently to him.’ Then she was silent, | and I began:;durling
1;2;76-78;‘O lady of power, through whom alone the | human race rises above all the contents of that | heaven whose circles are smallest,;durling
1;2;79-81;"so pleasing to me is your command that obeying, | had it already taken place, is slow; no more | is needed than to unfold your desire.";durling
1;2;82-84;But tell me the reason why you do not shrink | from coming down here, into this center, from | the spacious place where you desire to return.’;durling
1;2;85-87;‘Since you wish to know so deeply, I will tell | you in brief,’ she replied, ‘why I do not fear | to come inside here.;durling
1;2;88-90;"One must fear only those things that have the | power to harm; not other things, for they are | not fearful.";durling
1;2;91-93;I am made by God, in his mercy, such that | your misery does not touch me, the flame of | this burning does not assail me.;durling
1;2;94-96;There is a noble lady in Heaven, who grieves | for this impediment to which I send you, so that | she vanquishes harsh judgment there on high.;durling
1;2;97-99;She called Lucia in her request and said: | —Now your faithful one has need of you, and I | put him in your hands.—;durling
1;2;100-102;Lucia, enemy of all cruelty, moved and came | to the place where I was sitting with the | ancient Rachel.;durling
1;2;103-105;She said:—Beatrice, true praise of God, why do | you not help him who loved you so, who because | of you came forth from the common herd?;durling
1;2;106-108;Do you not hear the anguish of his weeping, do | you not see the death that attacks him there, by | the torrent where the sea has no boast?—;durling
1;2;109-111;In the world there have never been persons so | swift to seek their advantage or to flee their | loss, as I, after hearing such words spoken, ;durling
1;2;112-114;came down | here from my blessed throne, trusting in your | virtuous speech, which honors you and those who have heeded it.’ |;durling
1;2;115-117;After she had spoken all this to me, she turned | her shining eyes, shedding tears, which made me quicker to come here.;durling
1;2;118-120;And I | have come to you as she willed: from before that | beast I have taken you, that deprived you of the short path up the | mountain. ;durling
1;2;121-123;Therefore what is it? why, why do | you stand still? why do you nurse such cowardice in your | heart? why do you not have boldness and | freedom,;durling
1;2;124-126;seeing that three such blessed ladies have a care | for you in the court of Heaven, and my speech | promises you so much good?”;durling
1;2;127-129;As little flowers, bowed and closed in the chill | of night, when the sun whitens them straighten | up all open on their stems:;durling
1;2;130-132;so did I become with my tired strength, and so | much good boldness ran to my heart, that I | began like a person freed:;durling
1;2;133-135;“Oh full of pity she who has helped me! and you | courteous, who have quickly obeyed the true | words she offered you!;durling
1;2;136-138;Your words have so filled my heart with desire | to come with you, that I have returned to my | first purpose.;durling
1;2;139-141;"Now go, for one same will is in both: you are | leader, you lord, and you master.” So I said | to him; and when he had set forth";durling
1;2;142-142;I entered upon the deep, savage journey.;durling
1;3;1-3;Through me the way into the grieving city, through me the way into eternal sorrow, through me the way among the lost people.;durling
1;3;4-6;"Justice moved my high maker; divine power made me, highest wisdom, and primal love.";durling
1;3;7-9;Before me were no things created except eternal ones, and I endure eternal. Abandon every hope, you who enter.;durling
1;3;10-12;These words I saw written with dark color above a gate, and I said: “Master, their sense is hard for me.”;durling
1;3;13-15;And he to me, like one alert: “Here one must abandon every suspicion, every cowardice must die here.;durling
1;3;16-18;We have come to the place where I told you, you will see the grieving peoples who have lost the good of the intellect.”;durling
1;3;19-21;And, putting his hand on mine with a cheerful glance from which I drew strength, he introduced me into the secret things.;durling
1;3;22-24;There sighs, weeping, loud wailing resounded through the starless air, for which at the outset I shed tears.;durling
1;3;25-27;Strange languages, horrible tongues, words of pain, accents of anger, voices loud and hoarse, and sounds of blows with them.;durling
1;3;28-30;Made a tumult that turns forever in that air darkened without time, like the sand when a whirlwind blows.;durling
1;3;31-33;And I, my head girt with horror, said: “Master, what is this I hear? and what people is this who seem so overcome by grief?”;durling
1;3;34-36;And he to me: “This wretched measure is kept by the miserable souls who lived without infamy and without praise.”;durling
1;3;37-39;They are mixed with that cowardly chorus of angels who were not rebels yet were not faithful to God, but were for themselves.;durling
1;3;40-42;The heavens reject them so as not to be less beautiful, nor does deep Hell receive them, for the wicked would have some glory from them.;durling
1;3;43-45;And I: “Master, what is so grievous that it makes them lament so loudly?” He replied: “I will tell you very briefly.”;durling
1;3;46-48;They have no hope of death, and their blind life is so base that they are envious of every other fate.;durling
1;3;49-51;"The world permits no fame of them to exist; mercy and justice alike disdain them: let us not speak of them, but look and pass on.";durling
1;3;52-54;When I looked again, I saw a flag running in circles so rapidly that it seemed to scorn all pause.;durling
1;3;55-57;And after it there came so long a train of people, that I would not have believed death had undone so many.;durling
1;3;58-60;After I had recognized several, I saw and knew the shade of him who in his cowardice made the great refusal.;durling
1;3;61-63;Immediately I understood and was certain that this was the sect of cowards, displeasing both to God and to his enemies.;durling
1;3;64-66;These wretches, who never were alive, were naked and much tormented by large flies and wasps that were there.;durling
1;3;67-69;These streaked their faces with blood which, mixed with tears, at their feet was gathered up by disgusting worms.;durling
1;3;70-72;"And when I gazed beyond them, I saw people on the bank of a great river; so I said, “Master, now grant.”";durling
1;3;73-75;That I may know who those are, and what disposition makes them seem so ready to cross over, as I can discern in spite of the weak light.;durling
1;3;76-78;And he to me: “These things will be made known to you when we stay our steps on the gloomy shore of Acheron.”;durling
1;3;79-81;Then with eyes shamefast and cast down, afraid that my speaking might displease him, I refrained from speech until we reached the river.;durling
1;3;82-84;And behold coming toward us in a boat an old man, white with the hairs of age, crying: “Woe to you, wicked souls!;durling
1;3;85-87;Never hope to see the sky: I come to lead you to the other shore, to the eternal shadows, to heat and freezing.;durling
1;3;88-90;And you who are over there, living soul, separate yourself from these here, who are dead.” But when he saw that I did not leave.;durling
1;3;91-93;He said: “By another way, through other ports will you come to shore, not by crossing here: a lighter vessel must carry you.”;durling
1;3;94-96;And my leader to him: “Charon, do not torture yourself with anger: this is willed where what is willed can be done, so ask no more.”;durling
1;3;97-99;Then were quiet the woolly jowls of the pilot of the livid swamp  around his eyes he had wheels of flame.;durling
1;3;100-102;But those weary, naked souls changed color and gnashed their teeth, as soon as they heard his harsh words.;durling
1;3;103-105;They cursed God and their parents, the human race and the place and the time and the seed of their sowing and of their birth.;durling
1;3;106-108;Then all of them together, weeping loudly, drew near the evil shore that awaits each one who does not fear God.;durling
1;3;109-111;"Charon the demon, with eyes like glowing coals, making signs to them, gathers them all in; he beats with his oar whoever lingers.";durling
1;3;112-114;As in autumn the leaves remove themselves one after the other, until the branch sees all its raiment on the ground.;durling
1;3;115-117;So the evil seed of Adam throw themselves from that shore one by one, when beckoned to, each like a falcon to its lure.;durling
1;3;118-120;Thus they go off across the dark waves, and before they have disembarked over there, over here again a new flock gathers.;durling
1;3;121-123;“My son,” said my courteous master, “those who die in God’s anger all come together here from every land.;durling
1;3;124-126;And they are ready to cross over the river, for God’s justice so spurs them that fear turns to desire.”;durling
1;3;127-129;"No good soul ever passes this way; and so, if Charon complains of you, you can well understand what his words mean.";durling
1;3;130-132;As he finished, the dark landscape trembled so violently that in terror my memory bathes me again with sweat.;durling
1;3;133-135;The tearful earth gave forth a wind that flashed with a crimson light which overcame all feeling in me, ;durling
1;3;136-136;and I fell like one whom sleep is taking.;durling
1;4;1-3;"Breaking the deep sleep within my head, a heavy  thunder-clap made me shake myself like one forcibly  awakened; ";durling
1;4;4-6; and I turned my rested eye about, standing erect,  and gazed fixedly, to know the place where I might  be.;durling
1;4;7-9;In truth, I found myself on the brink of the  sorrowful valley of the abyss, which gathers in the  thundering of infinite woes.  ;durling
1;4;10-12;Dark and deep it was, and so clouded that though  I probed with my sight to the bottom I discerned  nothing there. ;durling
1;4;13-15; “Now let us descend down here into the blind  world,” began the poet, all pale. “I will be first, and  you will be second.”  ;durling
1;4;16-18; And I, who had perceived his color, said: “How  can I come, if you are afraid, who when I have fears  have ever brought me strength?”  ;durling
1;4;19-21;And he to me: “The suffering of the peoples who  are here below, paints on my face that pity which  you perceive as fear. ;durling
1;4;22-24; Let us go, for the long way urges us.” So he put  himself, and so he made me enter, into the first circle  girding the abyss.;durling
1;4;25-27;Here, as far as could be heard, there was no  weeping except of sighs which caused the eternal air  to tremble;durling
1;4;28-30;these resulted from grief without torture, felt by  the crowds, which were many and large, of infants  and of women and of men. ;durling
1;4;31-33; My good master to me: “You do not ask what  spirits are these you see? Now I wish you to know, before you walk further, ;durling
1;4;34-36;"  that they did not sin; and if they have merits, it is  not enough, because they did not receive baptism,  which is the gateway to the faith that you believe.  ";durling
1;4;37-39;And if they lived before Christianity, they did not  adore God as was needful: and of this kind am I  myself. ;durling
1;4;40-42; Because of such defects, not for any other  wickedness, we are lost, and only so far harmed that  without hope we live in desire.”;durling
1;4;43-45;Great sorrow seized my heart when I understood  him, because I knew that people of great worth were  suspended in that limbo.  ;durling
1;4;46-48;“Tell me, my master, tell me, lord,” I began,  wishing to be assured of that faith which overcomes  all error: ;durling
1;4;49-51; “has anyone ever gone forth from here, either  through his own merit or through another, so as to  become blessed?” And he, who understood my  veiled speech,  ;durling
1;4;52-54;replied: “I was still new in this condition, when I  saw a powerful one come, crowned with a sign of  victory. ;durling
1;4;55-57; He led forth from here the shade of our first  parent, of Abel his son, and that of Noah, of Moses,  lawgiver and obedient,  ;durling
1;4;58-60; Abraham the patriarch and David the king, Israel  with his father, and his children, and Rachel, for  whom he did so much,  ;durling
1;4;61-63;and many others, and he made them blessed.  And I would have you know that before them no  human spirits were saved.” ;durling
1;4;64-66; We did not cease walking because he spoke, but  kept on passing through the wood, the wood, I say, of crowding spirits. ;durling
1;4;67-69;  Our way had not led far from where I had slept, when I saw a fire that overcame a hemisphere of  shadows.  ;durling
1;4;70-72;We were still some distance from it, but not so far  as to keep me from discerning in part that people worthy  to be honored possessed that place. ;durling
1;4;73-75; “O you who honor knowledge and art, who are  these who receive so much privilege as to be separated from the manner of the others?”  ;durling
1;4;76-78; And he to me: “The honor with which their names resound up in your life, wins grace in Heaven that  thus advances them.”  ;durling
1;4;79-81;Meantime a voice was heard by me: “Honor the  highest poet: his shade returns, that had departed.”  ;durling
1;4;82-84;When the voice had ceased and was silent, I saw  four great shades coming toward us: their expression  was neither sad nor happy. ;durling
1;4;85-87; My good master began to speak: “Behold the one  with that sword in his hand, coming in front of the other three as if their lord: ;durling
1;4;88-90;"that is Homer, the supreme poet; the next is Horace the satirist; Ovid is the third, and the last,  Lucan.  ";durling
1;4;91-93;Because they all share with me that name which  the single voice pronounced, they do me honor, and  in this they do well.” ;durling
1;4;94-96; So saw I come together the lovely school of that  lord of highest song, who soars above the others like an eagle.  ;durling
1;4;97-99;" When they had spoken together for a time they turned to me with sign of greeting, and my master  smiled at that;  ";durling
1;4;100-102;and they did me an even greater honor, for they  made me one of their band, so that I was sixth  among so much wisdom. ;durling
1;4;103-105; Thus we went as far as the light, speaking things  of which it is good to be silent now, as it was good to speak them there where I was.;durling
1;4;106-108;We came to the foot of a noble castle, seven times encircled by high walls, defended all around by a  lovely little stream.  ;durling
1;4;109-111;This we passed over like solid ground  through  seven gates I entered with these sages  we came into  a meadow of fresh green. ;durling
1;4;112-114; Here were people with slow, grave eyes and great  authority in their countenances: they spoke seldom, and with soft voices.   ;durling
1;4;115-117;Therefore we drew to one side, to a place open, bright, and high, whence all of them could be seen. ;durling
1;4;118-120;  There opposite, on the bright green grass, all the great spirits were shown to me, so that I am still  exalted within myself at the sight.  ;durling
1;4;121-123;I saw Electra with many companions, among  whom I recognized Hector and Aeneas, Caesar in  armor with hawklike eyes. ;durling
1;4;124-126;" I saw Camilla and Penthesilea; on the other side I  saw King Latinus, who was sitting with Lavinia his daughter.   ";durling
1;4;127-129;"I saw the Brutus who drove Tarquin out, Lucretia, Julia, Marcia, and Cornelia; and alone, to the side,  Saladdin.  ";durling
1;4;130-132;When I lifted my brow a little higher, I saw the  master of those who know, sitting among a  philosophical company. ;durling
1;4;133-135;" All gaze at him, all do him honor: there I saw  Socrates and Plato, standing closer to him, in front of the others,  
";durling
1;4;136-138;" Democritus, who assigns the world to chance, Diogenes, Anaxagoras, and Thales, Empedocles,  Heraclitus, and Zeno;  ";durling
1;4;139-141;"and I saw Dioscorides; and I saw Orpheus, Tullius and  Linus, and Seneca the moralist, ";durling
1;4;142-144;Euclid the geometer  and Ptolemy, Hippocrates, Avicenna and Galen,  Averroés who made the great commentary.  ;durling
1;4;145-147;I cannot describe them all in full, because my long theme so drives me that often the word falls short of the fact.;durling
1;4;148-150; The company of six is reduced to two: along another way my wise leader conducts me out of the  quiet, into the trembling air.  ;durling
1;4;151-151;And I came to a place where nothing gives light.;durling
1;5;1-3;Thus I descended from the first circle down to the second, which encloses a smaller space, but so much more suffering that it goads the souls to shriek.;durling
1;5;4-6;"There stands Minos bristling and snarling: he examines the soul’s guilt at the entrance; he judges and passes sentence by how he wraps.";durling
1;5;7-9;"I say that when the ill-born soul comes before him, it confesses all; and that connoisseur of sin sees ";durling
1;5;10-12;which is its place in Hell. He girds himself with his tail as many times as the levels he wills the soul to be sent down. ;durling
1;5;13-15;"Always many stand before him; each goes in turn to judgment. They speak and hear and are cast into the deep. ";durling
1;5;16-18;“O you who come to the dolorous hospice,” said Minos when he saw me, leaving off the exercise of his great office.;durling
1;5;19-21;“Beware how you enter and to whom you entrust yourself: be not deceived by the spacious entrance!” And my leader to him: “Why still cry out?;durling
1;5;22-24;Do not impede his going, which is decreed: this is willed where what is willed can be done, so ask no more.;durling
1;5;25-27;” Now the grief-stricken notes begin to make themselves heard.;durling
1;5;28-30;Now I have come where much weeping assails me. I came into a place where all light is silent, that groans like the sea in a storm.;durling
1;5;31-33;"When it is lashed by conflicting winds, the infernal whirlwind, which never rests, drives the spirits before its violence; turning and striking, it tortures them.";durling
1;5;34-36;"When they come before the landslide, there the shrieks, the wailing, the lamenting; there they curse God’s power. ";durling
1;5;37-39;I understood that to this torment were damned the carnal sinners. They who subject their reason to their lust. ;durling
1;5;40-42;And as their wings carry off the starlings in the cold season, in large full flocks, so does that breath carry the evil spirits.;durling
1;5;43-45;"Here, there, down, up; no hope ever comforts them, not of lessened suffering, much less of rest. ";durling
1;5;46-48;And as the cranes go singing their lays, making a long line of themselves in the air.;durling
1;5;49-51;"So I saw coming toward us, uttering cries, shades borne by the aforesaid violence; so I said: “Master, who are those people whom the black wind so chastises?”";durling
1;5;52-54;“The first of those about whom you wish to learn,” he said to me then, “was empress over many languages. So broken was she to the vice of lust.;durling
1;5;55-57;That in her laws she made licit whatever pleased, to lift from herself the blame she had incurred. ;durling
1;5;58-60;She is Semiramis, of whom we read that she succeeded Ninus and was his wife. She ruled the lands the Sultan governs now.;durling
1;5;61-63;" The next is she who killed herself for love and broke faith with the ashes of Sichaeus; next is lustful Cleopatra.";durling
1;5;64-66;Behold Helen, who brought such evil times, and see the great Achilles, who battled against Love at the end. ;durling
1;5;67-69;Behold Paris, Tristan. And more than a thousand shades he showed me, and named them, pointing, whom Love parted from our life.;durling
1;5;70-72;After I had heard my teacher name the ancient ladies and knights, pity came upon me, and I was almost lost.;durling
1;5;73-75;I began: “Poet, gladly would I speak with those two who go together and seem to be so light upon the wind.”;durling
1;5;76-78;"And he to me: “You will see when they are closer to us; and then beg them by the love that drives them, and they will come.”";durling
1;5;79-81;As soon as the wind bends them toward us, I sent forth my voice: “O wearied souls, come speak with us, if another does not forbid it!”;durling
1;5;82-84;As doves, called by their desire, with wings raised and steady come to their sweet nest through the air, borne by their will.;durling
1;5;85-87;So did they emerge from the flock where Dido is, coming to us through the cruel air, so compelling was my deepfelt cry.;durling
1;5;88-90;“O gracious and benign living creature who through the black air go visiting us who stained the world blood-red.;durling
1;5;91-93;If the king of the universe were friendly we would pray to him for your peace, since you have pity on our twisted pain.;durling
1;5;94-96;Of whatever it pleases you to hear and to speak we will listen and speak to you, while the wind is quiet for us, as it is now.;durling
1;5;97-99;The city where I was born sits beside the shore where the Po descends to have peace with its followers.;durling
1;5;100-102;"Love, which is swiftly kindled in the noble heart, seized this one for the lovely person that was taken from me; and the manner still injures me.";durling
1;5;103-105;Love, which pardons no one loved from loving in return, seized me for his beauty so strongly that, as you see, it still does not abandon me.;durling
1;5;106-108;Love led us on to one death. Caina awaits him who extinguished our life.” These words were borne from them to us.;durling
1;5;109-111;When I understood those injured souls, I bent my face downward, and I held it down so long that the poet said: “What are you pondering?”;durling
1;5;112-114;When I replied, I began: “Alas, how many sweet thoughts, how much yearning led them to the grievous pass!”;durling
1;5;115-117;Then I turned back to them and spoke, and I began: “Francesca, your sufferings make me sad and piteous to tears.;durling
1;5;118-120;But tell me: in the time of your sweet sighs, by what and how did Love grant you to know your dangerous desires?”;durling
1;5;121-123;"And she to me: “There is no greater pain than to remember the happy time in wretchedness; and this your teacher knows.";durling
1;5;124-126;But if you have so much desire to know the first root of our love, I will do as one who weeps and speaks.;durling
1;5;127-129;"We were reading one day, for pleasure, of Lancelot, how Love beset him; we were alone and without any suspicion.";durling
1;5;130-132;"Many times that reading drove our eyes together and turned our faces pale; but one point alone was the one that overpowered us.";durling
1;5;133-135;When we read that the yearned-for smile was kissed by so great a lover, he, who will never be separated from me.;durling
1;5;136-138;Kissed my mouth all trembling. Galeotto was the book and he who wrote it: that day we read there no further.;durling
1;5;139-141;While one spirit said this, the other was weeping so that for pity I fainted as if I were dying, ;durling
1;5;142-142;and I fell as a dead body falls.;durling
1;6;1-3;When consciousness returned, after closing itself | before the pity of those two in-laws, | which utterly confounded me with sadness.;durling
1;6;4-6;New torments and new tormented ones I see | around me wherever I walk, | and wherever I turn, and wherever I look.;durling
1;6;7-9;"I am in the third circle, with the eternal, | cursed, cold, and heavy rain; | its rule and quality never change.";durling
1;6;10-12;"Great hailstones, filthy water, and snow | pour down through the dark air; | the earth stinks that receives them.";durling
1;6;13-15;Cerberus, cruel, monstrous beast, | with three throats barks doglike | over the people submerged there.;durling
1;6;16-18;"His eyes are red, his beard greasy and black, | his belly large, and his hands have talons; | he claws the spirits, flays and quarters them.";durling
1;6;19-21;"The rain makes them howl like dogs; | they make a shield for one of their sides | with the other; cast-out wretches, they turn over frequently.";durling
1;6;22-24;"When Cerberus, the great worm, caught sight of us, | he opened his mouths and showed his fangs; | not one of his members held still.";durling
1;6;25-27;And my leader opened his hands, | took up earth, and with both fists full | threw it into those ravenous pipes.;durling
1;6;28-30;Like a dog that baying hungers | and is silent once he bites his food, | for he looks and struggles only to devour it,;durling
1;6;31-33;so became those filthy snouts | of the demon Cerberus, who thunders | over the souls so that they wish they were deaf.;durling
1;6;34-36;We were passing through the shades | that the heavy rain weighs down, | and we were placing our soles on their emptiness.;durling
1;6;37-39;They were lying on the ground, all of them, | save one, who raised himself to sit | as soon as he saw us passing before him.;durling
1;6;40-42;“O you who are led through this Hell,” | he said to me, “recognize me if you can: | you were made before I was unmade.”;durling
1;6;43-45;And I to him: “The anguish that you have | perhaps drives you from my memory, | so that it does not seem I have ever seen you.;durling
1;6;46-48;But tell me who you are, | who are put here in so painful a place, | and have such a punishment that if any is greater, none is so disgusting.”;durling
1;6;49-51;And he to me: “Your city, which is so full of envy | that the sack already overflows, | kept me with her during my sunny life.;durling
1;6;52-54;"You citizens called me Ciacco; | because of the damnable sin of the gullet, | as you see, I am broken by the rain.";durling
1;6;55-57;And I, wretched soul, am not alone, | for all these endure similar punishment | for similar guilt.” And he spoke no further word.;durling
1;6;58-60;"I replied: “Ciacco, your trouble weighs on me | so that it calls me to weep; | but tell me, if you know, to what will come.";durling
1;6;61-63;"The citizens of the divided city; | if any there is just; | and tell me the reason so much discord has assailed it.”";durling
1;6;64-66;And he to me: “After much quarreling | they will come to blood, and the party from the woods | will drive out the other with much harm.;durling
1;6;67-69;Then later this party must fall | within three suns and the other rise, | with the power of one who now hugs the shore.;durling
1;6;70-72;Long will they hold high their brows, | keeping the others down under heavy weights, | no matter how they weep or are shamed.;durling
1;6;73-75;"Two are just, and no one heeds them; | pride, envy, and greed | are the three sparks that have set hearts ablaze.”";durling
1;6;76-78;Here he put an end to the tearful sound. | And I to him: “Again I wish you to instruct me | and make me the gift of further speech.;durling
1;6;79-81;Farinata and Tegghiaio, who were so worthy, | Iacopo Rusticucci, Arrigo and Mosca, | and the others who turned their wits to doing well.;durling
1;6;82-84;"Tell me where they are and cause me to know them; | for great desire urges me to understand | if Heaven sweetens or Hell poisons them.”";durling
1;6;85-87;"And he: “They are among the blacker souls; | various sins weigh them toward the bottom: | if you descend so far, you can see them there.";durling
1;6;88-90;But when you are back in the sweet world, | I beg you, bring me to people’s minds: | no more do I say to you and no more do I answer you.”;durling
1;6;91-93;"His direct eyes then he twisted into oblique ones; | he stared at me a little and then bent his head; | with it he fell level with the other blind ones.";durling
1;6;94-96;And my leader said to me: “Never again will he arise | this side of the angelic trumpet, | when he will see the enemy governor.;durling
1;6;97-99;Each will see again his sad tomb, | will take again his flesh and his shape, | will hear what resounds eternally.”;durling
1;6;100-102;Thus we passed through a filthy mixture | of shades and rain, with slow steps, | touching somewhat on the future life.;durling
1;6;103-105;So I said: “Master, these torments, | will they grow after the great Judgment, | or will they be less, or equally hot?”;durling
1;6;106-108;And he to me: “Return to your philosophy, | which teaches that the more perfect a thing is, | the more it feels what is good, and the same for pain.;durling
1;6;109-111;Even though these cursed people | will never enter into true perfection, | on that side they can expect to have more being than on this.”;durling
1;6;112-114;"We followed that path in a curve, | speaking much more than I recount; | we came to the point where it descends.";durling
1;6;115-115;There we found Plutus, the great enemy.;durling
1;7;1-3;"Pape Satan, pape Satan aleppe!"" began Plutus with his clucking voice; and that noble sage, who knew all things, ";durling
1;7;4-6;"said, to strengthen me: ""Let not your fear harm you; for whatever power he may have shall not prevent us from going down this cliff."" ";durling
1;7;7-9;"Then he turned back to that swollen face and said: ""Silence, cursed wolf! Consume yourself with your rage within. ";durling
1;7;10-12;"Not without cause is our descent to the depths: it is willed on high, where Michael avenged the proud onslaught.""";durling
1;7;13-15;As when sails swollen by the wind fall tangled, when the mast gives way: so did that cruel beast fall to earth.;durling
1;7;16-18;So we descended into the fourth pit, taking in more of the sorrowing bank that bags all the evil of the universe.;durling
1;7;19-21;Ah, justice of God! Who stuffs in so many strange travails and punishments as I saw? And why does our own guilt so destroy us?;durling
1;7;22-24;As the waves do there above Charybdis, breaking over each other as they collide: so the people here must dance their round.;durling
1;7;25-27;Here I saw people more numerous than before, on one side and the other, with great cries rolling weights by the force of their chests.;durling
1;7;28-30;"They would collide, and then right there each one, reversing directions, would look back, crying: ""Why do you hold?"" and ""Why do you toss?""";durling
1;7;31-33;Thus they would return around the dark circle on either hand to the point opposite, again shouting at each other their shameful meter.;durling
1;7;34-36;Then each would turn back, once he had arrived through his half-circle to the other jousting. And I, my heart almost pierced through,;durling
1;7;37-39;"said: ""Master, now explain to me what people this is, and if these tonsured ones to our left were all clerics.""";durling
1;7;40-42;"And he to me: ""Every one of them was so cross-eyed of mind in the first life, that no measure governed their spending.";durling
1;7;43-45;Very clearly do their voices bay it out, when they come to the two points of the circle where their opposing faults disjoin them.;durling
1;7;46-48;"These were clerics, who have no hairy covering to their heads, and popes and cardinals, in whom avarice does its worst.""";durling
1;7;49-51;"And I: ""Master, among this last kind, I should certainly be able to recognize some who were soiled with those ills.""";durling
1;7;52-54;"And he to me: ""You are gathering empty thought: the undiscerning life that befouled them makes them dark now to all recognition.";durling
1;7;55-57;For eternity they will come to the two buttings: these will rise from the tomb with closed fists, these with hair cut short.;durling
1;7;58-60;Bad giving and bad keeping has deprived them of the lovely world and set them to this scuffling: whatever it is, I prettify no words for it.;durling
1;7;61-63;Now you can see, my son, the brief mockery of the goods that are committed to Fortune, for which the human race so squabbles.;durling
1;7;64-66;"For all the gold that is under the moon and that ever was, could not give rest to even one of these weary souls.""";durling
1;7;67-69;"""My master,"" said I, ""now tell me also: this Fortune that you touch on here, what is it, that has the goods of the world so in its clutches?""";durling
1;7;70-72;"And he to me: ""O foolish creatures, how great is the ignorance that injures you! Now I would have you drink in my judgment.";durling
1;7;73-75;He whose wisdom transcends all things fashioned the heavens, and he gave them governors who see that every part shines to every other part.;durling
1;7;76-78;Distributing the light equally. Similarly, for worldly splendors he ordained a general minister and leader,;durling
1;7;79-81;who would transfer from time to time the empty goods from one people to another, from one family to another, beyond any human wisdom’s power to prevent.;durling
1;7;82-84;Therefore one people rules and another languishes, according to her judgment, that is hidden, like the snake in grass.;durling
1;7;85-87;"Your knowledge cannot resist her; she foresees, judges, and carries out her rule as the other gods do theirs.";durling
1;7;88-90;"Her permutations know no truce; necessity makes her swift, so thick come those who must have their turns.";durling
1;7;91-93;This is she who is so crucified even by those who should give her praise, wrongly blaming and speaking ill of her.;durling
1;7;94-96;But she is blessed in herself and does not listen: with the other first creatures, she gladly turns her sphere and rejoices in her blessedness.;durling
1;7;97-99;But now let us go down to even greater pity: already every star is falling that was rising when I set out, and too long a stay is forbidden.;durling
1;7;100-102;We cut across the circle to the other shore, beside a spring that boils and spills into a ditch leading away from it.;durling
1;7;103-105;"The water was much darker than purple; and we, beside the murky wave, entered a strange, descending path.";durling
1;7;106-108;Into the swamp called Styx goes this sad stream, when it has come down to the foot of the evil grey slopes.;durling
1;7;109-111;And I, gazing intently, saw people muddied in that slough, all naked, with indignant expressions.;durling
1;7;112-114;They kept striking each other, and not only with hands, but with head and breast and feet, tearing each other apart with their teeth, piece by piece.;durling
1;7;115-117;"My kind master said: ""Son, now behold the souls of those whom anger vanquished; and I would have you believe, too, as a certainty,";durling
1;7;118-120;that under the water are people who are sighing, making the water bubble at the surface, as your eye will tell you wherever it turns.;durling
1;7;121-123;Fixed in the mire, they say: ‘We were gloomy in the sweet air that the sun makes glad, bearing within us the fumes of sullenness.;durling
1;7;124-126;Now we languish in the black slime.’ This hymn they gurgle in their throats, for they cannot fully form the words.;durling
1;7;127-129;So we wound about a large arc of the filthy swamp, between the dry bank and the wetness, our eyes turned on those who swallow mud.;durling
1;7;130-130;We came to the foot of a tower at the last.;durling
1;8;1-3;I say, continuing, that well before | We reached the foot of the high tower, | Our eyes went up to its summit;durling
1;8;4-6;Because of two small flames we saw placed there, | And another replying from so far away | That the eye could hardly seize it.;durling
1;8;7-9;"And I turned toward the sea of all wisdom; | I said: “What does this one say? | And what does that other fire answer?""";durling
1;8;10-12;And who are those doing this?” | And he to me: “Over the slimy waves | You can already make out what they are waiting for, If the fumes of the swamp do not hide it.”;durling
1;8;13-15; | A bowstring never propelled an arrow to fly | Through the air so swiftly as a little boat I saw ;durling
1;8;16-18;come toward us in that instant | Over the water, governed by a single oarsman, | Who was shouting: “Now you are caught, wicked soul!”;durling
1;8;19-21;"“Phlegyas, Phlegyas, you are shouting uselessly,” | Said my lord, “this time; you will have us | No longer than passing over the bog.”";durling
1;8;22-24;As one who hears of a great deception done to him | And then mutters of it, so became Phlegyas | In his contained anger.;durling
1;8;25-27;"My leader stepped down into the boat | And then had me enter after him; | And only when I was aboard did it seem laden.";durling
1;8;28-30;As soon as my leader and I were in the bark, | The ancient prow set forth, cutting more of the water | Than it does with others.;durling
1;8;31-33;While we were coursing the dead channel, | Before me rose up one covered with mud, | Who said: “Who are you, who come before your hour?”;durling
1;8;34-36;"And I to him: “If I come, I do not remain; | But who are you, who have become so foul?” | He replied: “You see that I am one who weeps.”";durling
1;8;37-39;"And I to him: “With weeping and mourning, | Cursed spirit, now remain; for I recognize you, | Though you are filthy all over.”";durling
1;8;40-42;"Then he stretched out toward the boat both his hands; | But my master, alert, pushed him off, saying: | “Away, over there with the other dogs!”";durling
1;8;43-45;"My neck then with his arm he embraced; | He kissed my face and said: “Disdainful soul, | Blessed be she who was pregnant with you!";durling
1;8;46-48;"In the world he was a person filled with pride; | There is no act of goodness to adorn his memory: | Therefore his shade is so furious here.";durling
1;8;49-51;How many consider themselves great kings up above, | Who here will be like pigs in the mire, | Leaving behind horrible dispraise of themselves!”;durling
1;8;52-54;And I: “Master, much would I desire | To see him ducked in this broth | Before we leave the lake.”;durling
1;8;55-57;And he to me: “Before the shore lets itself be seen, | You will be satisfied: it is fitting | That such a desire be fulfilled.”;durling
1;8;58-60;A little later I saw him torn apart | By those muddy people in such a way | That I still praise God and thank him for it.;durling
1;8;61-63;All were crying: “At Filippo Argenti!” | And the wild Florentine spirit turned | On himself with his teeth.;durling
1;8;64-66;"There we left him, I tell no more of him; | For my ears were now struck by a shrieking | That made me open wide my eyes, intent on what lay ahead.";durling
1;8;67-69;My good master said: “Now, my son, | We approach the city whose name is Dis, | With the weighty citizens, the great host.”;durling
1;8;70-72;And I: “Master, already I discern its mosques | There clearly within the moat, | As red as if they had just come out of the fire.”;durling
1;8;73-75;And he said to me: “The eternal fire | That burns within it makes them glow red, | As you see in this lower Hell.”;durling
1;8;76-78;"Now we arrived within the deep moats | That fortify that unconsolable city; | The walls seemed to me to be of iron.";durling
1;8;79-81;Not without first making a large circle | Did we reach a place where the pilot loudly cried: | “Get out. Here is the entrance.”;durling
1;8;82-84;At the gate I saw more than a thousand | That had rained down from Heaven, who were saying angrily: | “Who is he there, that without death;durling
1;8;85-87;Goes through the kingdom of the dead?” | And my wise master made a sign | That he wished to speak with them secretly.;durling
1;8;88-90;Then they restrained somewhat their great disdain | And said: “You come alone, and send him away, | Who so boldly entered this kingdom.;durling
1;8;91-93;"Let him return alone along his foolhardy path; | Let him try if he can; | For you will remain here, who have escorted him Across so dark a territory.” ";durling
1;8;94-96;| Think, reader, if I became weak | At the sound of those cursed words, For I did not believe I would ever return here.;durling
1;8;97-99; | “O my dear leader, who more than seven times | Have kept me safe and saved me from deep peril,;durling
1;8;100-102;"Do not leave me,” I said, “so undone; | And if passing further is denied us, | Let us retrace our footsteps quickly together.”";durling
1;8;103-105;And that lord who had led me there, said: | “Do not fear, for our passage no one can prevent, | It is granted by such a one.;durling
1;8;106-108;But here await me, and strengthen your weary spirit, | Feeding it with good hope, | For I will not leave you in the underworld.”;durling
1;8;109-111;Thus my sweet father goes off and abandons me | There, and I remain in doubt, | For “yes” and “no” quarrel in my head.;durling
1;8;112-114;"I could not hear what he proffered them; | But he hardly stood with them there, | Before they vied to run back inside.";durling
1;8;115-117;They closed the gate, those adversaries of ours, | In my lord’s face, who remained outside | And turned back to me with slow steps.;durling
1;8;118-120;His eyes were on the ground, | His brow shorn of all boldness, | And he was saying, as he sighed: “Who has denied me the sorrowing houses?”;durling
1;8;121-123; | And to me he said: “You, though I am angered, | Do not be dismayed, for I will overcome this test, However they scurry about inside to prevent it.;durling
1;8;124-126;" | This overweening of theirs is not new; | They used it once before at a less secret gate, Which still cannot be barred:";durling
1;8;127-129; | Above it you saw the dead writing. | And already, passing through the circles without a guide, On this side of it, there comes down the slope,;durling
1;8;130-130; | Such a one that by him the city will be opened | To us.”;durling
1;9;1-3;The color that cowardice brought out on my face, | Seeing my leader turn back, caused him more quickly | To master his own new pallor.;durling
1;9;4-6;"He stood still, attentive, like one who listens; | For his glance could not go far through the black air | And the thick fog.";durling
1;9;7-9;“Still, we must win the fight,” he began, | “If not... such a one was offered to us. | Oh how long it seems to me until someone arrives!”;durling
1;9;10-12;"I saw well how he covered up his beginning | With what came next, words different from the first; | ";durling
1;9;13-15;But nonetheless his speech made me afraid, For I drew from his truncated words a meaning | Worse than perhaps they held. | ;durling
1;9;16-18;“Into this depth of the sad pit Does anyone from the first level ever come, | Of those whose only punishment | Is to have hope cut off?”;durling
1;9;19-21;"Such was my question; and: “Rarely does it happen,” | He replied, “that any of us makes the journey | I am taking.";durling
1;9;22-24;It is true that I have been down here once before, | Conjured by that harsh Erichtho | Who called souls back to their bodies.;durling
1;9;25-27;My flesh had been naked of me only a little while, | When she made me enter those walls, | To bring up a spirit from the circle of Judas.;durling
1;9;28-30;"That is the lowest place and the darkest | And the farthest from the sky that turns all things: | Well do I know the way; therefore be free of care.";durling
1;9;31-33;This swamp that breathes forth the great stench | Girds the grieving city all about, | Where now we cannot enter without wrath.”;durling
1;9;34-36;"And he said more, but I do not remember it; | For my eyes had made me all intent | On the high tower with its glowing summit,";durling
1;9;37-39;Where suddenly, in an instant, stood up | Three Furies of Hell, stained with blood, | Who had the limbs and gestures of women;durling
1;9;40-42;"And were girt with bright green water snakes; | Little asps and horned serpents they had for hair, | Which wound about their fierce temples.";durling
1;9;43-45;And he, who well knew the maid-servants | Of the queen of eternal weeping, | Said: “Look at the ferocious Erinyes.;durling
1;9;46-48;"This is Megaera on the left; | She who weeps on the right there is Allecto; | Tisiphone is in the middle,” and he fell silent.";durling
1;9;49-51;"With her nails each was tearing at her breast; | They beat themselves with their palms and shrieked so loudly | That for fear I drew closer to the poet.";durling
1;9;52-54;"“Let Medusa come: so we will turn him to stone,” | They were all saying, looking down; | “We did ill in not avenging Theseus’ attack.”";durling
1;9;55-57;"“Turn around and keep your eyes closed; | For if the Gorgon appears and you should see her, | There would never be any going back up.”";durling
1;9;58-60;"So spoke my master; and he himself turned me, | And he did not stop with my hands, | But closed me up with his own as well.";durling
1;9;61-63;O you who have sound intellects, | Gaze on the teaching that is hidden | Beneath the veil of the strange verses.;durling
1;9;64-66;And already, over across the turbid waves, | Came the crashing of a fearful sound, | At which both the banks were shaking,;durling
1;9;67-69;Not otherwise than of a wind | Made impetuous by conflicting heats, | That strikes the wood and without resistance;durling
1;9;70-72;"Shatters the branches, beats them down, | And carries them away; full of dust | It goes proudly on and makes the beasts flee.";durling
1;9;73-75;He loosed my eyes and said: | “Now direct your beam of sight | Out over that ancient foam, There where the smoke is darkest.”;durling
1;9;76-78; | Like frogs before the enemy snake, | Who scatter themselves through the water, Until each huddles on the bottom:;durling
1;9;79-81; | So saw I more than a thousand shattered souls | Fleeing before one who was walking across Styx with dry feet.;durling
1;9;82-84;From his face he was moving that greasy air, | Waving his left hand before him frequently, | And only of that discomfort did he seem weary.;durling
1;9;85-87;Well did I perceive that he was sent from Heaven, | And I turned to my master, who made a sign | That I should stand still and bow to him.;durling
1;9;88-90;Ah, how full of disdain he seemed to me! | He came to the gate and with a little wand | He opened it, for nothing held it.;durling
1;9;91-93;“O driven forth from Heaven, despised people,” | He began on the horrid threshold, | “How is this overweening nursed in you?;durling
1;9;94-96;Why do you kick back against that Will | Whose ends can never be cut short | And which has many times increased your suffering?;durling
1;9;97-99;What is the good of butting against fate? | Your Cerberus, if you remember, | Still has his chin and gullet stripped because of it.”;durling
1;9;100-102;"Then he turned back along the filthy way | And said not a word to us; | He had the look of a man Whom other cares urge and gnaw";durling
1;9;103-105;" | More than his who stands before him; | And we directed our feet toward the city, Unafraid after the holy words.";durling
1;9;106-108;" | We entered in without any battle; | And I, eager to examine what lay inside,";durling
1;9;109-111;"As soon as I was within, cast my eyes around; | I saw on every hand a broad plain, | Full of grief and harsh torments.";durling
1;9;112-114;As at Arles, where the Rhone makes its delta, | As at Pola, near the Carnaro | That encloses Italy and bathes its boundaries,;durling
1;9;115-117;Tombs variegate the place, so they did here, | Except that the manner was more bitter: | Among the tombs flames were scattered,;durling
1;9;118-120;By which they were so entirely fired | That no art asks for iron that is hotter. | ;durling
1;9;121-123;All their covers were lifted, And from them came forth laments so grievous | That they surely seemed those of wretches suffering within. | ;durling
1;9;124-126;And I: “Master, Who are the people buried within these arks, | Who make themselves heard | With anguished sighs?”;durling
1;9;127-129;And he to me: “Here are the chiefs of heresies | With their followers, of every sect, | And much more than you believe are the tombs laden.;durling
1;9;130-132;Like with like is buried here, | And the monuments are more and less hot.” | And when he had turned to the right,;durling
1;9;133-133;We passed between the torments and the high battlements.;durling
1;10;1-3;Now my master walks along a secret path, | Between the wall of the city and the torments, | And I at his back.;durling
1;10;4-6;“O highest power, who wheel me through the | Wicked circles as you please,” I began, | “Speak to me and satisfy my desires.;durling
1;10;7-9;The people who are lying in the sepulchers, | Could they be seen? for all the covers are lifted, | And no one is standing guard.”;durling
1;10;10-12;And he to me: “All will be closed | When from Jehoshaphat they return | With the bodies they left up there.;durling
1;10;13-15;Epicurus and his followers | Have their cemetery in this part, | Who make the soul die with the body.;durling
1;10;16-18;Therefore your request will soon be satisfied | Here within, and also the desire | You leave unspoken.”;durling
1;10;19-21;And I: “Kind leader, I hide my heart from you | Only in order to speak briefly, | And you have so inclined me, not only just now.”;durling
1;10;22-24;“O Tuscan who through the city of fire, | Alive, walk along speaking so modestly, | Let it please you to stop in this place.;durling
1;10;25-27;Your speech makes you manifest | As a native of that noble fatherland | To which perhaps I was too harmful.”;durling
1;10;28-30;"Suddenly this sound came forth from one of the arks; | Therefore I shrank, afraid, | Somewhat closer to my leader.";durling
1;10;31-33;And he said: “Turn! What are you doing? | See there Farinata who has stood erect: | From the waist up you will see all of him.”;durling
1;10;34-36;"I had already fixed my eyes in his; | And he was rising up with his breast and forehead | As if he had Hell in great disdain.";durling
1;10;37-39;And the spirited, quick hands of my leader | Pushed me among the sepulchers toward him, | Saying, “Let your words be counted.”;durling
1;10;40-42;When I stood at the foot of his tomb, | He gazed at me a little, and then, as if scornful, | Asked me: “Who were your forebears?”;durling
1;10;43-45;"I, desiring to obey, did not hide it, | But opened it all to him; and he | Raised his brows a little upwards.";durling
1;10;46-48;Then he said: “Fiercely were they opposed | To me and to my ancestors and to my party, | So that twice I scattered them.”;durling
1;10;49-51;"“If they were driven out, they returned from every side,” | I replied, “the first time and the second; | But your people did not learn that art well.”";durling
1;10;52-54;"Then a shade rose up, discovered to sight | As far as the chin, alongside the first one; | I think it had risen to its knees.";durling
1;10;55-57;It looked around me, as anxious to see | Whether another were with me, | And after its peering was entirely spent,;durling
1;10;58-60;Weeping it said: “If through this blind prison | You are going because of your high genius, | Where is my son, and why is he not with you?”;durling
1;10;61-63;And I to him: “I do not come on my own: | He who is waiting over there leads me through here, | Perhaps to one your Guido had in disdain.”;durling
1;10;64-66;"His words and the manner of his punishment | Had already read to me his name; | Therefore was my reply so full.";durling
1;10;67-69;Of a sudden risen to his feet, he cried: | “How did you say? ‘He had’? Is he no longer alive? | Does the sweet light no longer strike his eyes?”;durling
1;10;70-72;When he perceived a certain delay I made | Before replying, he fell back supine | And appeared no more outside.;durling
1;10;73-75;"But that other great-souled one, | At whose request I had stopped, | Did not change his expression, Nor move his neck, nor bend his side;";durling
1;10;76-78; | But, resuming his earlier speech: | “If they have learned that art badly, That torments me more than this bed.;durling
1;10;79-81; | But not fifty times will be rekindled | The face of the lady who reigns here, Before you will know how much that art weighs.;durling
1;10;82-84; | And as you hope ever to return | To the sweet world, tell me: Why is that people so cruel against mine | In all its laws?” ;durling
1;10;85-87;| Therefore I to him: “The slaughter and the great loss | That stained the Arbia red, | Causes such orations to be made in our temple.”;durling
1;10;88-90;After he had moved his head, sighing, | “In that I was not alone,” he said, | “Nor certainly without cause Would I have moved with the others.;durling
1;10;91-93; | But I alone, there where all others | Would have suffered Florence to be razed, Was the one who defended her openly.”;durling
1;10;94-96; | “Ah, so may your seed at some time rest,” | I begged him, “untie the knot That has entangled my judgment here.;durling
1;10;97-99; | It seems that you see beforehand, if I hear well, | What time will bring, But in the present have a different mode.” ;durling
1;10;100-102;| “We see, as does one in bad light, the things,” | He said, “that are distant from us: So much the highest Leader still shines for us.;durling
1;10;103-105;" | When they approach or are present, our intellect | Is utterly empty; And if another does not bring news, | We know nothing of your human state.";durling
1;10;106-108; | Thus you can comprehend That our knowledge will be entirely dead | From that point when the door | Of the future will be closed.”;durling
1;10;109-111;"Then, as if repentant of my fault, I said: | “Now will you tell that fallen one | His son is still joined with the living;";durling
1;10;112-114;And if, earlier, I was silent before replying, | Make him know that I did it | Because I was already thinking In the error that you have untied for me.” |;durling
1;10;115-117;" And already my master was calling me back;  Therefore more hurriedly I begged the spirit to tell me who was there with him.";durling
1;10;118-120;" | He told me: “Here with more than a thousand I lie: | Here within is the second Frederick And the Cardinal; and of the others I do not speak.”";durling
1;10;121-123;" | Then he hid himself; and I turned my steps | Toward the ancient poet, Thinking back on that speech | Which seemed hostile to me. ";durling
1;10;124-126;"| He moved on; and then, walking, He said: “Why are you so dismayed?” | And I answered his question fully. ";durling
1;10;127-129;"| “Let your memory preserve What you have heard against you,” that sage commanded me; | “And now pay attention here,” | And he raised his finger:";durling
1;10;130-132;“When you are before her sweet ray | Whose lovely eye sees all, | From her you will know the journey of your life.”;durling
1;10;133-135;Then he moved his foot toward the left: | We turned from the wall and walked toward the center, | Along a path that cuts straight to a valley;durling
1;10;136-136;Whose stench was displeasing even up there.;durling
1;11;1-3;"At the edge of a high cliff, made by great rocks Broken in a circle, we came above a crueler crowding; ";durling
1;11;4-6;"And there, because of the horrible excess of stench, Cast up by the abyss, we moved back beside the lid

";durling
1;11;7-9;"Of a great tomb, where I saw writing which said: “IT hold Pope Anastasius, whom Photinus drew from The straight way.”
";durling
1;11;10-12;"“Our descent will have to be delayed, so that our Sense can become a little accustomed to the evil Smell; and then we can disregard it.”";durling
1;11;13-15;"So my master; and I to him: “Find something to Compensate, so that the time may not be lost.” And He: “You see I am considering it.”";durling
1;11;16-18;“My son, within these rocks,” he then began to Say, “are three smaller circles descending step by Step, like those you are leaving.;durling
1;11;19-21;"All are full of cursed spirits; but so that later the Mere sight of them may suffice, hear how they are Constricted and why.";durling
1;11;22-24;Of every malice gaining the hatred of Heaven, Injustice is the goal, and every such goal injures Someone either with force or with fraud.;durling
1;11;25-27;"But because fraud is an evil proper to man, it is More displeasing to God; and therefore the Fraudulent have a lower place and greater pain Assails them.";durling
1;11;28-30;"Of the violent the first circle is full; but because Violence can be directed against three persons, the Circle is divided and constructed in three subcircles.";durling
1;11;31-33;To God, to oneself, and to one’s neighbor one can Do violence, that is, to them and to their possessions, As you will hear with clear reason.;durling
1;11;34-36;"Death by violence and painful wounds can be Inflicted on one’s neighbor, and on his possessions Ruin, fires, and wrongful extortion;";durling
1;11;37-39;Thus homicides and whoever wrongfully strikes, Spoilers, and bandits, all are tormented in the first Subcircle in different groups.;durling
1;11;40-42;"One can turn a violent hand against oneself or One’s own possessions; therefore in the second Subcircle each must uselessly repent";durling
1;11;43-45;Whoever deprives himself of your world, or utterly Squanders and undermines his wealth, and weeps Where he should be happy.;durling
1;11;46-48;"One can use force against the Deity by denying it And cursing it in one’s heart or by scorning Nature And its goodness;";durling
1;11;49-51;And therefore the smallest subcircle stamps with Its seal Sodom and Cahors and whoever speaks with Scorn of God in his heart.;durling
1;11;52-54;Fraud, which bites at every mind, a man can use Against one who trusts in him or against one who has In his purse no cause for trust.;durling
1;11;55-57;"This latter mode seems to cut solely into the bond Of love that Nature makes; thus in the second circle Find their nest";durling
1;11;58-60;Hypocrisy, flattery, casters of spells, impersonators, Thievery and simony, panders, embezzlers, and Similar filth.;durling
1;11;61-63;"The former mode forgets the love that Nature Makes and also that which is added to it, from which Special trust is created;";durling
1;11;64-66;Thus in the smallest circle, at the point of the Universe where Dis is enthroned, whoever is a traitor Is eternally consumed.”;durling
1;11;67-69;And I: “Master, your reasoning proceeds most Clearly and divides very well this pit and the people It possesses.;durling
1;11;70-72;But tell me: those of the greasy swamp, those Driven by the wind and beaten by the rain, and those Who collide with such harsh words,;durling
1;11;73-75;Why are they not punished inside the ruddy city, If they are under God’s wrath? and if not, why are They treated so?”;durling
1;11;76-78;And he to me: “Why does your wit,” he said, “so Wander from its usual course? or where does your Mind gaze mistaken?;durling
1;11;79-81;Do you not remember the words with which your Ethics treats so fully the three dispositions that Heaven refuses,;durling
1;11;82-84;Incontinence, malice, and mad bestiality? and how Incontinence offends God less and acquires less Blame?;durling
1;11;85-87;If you consider this judgment well and bring to Mind who those are that undergo their penitence Higher up and outside,;durling
1;11;88-90;You will see clearly why they are separated from These wicked ones and why God’s justice hammers Them less wrathfully.”;durling
1;11;91-93;“O sun that heals every clouded sight, you content Me so when you resolve questions, that doubting is no Less pleasurable than knowing.;durling
1;11;94-96;Turn back a little yet again,” I said, “to where you Say that usury offends God’s goodness, and untie That knot.”;durling
1;11;97-99;“Philosophy,” he said, “to one who understands it, Notes, and not merely in one place, how Nature takes Its course;durling
1;11;100-102;"From the divine intellect and art; and if you take Good note of your Physics, you will see, after not Many pages,";durling
1;11;103-105;"That your art follows Nature as much as it can, as A disciple follows the master; so that your art is Almost God’s grandchild.";durling
1;11;106-108;"From these two, if you bring to mind the Beginning of Genesis, we must draw our life and Advance our people;";durling
1;11;109-111;And because the usurer holds another way, he Scorns Nature in herself and in her follower, since he Puts his hope in something else.;durling
1;11;112-114;"But follow me now, for I desire to go; the Fishes Are wriggling up over the horizon, and the Wain lies Entirely above the northwest wind,";durling
1;11;115-115;And it is far to the place where we must climb Down this bank.”;durling
1;12;1-3;The place where we came to descend the bank Was mountainous, and, because of what else was There, such that every sight would shun it.;durling
1;12;4-6;Like that landslide which struck the flank of the Adige this side of Trento, because of an earthquake Or the failing of support,;durling
1;12;7-9;Where from the summit of the mountain, whence They fell, down to the plain, the rocks lie so strewn That they would provide a path for one who was above:;durling
1;12;10-12;"Such was the descent into that valley; and at the Very point where the slope had broken, the infamy of Crete was stretched out,";durling
1;12;13-15;"The one conceived in the false cow; and when he Saw us, he bit himself like one broken within by Anger.";durling
1;12;16-18;My wise one shouted toward him: “Perhaps you Believe the duke of Athens is here, who put you to Death up in the world?;durling
1;12;19-21;Away, beast, for this man does not come taught By your sister, but goes to see your punishments.”;durling
1;12;22-24;Like a bull that wrenches free at the moment it Has received the mortal blow, that is unable to walk But jumps here and there,;durling
1;12;25-27;"So I saw the Minotaur do; and that alert one cried: “Run to the crossing; it is good to go down while he Is in his fit.”";durling
1;12;28-30;So we took our way down along that scree, and The stones kept moving under my feet, because of Their new burden.;durling
1;12;31-33;"I walked thoughtful; and he said: “You are Thinking perhaps of this landslide, guarded by that Bestial anger I just now put out.";durling
1;12;34-36;Now I would have you know that the other time I Came down here into lower Hell, this cliff had not yet Fallen.;durling
1;12;37-39;But certainly, if I remember well, a little before he Came who took from Dis the great spoils of the Highest circle,;durling
1;12;40-42;On every side this deep, foul valley trembled so That I thought the universe must be feeling love, by Which, some believe,;durling
1;12;43-45;The world has often been turned back into chaos: And at that point this ancient cliff, here and Elsewhere, was broken down.;durling
1;12;46-48;But probe the valley with your sight, for we are Approaching the river of blood, in which are boiling Those who harm others with violence.”;durling
1;12;49-51;Oh blind cupidity and mad rage, that so spur us In this short life, and then in the eternal one cook us So evilly!;durling
1;12;52-54;"I saw an ample, curving ditch that embraces the Entire plain, according to what my guide had said;";durling
1;12;55-57;" And between the foot of the cliff and it, centaurs 
Were running in file, armed with arrows, as they Used to go hunting in the world.";durling
1;12;58-60;"Seeing us come down, each stopped, and from the File three came forth with bows and with arrows they Had selected first;";durling
1;12;61-63;"And one cried from afar: “To what punishment do You come, you who are climbing down the bank?  Speak from there; otherwise I draw my bow.”";durling
1;12;64-66;"My master said: “The reply will we make to Chiron, close over there; to your harm has your will Always been so hasty.”";durling
1;12;67-69;Then he nudged me and said: “That is Nessus, Who died because of fair Deianira and himself Avenged himself.;durling
1;12;70-72;"The one in the middle, who is gazing at his breast, Is the great Chiron, who brought up Achilles; that Other is Pholus, who was so full of anger.";durling
1;12;73-75;Around the ditch they go by thousands, shooting With arrows whatever soul emerges from the blood More than his guilt allots.”;durling
1;12;76-78;We drew near those swift beasts: Chiron took an Arrow, and with the notch he moved his beard back From his jaw.;durling
1;12;79-81;When he had uncovered his great mouth, he said To his companions: “Have you noticed that the one Behind moves what he touches?;durling
1;12;82-84;The feet of the dead usually do not so.” And my Good leader, who already stood at his breast, where The two natures are wedded,;durling
1;12;85-87;"Replied: “He is indeed alive; and thus alone I must Show him the dark valley; necessity induces us, and Not pleasure.";durling
1;12;88-90;One left off singing hallelujah who entrusted me With this strange task: he is not a robber nor I a Thievish soul.;durling
1;12;91-93;But by that Power through which I move my steps Along so wild a road, give us one of yours to guide Us;durling
1;12;94-96;And show us where the ford is, and carry this one On his rump, for he is not a spirit that can walk upon The air.”;durling
1;12;97-99;Chiron turned on his right breast, and said to Nessus: “Go back and guide them, and, if you meet Another company, make them give way.”;durling
1;12;100-102;Now we go with our trusty escort along the bank Of the red boiling, where the boiled ones were Uttering high shrieks.;durling
1;12;103-105;"I saw people immersed as far as the brow; and the Great centaur said: “They are tyrants who put their Hands to blood and to others’ goods.";durling
1;12;106-108;There they weep for their pitiless crimes: there is Alexander and fierce Dionysius, who gave Sicily such Grievous years.;durling
1;12;109-111;"And that forehead with such black hair is Azzolino; and that other blond one is Obizzo da Este, Who truly was murdered by his bastard up in the world.”";durling
1;12;112-114;Then I turned to my poet, and he said: “Let him now Be first for you, and I second.”;durling
1;12;115-117;A little further along, the centaur stopped above People who seemed to emerge from the boiling Stream as far as the throat.;durling
1;12;118-120;He pointed to a soul by itself to one side, saying: “That one cleft, in the bosom of God, the heart that Still drips blood along the Thames.”;durling
1;12;121-123;"Then I saw people who held their heads out of the River and then all their trunks; and of them I Recognized many.";durling
1;12;124-126;"Thus the blood became shallower and shallower, Until it was cooking only feet; and there was our Passing of the ditch.";durling
1;12;127-129;“Just as on this side you see the boiling stream Diminish,” said the centaur, “I would have you Believe;durling
1;12;130-132;That on this other side it lowers its bed deeper and Deeper, until it reaches the depth where tyranny Must moan.;durling
1;12;133-135;Over there God’s justice pierces that Attila who Was a scourge on earth, and Pyrrhus and Sextus, and For eternity milks;durling
1;12;136-138;The tears unlocked by the boiling from Rinier da Corneto and Rinier Pazzo, who waged such war on The roads.”;durling
1;12;139-139;Then he turned and passed back over the ford.;durling
1;13;1-3;Not yet had Nessus reached the other side, when We entered a wood that no path marked. ;durling
1;13;4-6;Not green leaves, but dark in color, not smooth Branches, but knotted and twisted, no fruit was there, But thorns with poison.;durling
1;13;7-9;Not such harsh thickets nor so dense do those Wild beasts hold, that hate the cultivated places Between Cécina and Corneto.;durling
1;13;10-12;There the ugly Harpies make their nests, who Drove the Trojans from the Strophades with dire Prophecy of their future woe.;durling
1;13;13-15;"Their wings are broad, their necks and faces Human, their feet have claws, and their great bellies Are feathered; they utter laments on the strange trees.";durling
1;13;16-18;And my good master: “Before you enter, know That you are in the second subcircle,” he began to say, “And will be ;durling
1;13;19-21;"until you come to the horrible sands. Therefore look carefully; and you will see things that would Make you disbelieve my speech.”";durling
1;13;22-24;I heard cries of woe on every side but saw no Person uttering them, so that all dismayed I stood Still.;durling
1;13;25-27;My belief is that he believed that I must believe That so many voices, among those thickets, came Forth from people hidden from us.;durling
1;13;28-30;Therefore my master said: “If you break off some Little twig from one of these plants, the thoughts you Have will all be cut off.”;durling
1;13;31-33;"Then I stretched out my hand a little before me And plucked a small branch from a great thornbush; And its stem cried out: “Why do you split me?”";durling
1;13;34-36;When it had become dark with blood, it began Again: “Why do you pluck me? Have you no spirit of Pity at all?;durling
1;13;37-39;We were men, and now we have become plants: Truly your hand should be more merciful had we Been the souls of serpents.”;durling
1;13;40-42;As when a green log is burnt at one end, from the Other it drips and sputters as air escapes: ;durling
1;13;43-45;So from the broken stump came forth words and Blood together, and I let the tip fall and stood like One afraid.;durling
1;13;46-48;“If he could have believed first,” replied my sage, “O wounded soul, what he has seen only in my Rhymes,;durling
1;13;49-51;"He would not have stretched out his hand against You; but the incredible thing made me induce him to Do what pains me as well.";durling
1;13;52-54;But tell him who you were, so that as a kind of Amends he may refresh your fame in the world Above, where he is permitted to return.”;durling
1;13;55-57;And the branch: “You so tempt me with sweet Speech that I cannot be silent, and let it not vex you That I am lured to speak a little.;durling
1;13;58-60;I am he who held both the keys to the heart of Frederick and turned them, locking and unlocking, so Gently;durling
1;13;61-63;"That I excluded almost everyone else from his Intimacy; I kept faith with my glorious office, so Much that because of it I lost sleep and vigor.";durling
1;13;64-66;The whore who never turns her sluttish eyes away From Caesar’s dwelling, the common death and vice of Courts,;durling
1;13;67-69;"Inflamed against me all spirits; and those inflamed Inflamed Augustus so that my bright honors turned To sad mourning.";durling
1;13;70-72;My spirit, at the taste of disdain, believing by Death to flee disdain, made me unjust against my just Self.;durling
1;13;73-75;By the strange new roots of this wood, I swear to You that I never broke faith with my lord, who was So worthy of honor.;durling
1;13;76-78;And if either of you goes back to the world, Strengthen my memory, languishing still beneath the Blow that envy dealt it.”;durling
1;13;79-81;My poet waited a little, and then, “Now that he is Silent,” he said, “do not lose the moment, but speak, Question him further if you will.”;durling
1;13;82-84;"And I to him: “You ask him again about what you Think will satisfy me; for I could not, so much pity Weighs on my heart.”";durling
1;13;85-87;Therefore he began again: “So may one do Liberally for you what your speech has begged, Imprisoned spirit, let it please you still;durling
1;13;88-90;"To tell us how the soul is bound in these knots; And tell us, if you can, if anyone ever unties himself From such limbs.”";durling
1;13;91-93;The broken branch hissed loudly, and then that Wind was converted into these words: “Briefly will You be answered.;durling
1;13;94-96;When the fierce soul departs from the body from Which it has uprooted itself, Minos sends it to the Seventh mouth.;durling
1;13;97-99;It falls into the wood, and no place is assigned to It, but where chance hurls it, there it sprouts like a Grain of spelt.;durling
1;13;100-102;"It grows into a shoot, then a woody plant; the Harpies, feeding on its leaves, give it pain and a Window for the pain.";durling
1;13;103-105;Like the others, we will come for our remains, but Not so that any may put them on again, for it is not Just to have what one has taken from oneself.;durling
1;13;106-108;Here we will drag them, and through the sad Wood our corpses will hang, each on the thornbush Of the soul that harmed it.”;durling
1;13;109-111;We were still attentive to the broken branch, Believing it had more to say, when we were Surprised by a noise:;durling
1;13;112-114;Like one who hears the boar and the hunt Approaching his post, who hears the beasts, and the Branches breaking.;durling
1;13;115-117;And behold two on our left, naked and scratched, Fleeing so fast that they were breaking every Opposing branch in the forest.;durling
1;13;118-120;The one in front: “Now hurry, hurry, death!” And The other, who seemed to himself too slow, “Lano, Not so nimble were ;durling
1;13;121-123;"your legs at the jousts at Toppo!” And perhaps because his breath was failing, he made one clump of
himself and a bush.";durling
1;13;124-126;Behind them the wood was full of black bitches, Ravenous and running like greyhounds loosed from The chain.;durling
1;13;127-129;"They set their teeth to the one that had squatted, Tearing him to pieces, bit by bit; then they carried off Those suffering members.";durling
1;13;130-132;My guide then took me by the hand and led me To the bush that wept through its bleeding wounds in Vain.;durling
1;13;133-135;“O Jacopo,” it was saying, “di Santo Andrea, what Did it profit you to make a shield of me? how am I to Blame for your wicked life?”;durling
1;13;136-138;When my master stopped above it, he said: “Who Were you, who through so many splintered branches Puff out with blood your sad speech?”;durling
1;13;139-141;And he to us: “O souls who have arrived to see The shameful rending that has so divided my leaves From me,;durling
1;13;142-144;Gather them together at the foot of my sad shrub. I was from the city that for the Baptist changed its First patron, who for this;durling
1;13;145-147;"with his art will always grieve it. And were it not
that at the crossing of Arno there still remains some
trace of him,";durling
1;13;148-150;"those citizens who refounded it 
upon the ashes left by Attila, would have labored in vain.";durling
1;13;151-151;I made a gibbet for myself of my houses.”;durling
1;14;1-3;Compelled by love of my birthplace, I gathered Together the scattered leaves and returned them to Him, who was already silent.;durling
1;14;4-6;Thence we came to the boundary where the Second subcircle is divided from the third, and where One sees a horrible art of justice.;durling
1;14;7-9;"To make the new things clearly manifest, I say That we arrived at a plain that removes every plant From its bed;";durling
1;14;10-12;The grieving wood is a garland around it, as the Sad ditch is to the wood: we halted our steps at the Very edge.;durling
1;14;13-15;The floor was coarse, dry sand, not made Differently from that once trodden by the feet of Cato.;durling
1;14;16-18;O vengeance of God, how much must you be Feared by everyone who reads what was made Manifest to my eyes!;durling
1;14;19-21;Of naked souls I saw many flocks, all weeping Wretchedly, and different laws seemed to govern Them.;durling
1;14;22-24;Some were lying supine on the earth, some were Sitting all huddled, and some were walking Ceaselessly.;durling
1;14;25-27;The flock that was walking was largest by far, and Fewest were those lying to be tortured, but their Tongues were looser to cry out.;durling
1;14;28-30;Over all the sand there rained, with a slow falling, Broad flakes of fire, like snow in the mountains Without wind.;durling
1;14;31-33;Like the flames that Alexander saw, in those hot Parts of India, falling down on his host, whole all the Way to the ground,;durling
1;14;34-36;So that he provided for the earth to be trampled By his squadrons, since the burning was better Extinguished while separated:;durling
1;14;37-39;So the eternal burning was coming down, and the Sand caught fire, like tinder beneath the flint, to Double the suffering.;durling
1;14;40-42;Without any rest ever was the dancing of their Wretched hands, brushing away the fresh burning, Now from there, now from here.;durling
1;14;43-45;I began: “Master, you who overcome all things, Save the hard demons who came out against us at The gate,;durling
1;14;46-48;Who is that great one who seems not to mind the Fire, and lies there scornful and frowning, so that the Rain does not seem to ripen him?”;durling
1;14;49-51;And he himself, when he perceived that I was Questioning my leader about him, cried out: “As I Was alive, so am I dead.;durling
1;14;52-54;Though Jove tire out his smith, from whom he Wrathful took the sharp thunderbolt that struck me On the last day—;durling
1;14;55-57;And though he weary the others, turn after turn, at The black forge in Mongibello, calling, ‘Good Vulcan, Help, help!’;durling
1;14;58-60;As he did at the battle of Phlegra—and strike me With all his force, he could not have happy Vengeance thereby.”;durling
1;14;61-63;Then my leader spoke more forcefully than I had Ever heard him: “O Capaneus, since Is not extinguished, ;durling
1;14;64-66;"your price you are punished more; no Punishment, other than your rage, would be Suffering of a measure with your fury.”";durling
1;14;67-69;"Then he turned back to me with a better look, Saying: “This was one of the seven kings who Besieged Thebes; and he had, and seems still to have, ";durling
1;14;70-72;"God in disdain, and respects him little; but, as I Said, his spite is the ornament his breast deserves.";durling
1;14;73-75;Now follow me, and beware that you not place Your foot on the burning sand as yet, but keep your Feet still close within the wood.”;durling
1;14;76-78;"Silent we came to where a little stream spurts out Of the wood; its red color still makes me shudder.";durling
1;14;79-81;As from Bulicame a river comes forth that the Sinning women then divide among themselves, so This one flowed down across the sand.;durling
1;14;82-84;Its bed and both its banks were made of stone, And the margins on the sides, so that I perceived our Path lay there.;durling
1;14;85-87;“Among all the other things I have shown you Since we entered the gate whose threshold is denied To none,;durling
1;14;88-90;Nothing has been perceived by your eyes as Notable as the present river, which extinguishes all the Flames above it.”;durling
1;14;91-93;These were my leader’s words, and I begged him To grant me the food, since he had granted me the Hunger for it.;durling
1;14;94-96;“In the midst of the sea lies a ruined land,” he said Then, “called Crete, under whose king the world once Was chaste.;durling
1;14;97-99;"A mountain is there that once was happy with Water and foliage, called Ida; now it is desolate, like An outworn thing.";durling
1;14;100-102;Rhea chose it once to be the trusted cradle of her Son, and, the better to hide him when he cried, Ordered the shouting there.;durling
1;14;103-105;Within the mountain stands erect a great old man, With his back toward Damietta, looking toward Rome As to his mirror.;durling
1;14;106-108;"His head is formed of fine gold, and pure silver Are his arms and breast; then he is of brass as far as The fork;";durling
1;14;109-111;"From there downward he is all refined iron, except That his right foot is baked clay; and on that one, More than on the other, he stands erect.";durling
1;14;112-114;Each part of him, except his golden head, is Broken by a crack that drips tears, which, gathering, Bore through that cave.;durling
1;14;115-117;"Their course plunges into this valley; they become Acheron, Styx, and Phlegethon; then they go on Down through this narrow duct,";durling
1;14;118-120;"Until, where there is no further descent, they Become Cocytus; and what that pool is like you will See, so that I do not describe it here.”";durling
1;14;121-123;And I to him: “If the present stream flows down In this way from our world, why does it appear only At this border?”;durling
1;14;124-126;"And he to me: “You know that the place is Circular; and although you have come a long way, Descending and turning always to the left, toward the Bottom,";durling
1;14;127-129;"You have not yet turned through the whole circle; So that if we see some new thing, it should not bring Amazement to your face.”";durling
1;14;130-132;And I again: “Master, where are Phlegethon and Lethe? for you are silent about the one, and the other You say flows from this rain of tears.”;durling
1;14;133-135;“In all your questions, certainly, you please me,” He replied, “but the boiling of the red water ought to Answer one of them.;durling
1;14;136-138;Lethe you will see, but outside this ditch, there Where the souls go to be washed once their repented Guilt has been removed.”;durling
1;14;139-141;"Then he said: “Now it is time for us to leave the Wood; see that you come behind me: the margins Provide a path, for they are not burned,";durling
1;14;142-142;And above them every flame is extinguished.”;durling
1;15;1-3;Now one of the hard margins carries us along, And the vapor from the river gives a shelter that Protects the water and the banks from the fire.;durling
1;15;4-6;"As the Flemings, between Wissant and Bruges, Fearing the tide that rises against them, make dykes To escape the sea;";durling
1;15;7-9;And as the Paduans do along the Brenta, to protect Their farms and castles, before Carinthia feels the Thaw:;durling
1;15;10-12;After that image were these made, though not so High nor so thick, whoever he may have been, the Master-builder made them.;durling
1;15;13-15;We had already come so far from the wood that I Would not have seen where it was, though I had Turned back,;durling
1;15;16-18;When we encountered a band of souls coming Along the barrier, and each was gazing at us as in the Evening;durling
1;15;19-21;"People gaze at one another under the new moon; And they sharpened their brows toward us as the old Tailor does at the eye of his needle.";durling
1;15;22-24;Looked over in this way by such a company, I Was recognized by one, who seized me by the hem And cried: “What a marvel!”;durling
1;15;25-27;And I, when he stretched out his arm toward me, Penetrated with my eye his baked appearance, so That his scorched face did not prevent;durling
1;15;28-30;"My intellect from recognizing him; and, reaching My hand down toward his face, I replied: “Are you Here, ser Brunetto?”";durling
1;15;31-33;And he: “O my son, let it not displease you if Brunetto Latino turns back with you a little and lets his Troop run on.”;durling
1;15;34-36;"I said to him: “As much as I can, I beg you; and if You wish me to sit down with you, I will do so, if he Over there permits it, for I am going with him.”";durling
1;15;37-39;“O son,” he said, “whoever of this flock stands still For an instant, must then lie for a hundred years Without brushing off the fire that strikes him.;durling
1;15;40-42;"Therefore walk on; I will come along at your skirts, And then I will rejoin my crew, who go bewailing their Eternal losses.”";durling
1;15;43-45;I did not dare descend from the path to walk level With him, but I kept my head bowed, as one might Walk reverently.;durling
1;15;46-48;He began: “What fortune or destiny leads you Down here before your last day? and who is this Showing you the way?”;durling
1;15;49-51;“Up there above, under the clear sky,” I replied, “I Lost myself in a valley, before my age was full.;durling
1;15;52-54;Only yesterday morning did I turn my back on it: He appeared to me as I was returning there again, And is leading me back home by this road.”;durling
1;15;55-57;"And he to me: “If you follow your star, you Cannot fail to reach a glorious port, if I perceived Well during sweet life;";durling
1;15;58-60;And if I had not died so early, seeing the heavens So kindly toward you I would have given you Strength for the work.;durling
1;15;61-63;But that ungrateful, malicious people who came Down from Fiesole of old, and still smack of the Mountain and the granite,;durling
1;15;64-66;"Will become your enemies because of your just Actions; and that is reasonable, for among the sour Crab apples it is not fitting that the sweet fig bear its fruit.";durling

1;15;73-75;Let the Fiesolan beasts make straw of each other, But let them not touch the plant, if any still sprout in Their manure,;durling
1;15;76-78;In which may live again the holy seed of the Romans who remained there when that nest of so Much malice was built.”;durling
1;15;79-81;"“If my request were all fulfilled,” I replied to him, “You would not yet be banished from human nature; ";durling
1;15;82-84;For in my memory is fixed, and now it weighs on My heart, the dear, kind paternal image of you when, In the world, from time to time;durling
1;15;85-87;"You used to teach me how man makes himself Eternal; and how grateful I am for that, as long as I Live must be discerned in my language.";durling
1;15;88-90;What you narrate about my path I am writing Down and keeping to be glossed, with other texts, by A lady who will know, if I reach her.;durling

1;15;112-114;Him who by the Servant of servants was Transmuted from Arno to Bacchiglione, where he Left his ill-protended muscles.;durling
1;15;115-117;I would say more, but my walking and my speech Can last no longer, for I see new smoke rising from the Sand over there.;durling
1;15;118-120;People are coming with whom I must not be. Let My Treasure be commended to you, in which I live Still, and I ask no more.”;durling
1;15;121-123;"Then he turned back, and he seemed one of those Who at Verona race for the green cloth across the Fields; and of those he seemed";durling
1;15;124-124;The one who wins, not the one who loses.;durling
1;16;1-3;Already I was in a place where one heard the Thundering of the water falling into the next circle, Like the rumbling that beehives make,;durling
1;16;4-6;When three shades came running together out of a Herd passing by beneath the rain of the harsh Punishment.;durling
1;16;7-9;They were coming toward us, and each was Shouting: “Stop, you who by your clothes seem to be Someone from our depraved city.”;durling
1;16;10-12;Alas, what wounds I saw in their members, recent And old, burned into them by the flames! It still pains Me when I remember.;durling
1;16;13-15;"At their shouts my teacher paused; he turned his Face toward me and: “Now wait,” he said, “to these We should be courteous.";durling
1;16;16-18;And if it were not for the fire that the nature of The place pours down, I would say that haste would More become you than them.”;durling
1;16;19-21;"When we stood still, they began again their Former verse; and on reaching us they made a wheel Of themselves, all three.";durling
1;16;22-24;As is the custom of wrestlers, naked and oiled, Spying out their holds and their advantage before They come to blows and wounds:;durling
1;16;25-27;So they wheeled, and each kept his face toward Me, so that their necks made a constant motion Contrary to their feet.;durling
1;16;28-30;And: “If the wretchedness of this vile place brings Us and our prayers to scorn,” one began, “and our Darkened, scorched appearance,;durling
1;16;31-33;Let our fame incline your spirit to tell us who you Are, who so confidently step with your living feet Through Hell.;durling
1;16;34-36;This man, in whose steps you see me tread, Though he now goes naked and hairless, was of Higher degree than you believe:;durling
1;16;37-39;"He was the grandson of the good Gualdrada; Guido Guerra was his name, and in his life he Accomplished much with wisdom and the sword.";durling
1;16;40-42;The other, who wears the sand behind me, is Tegghiaio Aldobrandi, whose words should have been More pleasing in the world above.;durling
1;16;43-45;And I, placed on the cross with them, was Iacopo Rusticucci, and certainly my fierce wife harms me More than anything else.”;durling
1;16;46-48;"If I had been protected from the fire, I would have Thrown myself down there among them, and I Believe my teacher would have suffered it;";durling
1;16;49-51;But because I would have burned and cooked Myself, fear vanquished the good will that made me Greedy to embrace them.;durling
1;16;52-54;Then I began: “Not scorn, but grief was fixed in Me by your condition, so great that it will long Endure,;durling
1;16;55-57;As soon as my lord here said words that made me Think people such as yourselves were coming.;durling
1;16;58-60;I am from your city, and always your works and Your honored names I have repeated and heard with Affection.;durling
1;16;61-63;"I am leaving the bitter and seek the sweet fruit Promised me by my truthful leader; but first I must Plunge as far as the center.”";durling
1;16;64-66;“So may your soul long guide your body,” he Replied then, “and so may your fame shine after you, ;durling
1;16;67-69;Tell if courtesy and valor dwell in our city as they Used to do, or if they have utterly forsaken it:;durling
1;16;70-72;For Guiglielmo Borsiere, who has been grieving With us but a short time and goes there with our Companions, causes us much pain with his words About it.”;durling
1;16;73-75;“The new people and the rapid gains have Generated pride and excess, Florence, in you, so that You already weep for it.”;durling
1;16;76-78;"So I cried with face uplifted; and the three, who Took that as my reply, looked at each other as one Looks at the truth.";durling
1;16;79-81;“If at other times it costs you so little,” they all Replied, “to satisfy others, happy are you, if you Speak so readily!;durling
1;16;82-84;Therefore, if you escape these dark places and go Back to see the beautiful stars, when it will be Pleasant to say, ‘I was,’;durling
1;16;85-87;See that you speak of us to people.” Then They broke the wheel, and their quick legs seemed Wings to their flight.;durling
1;16;88-90;"An amen could not be said more quickly than They disappeared; so my master judged we should Move on.";durling
1;16;91-93;I was following him, and we had not walked far, When the sound of the water was so close to us that We could hardly have heard each other speak.;durling
1;16;94-96;Like that river which is first to take its own course Toward the east, after Monte Viso, on the left side of The Apennines,;durling
1;16;97-99;Which is called Acquacheta above, before it falls Down into the low bed and loses that name at Forli,;durling
1;16;100-102;As it thunders there above San Benedetto de L’Alpe, when falling in one cascade where it usually Descends by a thousand:;durling
1;16;103-105;So down from a steep cliff we found that dark Water resounding, such that in a short while it would Have harmed our ears.;durling
1;16;106-108;I had a cord girding me, and with it I had thought At times to capture the leopard with the spotted hide.;durling
1;16;109-111;After I had untied it from around me, as my Leader had commanded me, I held it out to him Knotted and wound.;durling
1;16;112-114;And he turned toward his right side and Somewhat far from the bank threw it down into that Deep pit.;durling
1;16;115-117;“Some new thing must answer,” I was saying to Myself, “the strange sign that my master is following With his eyes.”;durling
1;16;118-120;Ah, how cautious men should be in the presence Of those who not only see our actions but with their Wisdom see our inner thoughts!;durling
1;16;121-123;"He said to me: “Soon what I expect, what your Thoughts are dreaming, will come up; soon it will be Revealed to your sight.”";durling
1;16;124-126;"Always to that truth which has the face of Falsehood one should close one’s lips as long as one Can, for without any guilt it brings shame;";durling
1;16;127-129;But here I cannot conceal it, and by the notes of This comedy, reader, I swear to you, so may they not Fail to find long favor,;durling
1;16;130-132;That I saw, through that thick dark air, a figure Come swimming upward, fearful to the most Confident heart,;durling
1;16;133-135;As one returns who at times goes down to release An anchor caught on a rock or other thing hidden in The sea,;durling
1;16;136-136;And reaches upward as he draws in his feet.;durling
1;17;1-3;“Behold the beast with the pointed tail, that passes Through mountains and pierces walls and armor! Behold the one that makes the whole world stink!”;durling
1;17;4-6;"So my leader began speaking to me; and he Gestured to it to come ashore near the end of our Marble pathway.";durling
1;17;7-9;And that filthy image of fraud came over and Beached its head and chest, but did not draw up its Tail as far as the bank.;durling
1;17;10-12;"Its face was that of a just man, so kindly seemed Its outer skin, and the rest of its torso was that of a Serpent;";durling
1;17;13-15;"It had two paws, hairy to the armpits; it had back And breast and both sides painted with knots and Little wheels:";durling
1;17;16-18;With more colors, in weave and embroidery, did Never Tartars nor Turks make cloths, nor did Arachne string the loom for such tapestries.;durling
1;17;19-21;As skiffs lie on the shore at times, partly in water And partly on land, and as there among the drunken Germans;durling
1;17;22-24;The beaver positions itself to wage its war: so the Wicked beast rested on the rim of stone that encloses The sand.;durling
1;17;25-27;In the emptiness all its tail was wriggling, twisting Upward the poisoned fork that armed its tip like a Scorpion’s.;durling
1;17;28-30;My leader said: “Now our path must bend a little Toward the evil beast that lies over there.”;durling
1;17;31-33;Therefore we descended toward the right breast And made ten paces to the edge, to be well beyond The sand and the flames.;durling
1;17;34-36;And when we had reached it, a little further, on The sand, I see people sitting near the empty place.;durling
1;17;37-39;There my master said to me: “That you may carry Away full experience of this subcircle, go, and see Their behavior.;durling
1;17;40-42;"Let your speech there be brief; until you return, I Will speak with this beast, that it may grant us its Strong shoulders.”";durling
1;17;43-45;So once more along the outer edge of that seventh Circle I walked all alone, where the mournful people Were sitting.;durling
1;17;46-48;"Through their eyes burst forth their pain; here, There, they sought remedy with their hands at times Against the fire, at times against the hot ground;";durling
1;17;49-51;Not otherwise do the dogs behave in the summer, Now with muzzle, now with foot, when they are Bitten by fleas or gnats or horseflies.;durling
1;17;52-54;"When I turned my eyes to their faces, on which The painful fire falls down, I recognized none; but I Perceived";durling
1;17;55-57;That from the neck of each hung a bag of a special Color, with a special emblem, and their eyes seem to Feed there.;durling
1;17;58-60;And as I come gazing among them, on a yellow Purse I saw blue that had the shape and bearing of a Lion.;durling
1;17;61-63;Then, proceeding further with my scrutiny, I saw Another, red as blood, displaying a goose whiter than Butter.;durling
1;17;64-66;And one who had his little white sack signed with A fat blue sow, said to me: “What are you doing in This ditch?;durling
1;17;67-69;"Now go away; and since you are alive, too, know That my neighbor Vitaliano will sit here at my left Flank.";durling
1;17;70-72;With these Florentines I am a Paduan: often they Thunder in my ears shouting, ‘Let the reigning knight Come down,;durling
1;17;73-75;Who will bring the bag with the three goats.’” Here He twisted his mouth and stuck out his tongue, like an Ox licking its snout.;durling
1;17;76-78;And I, fearing lest a longer stay might displease Him who had warned me to be brief, turned back, Away from those weary souls.;durling
1;17;79-81;I found my leader had climbed already onto the Fierce animal’s rump, and he told me: “Now be strong And bold:;durling
1;17;82-84;Henceforth we descend by stairs like these. Mount In front, for I wish to be between, so that its tail Can do no harm.”;durling
1;17;85-87;Like one whose fit of the quartan fever is so close That his nails are already pale and he trembles all Over merely looking at the shade:;durling
1;17;88-90;"So I became at the words I heard; but shame made Its threats, that makes a servant bold in the presence Of a good lord.";durling
1;17;91-93;"I positioned myself on those monstrous shoulders; “Yes,” I wanted to say, but my voice did not come as I Expected: “Be sure to hold me.”";durling
1;17;94-96;"But he, who had supported me at other times, in Other dangers, as soon as I mounted clasped and Braced me with his arms;";durling
1;17;97-99;"And he said: “Geryon, now move; make your Wheelings large, your descent slow: consider the new Weight you carry.”";durling
1;17;100-102;"As a little boat moves from its place backward, Backward, so he moved thence; and when he felt Himself entirely free,";durling
1;17;103-105;He turned his tail where his breast had been, and, Extending it, he moved it like an eel’s, and gathered The air to himself with his paws.;durling
1;17;106-108;I believe there was no greater fear when Phaéthon Abandoned the reins, so that the sky was scorched, as Still appears,;durling
1;17;109-111;Nor when the wretched Icarus felt his loins Unfeathering because of the heated wax, as his father Shouted to him, “You’re on a bad course!”;durling
1;17;112-114;Than was mine, when I saw that I was in the air On every side, and every sight put out save that of The beast.;durling
1;17;115-117;"It goes along swimming slowly, slowly; it wheels And descends, but I perceive its motion only by the Wind on my face from below.";durling
1;17;118-120;I could already hear at my right hand the torrent Making a horrible roar beneath us, and so I lean out My head, looking down.;durling
1;17;121-123;"Then I became more afraid of falling, for I saw Fires and heard weeping; so that all trembling I Huddled back.";durling
1;17;124-126;And then I saw what I had not seen before, our Descending and turning against the great evils that Came closer on every side.;durling
1;17;127-129;As when a falcon has been long on the wing and, Without seeing lure or prey, makes the falconer say, “Oh me, you are coming down!”;durling
1;17;130-132;Descending weary to the place it swiftly left, with A hundred circlings, and lands far from its master, Full of disdain and spite:;durling
1;17;133-135;So Geryon placed us on the bottom, at the very Foot of the vertical rock, and, our persons unloaded, ;durling
1;17;136-136;Disappeared like the notch from the bowstring.;durling
1;18;1-3;There is in Hell a place called Malebolge, made of Stone the color of iron, like the circle that encloses it. ;durling
1;18;4-6;In the exact center of the evil field there gapes a Broad, deep pit, whose fashion I will tell suo loco.;durling
1;18;7-9;The belt that remains, then, is round, between the Pit and the foot of the high hard bank, and its Bottom is divided into ten valleys.;durling
1;18;10-12;As, where to guard the walls many moats gird Castles, their placing traces a pattern: ;durling
1;18;13-15;"Such an image these valleys made there; and as From the thresholds of such fortresses bridges lead to The outside bank:";durling
1;18;16-18;So, from the base of the cliff, ridges moved that Cut across the banks and the ditches, as far as the pit That truncates and gathers them in.;durling
1;18;19-21;"In this place, shaken from Geryon’s back, we Found ourselves; and my poet moved toward the left, And I followed him.";durling
1;18;22-24;On my right hand I saw new cause for pity, new Torments and new wielders of the whip, of which the first Pocket was full.;durling
1;18;25-27;"At the bottom were the sinners, naked; on this side Of the midpoint they came with their faces toward Us, on the other side they went with us, but with longer Steps:";durling
1;18;28-30;As the Romans, the year of the Jubilee, because of The great throng, found a way to move people across The bridge,;durling
1;18;31-33;For on one side they are all turned toward the Castle and are going toward Saint Peter, and on the Other they are going toward the mountain.;durling
1;18;34-36;Here and there, along the dark rock, I saw horned Demons with great whips, who were beating them From behind.;durling
1;18;37-39;Ah, how the first blow made each lift his heels! None waited for the second or the third.;durling
1;18;40-42;"As I was walking, my eye fell on one; immediately I said: “I am certainly not fasting for sight of him.”";durling
1;18;43-45;"And so I stopped my pace to make out his Features; and my sweet leader stopped with me and Consented that I walk a little backward.";durling
1;18;46-48;"And that whipped one thought to hide by Lowering his face; but it little availed him, for I said: “O you who cast your eyes to the earth,";durling
1;18;49-51;If your features are not false, you are Venedico Caccianemico. But what leads you to such pungent Sauces?”;durling
1;18;52-54;And he to me: “Unwilling I say it, but your clear Speech compels me, reminding me of the former World.;durling
1;18;55-57;It was I who induced Ghisolabella to do the Marchese’s will, however they tell the shameful tale.;durling
1;18;58-60;And not only I weep here from Bologna, for this Place is so full of us that not so many tongues have Learned;durling
1;18;61-63;"To say sipa now between the Savena and the Reno; and if you want proof or testimony of that, Bring to mind our greedy breast.”";durling
1;18;64-66;As he was speaking a demon struck him with his Scourge, and said: “Away, pimp! here there are no Females to coin.”;durling
1;18;67-69;"I caught up with my guide; then after a few steps We came to where a ridge went out from the bank.";durling
1;18;70-72;Easily we climbed it, and, turning to the right Along its spine, we left those eternal circlings.;durling
1;18;73-75;When we were above where it gapes to give Passage to the whipped ones, my leader said: “Wait, And let ;durling
1;18;76-78;the sight Of these other ill-born ones strike you, many of Whose faces you have not seen, since they have Walked together with us.”;durling
1;18;79-81;From the old bridge we looked down on the file That was coming toward us on the other side, Likewise driven by the lash.;durling
1;18;82-84;And my good master, without my asking, said: “Look at that tall one coming, who does not seem to Be shedding any tears for the pain:;durling
1;18;85-87;How regal is his bearing still! That is Jason, who By courage and wit robbed the Colchians of the ram.;durling
1;18;88-90;He visited the island of Lemnos after the bold, Pitiless women had put all their males to death.;durling
1;18;91-93;There with tokens and elaborate words he Deceived Hypsipyle, the young girl who, before that, Had deceived all the other women.;durling
1;18;94-96;He left her there pregnant and alone: such guilt Condemns him to this punishment, and also for Medea vengeance is taken.;durling
1;18;97-99;"Those walk with him who deceive in that Direction; and let this be enough to know about the First ditch and those it grinds in its teeth.”";durling
1;18;100-102;Already we had come to where the narrow Passage intersects the second bank and makes of it The support for another arch.;durling
1;18;103-105;From there we heard people whimpering in the Next pocket, and puffing with their snouts, and Striking themselves with their palms.;durling
1;18;106-108;The banks were encrusted with a mold from the Breath from below that condenses there, which Assailed both eyes and nose.;durling
1;18;109-111;The bottom is so deep that no vantage point is Sufficient without climbing on the back of the arch, Where the ridge is highest.;durling
1;18;112-114;"There we came; and from there I saw, down in the Ditch, people immersed in dung that seemed to have Come from human privies.";durling
1;18;115-117;And while I am searching with my eyes down There, I saw one with his head so filthy with shit that Whether he was lay or clerk did not show.;durling
1;18;118-120;He scolded me: “Why are you so hungry to look More at me than the other filthy ones?” And I to him: “Because, if I recall well,;durling
1;18;121-123;"I have seen you before with dry hair, and you are Alessio Interminei of Lucca; therefore I eye you more Than all the others.”";durling
1;18;124-126;And he again, beating his noggin: “I am Submerged down here by the flatteries with which My tongue was never cloyed.”;durling
1;18;127-129;After that, my leader told me: “See that you push Your eye a little further on, so that it attains the face ;durling
1;18;130-132;Of that filthy baggage with disordered hair who Is scratching herself with her shitty nails, now Squatting, now standing on her feet:;durling
1;18;133-135;That is Thais, the whore who, when he said, ‘Do I Find great favor with you?’ replied to her lover: ‘Marvelous favor indeed!’;durling
1;18;136-136;And therewith let our eyes be sated.”;durling
1;19;1-3;O Simon Magus, O wretched followers, you who The things of God, that should be brides of goodness, Rapaciously;durling
1;19;4-6;Adulterate for gold and for silver, now the trumpet Must sound for you, because you are in the third Pocket.;durling
1;19;7-9;We had already climbed to that part of the ridge That is exactly above the center of the next tomb.;durling
1;19;10-12;O highest Wisdom, how great is the art you show In the heavens, on earth, and in the evil world, and How justly your Power distributes!;durling
1;19;13-15;I saw, along the sides and the bottom, the livid Rock perforated with holes, all of the same size, and Each was round.;durling
1;19;16-18;"They seemed no less ample, nor greater, than Those in my lovely San Giovanni, made as places for The baptizers;";durling
1;19;19-21;One of which, not many years ago, I broke because Of one drowning inside it: and let this be a seal to Undeceive all men.;durling
1;19;22-24;From the mouth of each protruded the feet and Legs of a sinner, as far as the thighs, and the rest was Inside.;durling
1;19;25-27;"All of them had both soles aflame; therefore they Wriggled their joints so violently that they would Have broken twisted withes or braided ropes.";durling
1;19;28-30;As the flaming of oily things moves over just the Outer rind: so did it there from heel to toes.;durling
1;19;31-33;“Who is that one, master, who shows the torture By wriggling more than his other companions,” I Said, “and whom a ruddier flame sucks at?”;durling
1;19;34-36;And he to me: “If you wish me to carry you there, Down the bank that is less steep, from him you will Learn of him and his wrongs.”;durling
1;19;37-39;And I: “So much is pleasant to me as pleases you: You are my lord, you know that I do not depart from Your will, and you know what I leave unsaid.”;durling
1;19;40-42;"Then we came to the fourth bank; we turned and Descended to the left, down there into the narrow, Perforated ditch.";durling
1;19;43-45;My good master did not put me down from his Hip until we reached the place of him who was Weeping so with his shanks.;durling
1;19;46-48;“O whatever you are, you who hold your upside Down, sorrowing soul, planted like a pole,” I began Speaking, “if you can, say a word.”;durling
1;19;49-51;I was standing like the friar that confesses the Treacherous assassin who, once he is fixed in the Earth, calls him back so as to put off his death.;durling
1;19;52-54;And he cried out: “Are you already standing There, are you already standing there, Boniface? The Writing lied to me by several years.;durling
1;19;55-57;Are you so soon sated by the wealth for which You did not fear to marry the lovely lady Fraudulently, and then to tear her apart?”;durling
1;19;58-60;I became like those who, not understanding what Is said to them, stand as if mocked, at a loss for a Reply.;durling
1;19;61-63;Then Virgil said: “Tell him quickly, ‘I am not he, I Am not he you suppose,” and I replied as was Commanded me.;durling
1;19;64-66;"Therefore the spirit twisted its feet; next, sighing, Its voice full of tears, it said to me: “Then what do You want from me?";durling
1;19;67-69;"If it matters so much to know who I am, that just For this you have run down the bank, know that I Was clothed in the great mantle;";durling
1;19;70-72;And truly I was a son of the she-bear, so greedy to Advance her cubs, that I pocketed wealth up there, And myself down here.;durling
1;19;73-75;Beneath my head are driven the others who Preceded me in simony, squeezed into the cracks of The rock.;durling
1;19;76-78;I, too, will fall down there, when he comes who I Believed you to be, when I asked my sudden Question.;durling
1;19;79-81;But it has been a longer time that my feet have Burned and that I have been upside-down like this, Than he will be planted with red feet:;durling

1;19;85-87;"He will be a new Jason, like the one we read of in Maccabees; and as his king was indulgent to the first One, so the ruler of France will be to him.”";durling
1;19;88-90;I do not know if here I became too rash, but I Replied to him in this meter: “Ah, now tell me: how Much treasure did;durling

1;19;118-120;And while I was singing these notes to him, Whether it was anger or conscience that was biting Him, he kicked violently with both his feet.;durling
1;19;121-123;I firmly believe that it pleased my leader, with Such a contented smile he listened still to the sound Of the true words I spoke.;durling
1;19;124-126;"Therefore with both arms he seized me; and when He had lifted me up to his breast, he climbed back up By the way he had come down.";durling
1;19;127-129;Nor did he tire of holding me embraced, but Carried me to the top of the arch that gives passage From the fourth to the fifth bank.;durling
1;19;130-132;There he gently put his burden down, gently on The rough, steep ridge, which even for she-goats Would be a difficult crossing.;durling
1;19;133-133;From there another valley was revealed to me.;durling
1;20;1-3;Of a strange new punishment I must make verses And take matter for the twentieth song in this first Canticle, which is of those submerged.;durling
1;20;4-6;"I was already bent over to gaze into the Uncovered depth, which was bathed with anguished Weeping;";durling
1;20;7-9;And I saw people coming along the curving valley, Silent and shedding tears, at the pace taken by litanies In this world.;durling
1;20;10-12;As my gaze went lower on them, I saw that each Was marvelously twisted between the chin and the Beginning of the chest,;durling
1;20;13-15;For the face was turned toward the kidneys, and They were forced to walk backwards, since seeing Forward was taken from them.;durling
1;20;16-18;Perhaps the force of paralysis at some time has Contorted someone so completely, but I have never Seen it, nor do I believe it can be.;durling
1;20;19-21;So may God permit you, reader, to take profit From your reading, now think for yourself how I Could keep dry eyes,;durling
1;20;22-24;When from close by I saw our image so twisted That the tears of their eyes were bathing their buttocks Down the cleft.;durling
1;20;25-27;Surely I wept, leaning on one of the rocks of the Hard ridge, so that my guide said to me: “Are you Still one of the other fools?;durling
1;20;28-30;Here pity lives when it is quite dead: who is more Wicked than one who brings passion to God’s Judgment?;durling
1;20;31-33;Raise your head, raise it and see the one for Whom the earth opened before the eyes of the Thebans, so that they all cried: ‘Where are you Rushing,;durling
1;20;34-36;Amphiaraus? Why are you leaving the war?’ And He did not stop falling downward until he reached Minos, who seizes each one.;durling
1;20;37-39;"Look how he has made his breast his back; Because he wished to see too far ahead, now he looks Backward and treads a backward path.";durling
1;20;40-42;"See Tiresias, who changed shape when he turned From male to female, changing all his members, every One;";durling

1;20;46-48;"Arruns is the one who backs up against his belly There; in the mountains of Luni, where the Carrarese Hoes, who lives below,";durling
1;20;49-51;He had a cave in the white marble for his Dwelling, whence the view of the stars and the sea Was not cut off.;durling
1;20;52-54;And she who covers up her breasts, which you Cannot see, with her loosened tresses, and has every Hairy skin on the other side,;durling
1;20;55-57;"Was Manto, who searched through many lands; Finally she settled where I was born; therefore I wish You to listen for a little.";durling
1;20;58-60;After her father departed from life, and the city of Bacchus was enslaved, for a long time she wandered Through the world.;durling
1;20;61-63;Up in beautiful Italy there lies a lake, at the foot Of the Alps that close in Germany above the Tyrol, Whose name is Benaco.;durling
1;20;64-66;A thousand springs, I think, and more, bathe the Land between Garda and Val Camonica and the Alps, With the water that collects in that lake.;durling
1;20;67-69;In the center there is a place where the shepherds Of Trento and Brescia, and the Veronese, could all Give blessing, if they made the journey.;durling
1;20;70-72;Peschiera sits there, a handsome, strong fortress, To hold the front against the Brescians and the Bergamasques, where the shore around it is lowest.;durling
1;20;73-75;There must fall whatever cannot stay in Benaco, Becoming a river through green fields.;durling
1;20;76-78;As soon as the water begins to flow, it is no Longer called Benaco but Mincio, as far as Governolo, Where it falls into the Po.;durling
1;20;79-81;"It has not flowed far before finding a depression In which it spreads out and becomes a swamp; and In the summer it is often noxious.";durling
1;20;82-84;Passing there the harsh virgin saw land in the Midst of the fens, uncultivated and bare of people.;durling
1;20;85-87;There, to flee all human fellowship, with her Servants she stayed to ply her arts, there lived, and There left her empty body.;durling
1;20;88-90;The people who were scattered about later Gathered to that spot, which the swamp in all Directions made strong.;durling
1;20;91-93;"They built their city over those dead bones; and, After her who first chose the place, they named it Mantua without any other augury.";durling
1;20;94-96;The people housed there used to be more Numerous, before the fool of Casalodi was deceived By Pinamonte.;durling
1;20;97-99;Therefore I advise you, if you ever hear any other Origin given for my city, that you let no lie defraud The truth.”;durling
1;20;100-102;And I: “Master, your discourse is so sure and so Gains my belief, that any others would be spent coals To me.;durling
1;20;103-105;"But among the people in this procession, tell me if You see any worthy of note; for my mind still comes Back to that alone.”";durling
1;20;106-108;Then he told me: “That one, who from his cheek Spreads his beard down over his dark shoulders, was —when Greece was emptied of males,;durling
1;20;109-111;So that hardly any remained in the cradles—an Augur, and along with Calchas he determined the Point to cut the first ship’s cable in Aulis.;durling

1;20;115-117;That other who is so slender in the flanks was Michael Scot, who truly knew the game of magic Frauds.;durling
1;20;118-120;"See Guido Bonatti; see Asdente, who now wishes He had attended to his leather and his thread, but Repents too late.";durling
1;20;121-123;"See the wretched women who left their needles, their Spindles, and their distaffs, and became soothsayers; They cast spells with herbs and images.";durling
1;20;124-126;"But come along now, for Cain with his thorns now Holds the boundary of the two hemispheres and Touches the wave below Seville;";durling
1;20;127-129;And already last night the moon was full: you Must remember it well, for several times it did not Harm you in the deep forest.”;durling
1;20;130-130;So he spoke to me, and we walked meanwhile.;durling
1;21;1-3;"Thus we went from bridge to bridge, speaking of Other things my comedy does not record; and we Were at the summit when";durling
1;21;4-6;"We stood still to see the next cleft of Malebolge And the next vain weeping; and I saw it to be Wondrously dark.";durling
1;21;7-9;As in the Venetians’ arsenal in winter the Tenacious pitch boils to recaulk their worn ships,;durling
1;21;10-12;" For they cannot sail; instead this man works on a New ship, that one plugs the ribs of a craft that has Made many voyages,";durling
1;21;13-15;This one repairs at the prow, this one at the stern, Another makes oars, another twists shrouds, another Patches foresail and mainsail:;durling
1;21;16-18;So, heated not by fire but by God’s art, a thick Pitch boiled there that clung to the banks on every Side.;durling
1;21;19-21;I saw it, but in it I saw nothing but the bubbles That the boiling brought up, and the pitch all swelling Out and subsiding deflated.;durling
1;21;22-24;While I was gazing fixedly down at it, my leader, Saying: “Look out, look out!” drew me from where I Was standing.;durling
1;21;25-27;Then I turned, like one eager to see what he must Escape, whom sudden fear robs of vigor, ;durling
1;21;28-30;"And, though he looks, does not delay departure; And I saw behind us a black devil running along the Ridge.";durling
1;21;31-33;Ah, how fierce he looked! and how cruel his Bearing seemed to me with his opened wings, so Light on his feet!;durling
1;21;34-36;His shoulder, which was sharp and high, was Loaded down with a sinner’s two hips, and he held Hooked with his claw the sinews of both feet.;durling
1;21;37-39;From our bridge he said: “O Evil Claws, here is One of the elders of Santa Zita! Put him under, I am Going back for more ;durling
1;21;40-42;"To that city, which is well supplied with them: Every one is a grafter there, except Bonturo; for Money there they turn ‘no’ into ‘yes.’”";durling
1;21;43-45;"He threw him down and turned on the stony Ridge; and never was a mastiff loosed with more Haste to pursue a thief.";durling
1;21;46-48;The sinner plunged, and came back to the surface Bottom up: but the demons hidden beneath the Bridge cried: “Here we don’t show the Holy Face!;durling
1;21;49-51;Here the swimming is different than in the Serchio! So, if you don’t want to feel our grapples, Don’t protrude above the pitch.”;durling
1;21;52-54;After they made him feel the teeth of a hundred Prongs, they said: “Down here you have to dance Covered up and, if you can, grab secretly.”;durling
1;21;55-57;Not otherwise do cooks have their servants push Down with hooks the meat cooking in a broth, so That it may not float.;durling
1;21;58-60;"My good master said to me: “So it may not appear That you are here, squat down behind a projecting Rock to hide;";durling
1;21;61-63;"And no matter what harm they offer me, do not You be afraid, for I have foreseen everything; I have Already been present at these deals.”";durling
1;21;64-66;"Then he passed beyond the bridgehead; and as he Reached the sixth bank, he needed to have a Confident brow.";durling
1;21;67-69;With the fury and tempestuous noise of dogs Coming out at a poor man, who stops and begs from Where he stands,;durling
1;21;70-72;"So they came forth from under the bridge, and Pointed all their grappling hooks toward him; but he Cried: “Let none of you think to harm!";durling
1;21;73-75;Before your hooks seize me, let one of you come Forward to hear me, and then you may take counsel To grapplehook me.”;durling
1;21;76-78;All cried: “Let Evil Tail go!” and one stepped Forth while the others stood still, and came to Virgil, Saying, “What good will it do him?”;durling
1;21;79-81;“Do you think, Evil Tail, that you see me here,” Said my master, “once already safe from all your tricks, ;durling
1;21;82-84;Without God’s will and favorable fate? Allow us To walk on, for it is willed in Heaven that I guide Someone on this savage journey.”;durling
1;21;85-87;Then his pride fell so that he let his hook droop to His feet, and he said to the others: “Now he mustn’t Be gored.”;durling
1;21;88-90;And my leader to me: “O you, sitting among the Rocks of the bridge all asquat, you can return to me Safely now.”;durling
1;21;91-93;"Therefore I moved and went to him swiftly; and The devils all started forward, so that I was afraid They would not keep the pact:";durling
1;21;94-96;Thus once I saw the foot-soldiers fear, coming out Of Caprona under safe-conduct, seeing themselves Among so many enemies.;durling
1;21;97-99;I drew close to my leader with all my person, and I did not turn my eyes from their expression, which Was not good.;durling
1;21;100-102;They pointed their prongs, and: “Want me to Nudge him,” one said to the other, “on the rump?” And they replied: “Yes, give it to him in the notch.”;durling
1;21;103-105;But that demon who was parleying with my Leader, turned swiftly about, saying, “Down, down, Tangle Head!”;durling
1;21;106-108;Then he said to us: “Further along this ridge you Cannot go, for the sixth arch lies all shattered at the Bottom.;durling
1;21;109-111;But if you still wish to go forward, walk along this Bank: nearby is another ridge that makes a path.;durling
1;21;112-114;Yesterday, five hours later than now, one Thousand two hundred and sixty-six years were Completed since the way was broken here.;durling
1;21;115-117;I am sending some of these in that direction, to See if anyone is airing himself: go with them, they Will not be troublesome.”;durling
1;21;118-120;"“Come forward, Harlequin, Trample Frost,” he Began to say, “and you, Evil Dog; and Curly Beard Command the squad.";durling
1;21;121-123;Love Notch, come here, and Little Big Dragon, Big Pig with his tusks, and Scratching Dog, and Butterfly And Crazy Ruby Face.;durling
1;21;124-126;"Inspect the boiling birdlime; let these be safe until The next ridge that goes undamaged over the pits.”";durling
1;21;127-129;"“Oh me, master, what do I see?” I said, “Ah, let us Go alone, without escort, if you know the way; I Don’t ask it for myself.";durling
1;21;130-132;If you are as alert as usual, don’t you see how They are grinding their teeth, and how their eyebrows Threaten treachery?”;durling
1;21;133-135;And he to me: “I would not have you fear: let Them snarl as much as they please, they are doing That for the sufferers in the stew.”;durling
1;21;136-138;"They made left face on the bank; but first each Had bit his tongue toward their leader, as a salute, ";durling
1;21;139-139;And he of his ass had made a trumpet.;durling
1;22;1-3;"I have seen knights setting forth, beginning Assaults and standing muster, and sometimes Retreating to save themselves;";durling
1;22;4-6;I have seen mounted men coursing your city, O Aretines, I have seen foragers riding, tournaments Striking, and jousts running,;durling
1;22;7-9;Sometimes with trumpets, sometimes with bells, With drums or signals from the tower, with things Both our own and foreign:;durling
1;22;10-12;But never at so strange a pipe have I seen Horsemen or foot-soldiers setting forth, nor a ship at A sign from land or star.;durling
1;22;13-15;We were walking with the ten demons. Ah, fierce Company! but in church with the saints, in the tavern With the gluttons.;durling
1;22;16-18;My attention was all given to the pitch, to see Every condition of the moat and of the people burned In it.;durling
1;22;19-21;As dolphins do, when they signal to sailors, Arching their spines, to take measures to save their Ship:;durling
1;22;22-24;So from time to time, to lessen the pain, a sinner Would show his back and hide it in less than a flash.;durling
1;22;25-27;And as at the edge of a ditch the bullfrogs sit with Only their snouts showing, hiding their feet and thick Bodies:;durling
1;22;28-30;So on every side did the sinners, but as Curly Beard came near, like frogs they withdrew into the Boiling.;durling
1;22;31-33;"I saw one wait, and my heart still makes me Shudder at it, as sometimes one frog stays while the Other jumps;";durling
1;22;34-36;And Scratching Dog, who was closest, hooked his Grapple in his pitchy locks and drew him up, so that He seemed to me like an otter.;durling
1;22;37-39;I had learned all their names, they made such an Impression on me when they were chosen and when They called to each other.;durling
1;22;40-42;“O Ruby Face, see that you get your nails in him And tear his skin off!” all those cursed ones were Shouting at once.;durling
1;22;43-45;And I: “My master, see if you can discover who This wretch is who has come into the hands of his Enemies.”;durling
1;22;46-48;"My master stood alongside him; he asked him Where he was from, and he replied: “I was born in The kingdom of Navarre.";durling
1;22;49-51;"My mother placed me in the service of a lord; she Had generated me by a wastrel, destroyer of his Wealth and of himself.";durling
1;22;52-54;"Then I was in the household of good king Thibaut; and there I took to barratry, for which I Square accounts in this heat.”";durling
1;22;55-57;And Big Pig, from whose mouth on each side Came a tusk like a boar’s, let him feel how one of Them could rip.;durling
1;22;58-60;"Among bad cats had the mouse arrived; but Curly Beard enclosed him with his arms, and said: “Stay Over there, while I have him gripped.”";durling
1;22;61-63;"Then he turned his face toward my master; “Ask Again,” he said, “if you want to know more from him Before someone does him in.”";durling
1;22;64-66;My leader therefore: “Now say: among the other Sinners under the pitch, do you know any who is Italian?” And he: “I left one,;durling
1;22;67-69;A moment ago, who was from near there. Would I were still hidden with him, I’d not fear claw or Crook!”;durling
1;22;70-72;And Love Notch said: “We've been patient too Long,” and he hooked one arm with his pruning knife And pulled, tearing out a muscle.;durling
1;22;73-75;"Little Big Dragon, too, wanted to hook him below, At the legs; at which their decurion whirled about With an evil look.";durling
1;22;76-78;When they had quieted down a little, without Delay my master asked the soul, who was still gazing At his wound:;durling
1;22;79-81;“Who was he you say you should not have left for The shore?” and he replied, “It was Brother Gomita, The one from Gallura, vessel of every fraud, who;durling
1;22;82-84;Had his master’s enemies in his hand and treated Them so that each is thankful to him:;durling
1;22;85-87;"He took their money and let them go scot free, as He tells it; and in his other duties, too, he was not a Small barrator, but a champion.";durling
1;22;88-90;"Master Michel Zanche of Logodoro keeps Company with him; and their tongues never tire of Speaking about Sardinia.";durling
1;22;91-93;"Oh me, look at this other one snarling; I would Say more, but I’m afraid he’s getting ready to scratch My scurf.”";durling
1;22;94-96;And the great officer, turning to Butterfly, whose Eyes were bulging to strike, said: “Get over there, Wicked bird!”;durling
1;22;97-99;"“If you want to see or hear,” the terrified wretch Began again, “Tuscans or Lombards, I can make them Come;";durling
1;22;100-102;"But let the Evil Claws stand a little apart, so they Won’t be frightened of their cruelty; and I, sitting Right here,";durling

1;22;106-108;At that Evil Dog lifted his snout, shaking his head, And said: “Listen to the trick he’s thought of, so he Can jump back in!”;durling
1;22;109-111;Therefore he, who had a great wealth of snares, Replied: “I am really very tricky, if I procure more Suffering for my own kind.”;durling
1;22;112-114;Harlequin could not hold back and, against the Others, told him: “If you go down, I won’t come after You at a gallop,;durling
1;22;115-117;But beating my wings above the pitch. Let’s leave The ridge and hide behind the bank, and we'll see if All by yourself you can outdo us.”;durling
1;22;118-120;O you who read, you will hear strange sport: each Of them turned his eyes toward the other bank, and He first who had been most unwilling.;durling
1;22;121-123;The Navarrese chose his moment well, planted his Feet on the ground, and in one point jumped and Escaped their design.;durling
1;22;124-126;"For that each felt the stab of guilt, but most of all He who had caused the fault; so he moved, crying: “You’re caught!”";durling
1;22;127-129;"But it did no good, for his wings could not Outspeed the other’s fear; the shade dove under, and He straightened his breast to fly back up:";durling

1;22;133-135;"Trample Frost, angered by the trick, was flying Just behind him, hoping the soul would escape, eager To have a scrap;";durling
1;22;136-138;And when the barrator had disappeared, he turned His talons against his fellow, and grappled with him Above the ditch.;durling
1;22;139-141;But the other was a full-grown hawk to grapple Him, and both of them fell into the boiling pool.;durling
1;22;142-144;"The heat was a quick ungrappler; but not for that Could they come forth, they had so enlimed their Wings.";durling
1;22;145-147;Curly Beard, grieving with his fellows, sent four Flying to the inner bank with their hooks, and quickly Enough,;durling
1;22;148-150;"On this side and on that, they flew to their posts; They held out their hooks toward the viscous ones, Who were already cooked within their crusts.";durling
1;22;151-151;And we left them thus entangled.;durling
1;23;1-3;Silent, alone, without companions, we were Walking one before, the other after, as friars minor Go their way.;durling
1;23;4-6;Because of the present scuffle, my thoughts had Turned to that fable by Aesop where he spoke of the Frog and the rat,;durling
1;23;7-9;For mo and issa are not more alike than the scuffle And the fable, if one couples beginning and end with Close attention.;durling
1;23;10-12;And, as one thought bursts out of another, so Another was born from that one, and it redoubled my Former fear.;durling
1;23;13-15;I considered: “These through us have suffered Shame with harm, and with mockery that I believe will Bitterly wound them.;durling
1;23;16-18;If anger is spooled onto their ill will, they will Come after us, crueler than a dog after the hare he Snaps at.”;durling
1;23;19-21;Already I felt all my hairs curling with fear, and I Kept looking back, when I said: “Master if you do not Hide;durling
1;23;22-24;"Yourself and me quickly, I am frightened of the Evil Claws. They are already behind us; I imagine Them so strongly, I already hear them.”";durling
1;23;25-27;And he: “If I were made of leaded glass I would Not catch your outer image any faster than I grasp Your inner one.;durling
1;23;28-30;Just now your thoughts came among mine, with Similar bearing and similar face, so that I have made A single counsel of them.;durling
1;23;31-33;If the right bank slopes so that we can go down Into the next pocket, we will escape the imagined Pursuit.”;durling
1;23;34-36;He had not finished giving this advice, when I Saw them coming, with outstretched wings, not far Away, intent on seizing us.;durling
1;23;37-39;My leader seized me quickly, like a mother who is Awakened by the noise and sees the flames burning Close by,;durling
1;23;40-42;Who takes up her son and flees, caring more for Him than for herself, not stopping even to put on her Shift:;durling
1;23;43-45;And down from the neck of the hard bank, he Gave himself supine to the sloping rock that encloses The near side of the next pocket.;durling
1;23;46-48;Water has never coursed more swiftly down a Sluice to turn the wheels of a land mill, as it Approaches the paddles,;durling
1;23;49-51;Than did my master down that wall, carrying Me along on his breast like his son, not his Companion.;durling
1;23;52-54;"Hardly had his feet touched the bed of the ditch, When the devils appeared on the bank above us; but Now there was nothing to fear,";durling
1;23;55-57;For the high Providence that placed them as Ministers of the fifth ditch takes from them all power To leave it.;durling
1;23;58-60;Down there we found a painted people who were Walking with very slow steps, weeping and, by their Expressions, weary and defeated.;durling
1;23;61-63;They were wearing robes with hoods pulled low Over their eyes, made in the fashion that is sewn in Cluny for the monks.;durling
1;23;64-66;On the outside they are dazzlingly gilded, but Within they are all of lead, so heavy that the ones Frederick put on people might have been of straw.;durling
1;23;67-69;Oh eternally laborious mantle! We turned once More to the left with them, attentive to their sad Weeping,;durling
1;23;70-72;But because of the weight those weary people came On so slowly that we had a new companion with Each motion of our hips.;durling
1;23;73-75;Therefore I said to my leader: “Try to find Someone known by deed or name, moving your eyes About as we walk.”;durling
1;23;76-78;And one who understood my Tuscan speech, Behind us, called: “Stay your feet, you who are Running so through the dark air!;durling
1;23;79-81;Perhaps you will have from me what you desire.” And so my leader turned and said: “Wait, and then Walk at his pace.”;durling
1;23;82-84;I stood still and saw two showing in their faces Great haste of the spirit to be with me, but their Burden slowed them, and the crowded way.;durling
1;23;85-87;"When they had reached me, for a long time they Looked at me sidelong, without saying a word; then They turned to each other and spoke together:";durling
1;23;88-90;"“That one seems alive, by the motion of his throat; But if they are dead, by what privilege are they Exempt from the weighty stole?”";durling
1;23;91-93;Then they spoke to me: “O Tuscan who have come To the college of the sad hypocrites, do not disdain to Say who you are.”;durling
1;23;94-96;And I to them: “I was born and raised beside the Lovely river Arno in the great city, and I am here With the body I have always had.;durling
1;23;97-99;But who are you, whose great pain distills all I see Trickling down your cheeks? and what punishment is In you that sparkles so?”;durling
1;23;100-102;And one replied: “The orange robes are so thick With lead that the weights make their balances creak.;durling
1;23;103-105;We were Jolly Friars, and from Bologna, I Named Catalano and he Loderingo, and taken both Together by your city,;durling
1;23;106-108;"Though the custom is to take a single man, to Preserve the peace; and we were such that it still Appears around the Gardingo.”";durling
1;23;109-111;I began: “O friars, your evil . . .” but I said no more, For into my view came one crucified to the earth with Three stakes.;durling
1;23;112-114;"When he saw me, he twisted himself all over, Puffing into his beard with sighs; and Brother Catalano, who perceived it,";durling
1;23;115-117;Told me: “That one staked there at whom you are Looking counseled the Pharisees that it was Expedient to put one man to death for the people.;durling
1;23;118-120;He is stretched naked out across the road, as you See, so that whoever passes, he must feel his weight first.;durling
1;23;121-123;And his father-in-law is laid out in the same way In this ditch, and the others of the council that sowed So ill for the Jews.”;durling
1;23;124-126;Then I saw Virgil marveling over him who was So basely stretched cross-wise in the eternal exile.;durling
1;23;127-129;Then he directed to the friar this word: “Let it not Displease you, if it is permitted, to tell us if on the Right hand some passage slopes;durling
1;23;130-132;Whereby we can both climb out of here, without Requiring any of the black angels to come to this Bottom to transport us.”;durling
1;23;133-135;So he replied: “Closer than you hope, we are Approaching a ridge that goes from the largest circle Across all the savage valleys,;durling
1;23;136-138;"Except that in this one it is broken and does not Cover it; you will be able to climb up along the Landslide, which slopes gently up the side and is Heaped up at the bottom.”";durling
1;23;139-141;"My leader stood a little with head bent down; Then he said: “Ill did he recount the business, who Hooks the sinners on this side.”";durling
1;23;142-144;And the friar: “In Bologna I once heard many Vices of the devil told, among which I heard that he Is a liar and the father of lies.”;durling
1;23;145-147;"Then my leader walked off with great strides, his Face a little disturbed with anger; so I left the Burdened ones,";durling
1;23;148-148;Following the prints of his dear feet.;durling
1;24;1-3;In that part of the youthful year when the sun tempers its locks under Aquarius and already the nights are moving south,;durling
1;24;4-6;when on the ground the frost copies the image of her white sister, but her pen retains its temper only briefly,;durling
1;24;7-9;"the peasant, his provisions running short, rises to look, and sees the fields all white; and he strikes his thigh,";durling
1;24;10-12;"goes back in his house, and complains here and there, like a wretch who knows not what to do; then he goes forth again and stores hope in his wicker basket,";durling
1;24;13-15;"again, seeing the face of the world has changed in a short time; and he takes his crook and drives the, little sheep forth to pasture:";durling
1;24;16-18;"O my master made me lose confidence, when saw his brow so clouded, and just as quickly he, applied the plaster to the wound;";durling
1;24;19-21; for, when we came to the ruined bridge, my leader turned to me with the sweet expression I first, saw at the foot of the mountain.;durling
1;24;22-24; After first having taken counsel with himself by examining the ruin carefully, he opened his arms, and took hold of me.;durling
1;24;25-27; And like one who uses judgment as he acts, always seeming to look ahead, so, carrying me up to,;durling
1;24;28-30;the top of one rock, he would look to another great splinter, saying: “Pull yourself up to that one next, but first test whether it will hold your weight.”;durling
1;24;31-33; It was not a path for anyone wearing a cloak, since only with difficulty, though he was light and, was pushed from below, were we able to climb from outcrop to outcrop.;durling
1;24;34-36;" And were it not that there the wall was shorter, than on the other side, I do not know about him, but I would have been quite overcome;";durling
1;24;37-39; but because all Malebolge slopes toward the, opening of the lowest pit, the nature of each valley requires;durling
1;24;40-42; that one wall be steep, the other low. Finally we, reached the point where the last rock had broken off.;durling
1;24;43-45; My breath was so milked from my lungs when I arrived there that I could go no further, but rather, sat down as soon as we arrived.;durling
1;24;46-48;" “From now on you will have to cast off sloth in this way,” said my master, “for one does not gain, fame sitting on down cushions, or while under coverlets;";durling
1;24;49-51; and whoever consumes his life without fame leaves a mark of himself on earth like smoke in the air or, foam in water.;durling
1;24;52-54;" And therefore stand up; conquer your panting with the spirit that conquers in every battle, if it does, not let the heavy body crush it down.";durling
1;24;55-57;" A longer ladder must we climb; it is not enough to have left those others behind. If you understand,me, now act so that it may help you.” ";durling
1;24;58-60;I stood up then, pretending to be better furnished with breath than I felt, and said: “Go, for I am strong, and bold.”;durling
1;24;61-63; Up along the ridge we took our way, which was jagged, narrow, and difficult, and much steeper than the last.;durling
1;24;64-66;"I was speaking as I went, so as not to seem feeble; and then a voice came from the next ditch, unapt to form words.";durling
1;24;67-69;I do not know what it said, although I was, already mounting the arch that crosses there, but the speaker seemed to be moved to anger.;durling
1;24;70-72;"I was looking downward, but my sharp eyes could not attain the bottom, because of the dark; and I: “Master, when you reach,";durling
1;24;73-75;"the next belt, let us descend from the ridge; for as from here I hear but cannot understand, so I look down but make nothing out.”";durling
1;24;76-78;"“No other reply,” he said, “do I give than action; for a virtuous request should be obeyed without discussion.”";durling
1;24;79-81;"We came down from the bridgehead where it joins the eighth bank, and then the pouch was made manifest to me;";durling
1;24;82-84;and I saw within it a terrible crowding of serpents, and of such a strange kind that the memory still curdles my blood.;durling
1;24;85-87;"Let Libya brag of its sands no more; for if it produces chelydri, jaculi, and phareae, and chenchres with amphisbaenae,";durling
1;24;88-90;never did it show so many pestilences nor so poisonous, together with all Ethiopia and what lies beyond the Red Sea.;durling
1;24;91-93;Amid this harsh and savage plenty were running naked, terrified people, without hope of a crevice or a heliotrope:;durling
1;24;94-96;"their hands were bound behind them with snakes; these thrust through the loins their tails and heads and were knotted in front.";durling
1;24;97-99;And behold, a serpent hurled itself at one near our bank and transfixed him where the neck is knotted to the shoulders.;durling
1;24;100-102;"Neither O nor I has ever been written so fast as he caught fire and burned and was all consumed, falling, to ashes;";durling
1;24;103-105;and when he was on the ground, destroyed, the dust gathered together by itself and instantly became the same one again.;durling
1;24;106-108;"Thus the great sages profess that the Phoenix dies and is reborn, when it approaches its five hundredth year;";durling
1;24;109-111;in its life it eats neither grass nor grain but only tears of incense and of balsam, and nard and myrrh are its winding sheet.;durling
1;24;112-114;And like one who falls, he knows not how, by the force of a demon that pulls him to the earth or of some other occlusion that can bind a man,;durling
1;24;115-117;when he stands up he gazes about all dismayed by the great anguish he has suffered, and sighs as he looks:;durling
1;24;118-120;such was the sinner when he stood up. Oh the power of God, how severe it is, what torrents of punishment it pours forth!;durling
1;24;121-123;"My leader then asked him who he was; and he replied: “I rained down from Tuscany, not long ago, into this fierce throat.";durling
1;24;124-126;"Bestial life pleased me, not human, mule that I was; I am Vanni Fucci the beast, and Pistoia was a worthy lair for me.";durling
1;24;127-129;"And I to my leader: “Tell him not to sneak off, and ask him what sin drove him down here; for I saw him a bloody, wrathful man.";durling
1;24;130-132;"And the sinner, who heard, did not feign, but turned to me his mind and his face and was covered with sad shame;";durling
1;24;133-135;then he said: “It pains me more to be caught in the wretchedness where you see me than when I was taken from the other life.;durling
1;24;136-138;I cannot refuse what you ask: I am placed so far down because I stole the beautiful appointments from the sacristy,;durling
1;24;139-141;and it was falsely blamed on others. But lest you joy in seeing me, if you ever get out of these dark places,;durling
1;24;142-144;"open your ears to my message, and listen. Pistoia first thins itself of Blacks; then Florence makes new its laws and people.";durling

1;24;151-151;And I have told you this that it may grieve you!”;durling
1;25;1-3;At the end of his words the thief raised his hands with both the figs, crying: “Take them, God, I’m aiming at you!”;durling
1;25;4-6;From then on snakes have been my friends, because one of them wrapped itself around his neck, as if to say “I won’t let him say more,”;durling
1;25;7-9;and another around his arms, and bound them up, tying itself so tight in front that he could not budge.;durling
1;25;10-12;Ah, Pistoia, Pistoia, why do you not decree your incineration, so that you may not endure, since you surpass your sowers in doing ill?;durling
1;25;13-15;Through all the dark circles of Hell I saw no spirit so proud against God, not him who fell from the wall at Thebes.;durling
1;25;16-18;"He fled without saying another word; and I saw a centaur, full of rage, come crying: “Where is he, where is he, the unripe one?”";durling
1;25;19-21;I do not think Maremma has as many water snakes as he had on his back from the rump to where our shape begins.;durling
1;25;22-24;"On his shoulders, behind his nape, lay a dragon spreading its wings; it sets fire to any they meet.";durling
1;25;25-27;My master said: “That is Cacus, who beneath the rocks of Mount Aventine many times made a lake of blood.;durling
1;25;28-30;"He does not follow the same path as his brothers, because he fraudulently stole the great herd he found close by;";durling
1;25;31-33;therefore his cross-eyed deeds ended under Hercules’ club, which perhaps gave him a hundred, but he did not feel ten of them.”;durling
1;25;34-36;As he was speaking, the centaur went by and three spirits came below us, whom neither I nor my leader perceived;durling
1;25;37-39;until they cried: “Who are you?” For this reason our talk ceased, and they alone claimed our attention.;durling
1;25;40-42;"I did not know them; but it happened, as it often does by some chance, that one of them had to name another,";durling
1;25;43-45;saying: “Where has Cianfa stayed?” Therefore I, so that my leader should pay attention, stretched my finger from chin to nose.;durling
1;25;46-48;If now, reader, you are slow to believe what I say, that will be no marvel, for I, who saw it, hardly allow it.;durling
1;25;49-51;As I was raising my brows toward them, a serpent with six feet threw itself on one of them and embraced him closely.;durling
1;25;52-54;"Its middle feet it wrapped around his waist, with its forefeet it seized his arms; then it pierced both his cheeks with its fangs;";durling
1;25;55-57;its hind feet it spread along his thighs, and put its tail between them, extending it up along his loins:;durling
1;25;58-60;ivy never took root on a tree so tightly as the horrible beast grew vinelike around the other’s limbs.;durling
1;25;61-63;After they had adhered to each other like hot wax and had mixed their colors, neither seemed what it had been:;durling
1;25;64-66;"as, when paper burns, a dark color moves up it preceding the flame; it is not yet black, but the white is dying.";durling
1;25;67-69;The other two were staring at him, and each cried: “Oh me, Agnel, how you are changing! See, already you are neither two nor one.”;durling
1;25;70-72;Already the two heads had become one, so that two sets of features seemed mingled in one face, where two heads were lost.;durling
1;25;73-75;"The arms became two strips from four; the thighs and the legs and the belly and the chest became members never before seen.";durling
1;25;76-78;"Every former appearance there was shattered; two and none the perverse image seemed, and off it moved with slow steps.";durling
1;25;79-81;As the lizard, changing hedges under the great scourge of the dog days, seems lightning as it crosses the road:;durling
1;25;82-84;"so seemed an inflamed little serpent, livid and black like a grain of pepper, coming toward the bellies of the other two;";durling
1;25;85-87;"and one of them it pierced in the place where our first nourishment is taken; then it fell stretched out before him.";durling
1;25;88-90;"The one transfixed gazed at it but said nothing; rather, standing still, he yawned as if sleep or fever assailed him.";durling
1;25;91-93;"He was gazing at the serpent, and the serpent at him; one through his wound and the other through its mouth was sending forth smoke, and the smoke met.";durling

1;25;100-102;for never two natures face to face did he transmute so that both forms were ready to exchange their matter.;durling
1;25;103-105;They answered each other according to this rule: that the serpent split its tail in two, and the wounded one drew his soles together.;durling
1;25;106-108;His legs and thighs so adhered that soon the joining left no mark that could be seen.;durling
1;25;109-111;The cleft tail took the shape the other was losing, and its skin softened, but over there it hardened.;durling
1;25;112-114;I saw both his arms withdraw into the armpits, and the beast’s two feet, which were short, lengthen as much as the other’s were shortening.;durling
1;25;115-117;Then the hind feet, twisted together, became the member which a man hides, and the other wretch out of his had extended two feet.;durling
1;25;118-120;While the smoke veils both of them with a new color, generating hair on one side, and peeling it off on the other,;durling
1;25;121-123;one stood up and the other fell down, but they did not turn aside their pitiless lanterns, under whose gaze each was changing his snout.;durling
1;25;124-126;"He who was erect drew his in toward the temples, and of the excess matter made ears that came out over narrow cheeks;";durling
1;25;127-129;what of that excess did not go to the rear became a nose for the face and filled out the cheeks as much as was fitting.;durling
1;25;130-132;"He who was lying down, extends his snout forward and withdraws his ears into his head as the snail does its horns;";durling
1;25;133-135;"and his tongue, which had previously been whole and ready to speak, is split, and the other’s forked one is joined; and the smoke stops.";durling
1;25;136-138;The soul who had become a beast fled hissing through the valley, and the other spits as he speaks after him.;durling
1;25;139-141;Then he turned his new back on him and said to the other: “I want Buoso to run, as I have, on all sixes along this path.”;durling
1;25;142-144;"Thus I saw the seventh cargo change and change again; and here let the novelty excuse me if my pen ever falters.";durling

1;26;13-15;"We left, and up along the steps made for us earlier by the projecting bourns, my leader mounted, drawing me after him;";durling
1;26;16-18;and as we pursued our solitary way among the splinters and rocks of the ridge, our feet could not proceed without our hands.;durling
1;26;19-21;Then I grieved, and now I grieve again, when I consider what I saw, and I rein in my wit more than is my custom,;durling
1;26;22-24;that it may not run without virtue guiding it, so that, if a good star or something better has given me what is good, I may not deprive myself of it.;durling
1;26;25-27;As many fireflies as the peasant—resting on the hillside in the season when he who lights the world least hides from us his face,;durling
1;26;28-30;when the fly gives way to the mosquito—sees down along the valley, perhaps where he harvests and plows:;durling
1;26;31-33;with so many flames the eighth pocket was all shining, as I perceived when I was where I could see its depths.;durling
1;26;34-36;And as he who avenged himself with the bears saw Elijah’s chariot departing, when the horses rose so steeply to Heaven;durling
1;26;37-39;that he could not follow them with his eyes so as to see more than the flame alone, like a little cloud, rising up:;durling
1;26;40-42;so each moves along the throat of the ditch, for none displays its theft, and every flame steals away a sinner.;durling
1;26;43-45;I was standing erect on the bridge in order to see, so that if I had not grasped a projection, I would have fallen without being pushed.;durling
1;26;46-48;"And my leader, who saw me so intent, said: “Within the fires are the spirits; each is swathed in that which burns him inwardly.”";durling

1;26;55-57;"He answered me: “There within are punished Ulysses and Diomedes; thus together they go to punishment as they went to anger.";durling

1;26;73-75;"Let me speak, for I have conceived what you wish; for perhaps they would shun, because they were Greeks, your words.”";durling
1;26;76-78;When the flame had come to where my leader thought it the time and place, in this form I heard him speak:;durling
1;26;79-81;“O you who are two within one fire, if I deserved from you while I lived, if I deserved from you greatly or little;durling
1;26;82-84;"when in the world I wrote my high verses, do not move away; but let one of you tell where, lost, he went to die.”";durling
1;26;85-87;"The greater horn of the ancient flame began to shake, murmuring, like one a wind belabors;";durling
1;26;88-90;then, moving its peak here and there, as if it were a tongue that spoke, it cast out a voice and said:;durling

1;26;106-108;I and my companions were old and slow when we came to that narrow strait which Hercules marked with his warnings;durling

1;26;139-141;Three times it made the ship to turn about with all the waters, at the fourth to raise its stern aloft and the prow to go down, as it pleased another,;durling
1;26;142-142;until the sea had closed over us.”;durling
1;27;1-3;Already the flame was erect and quiet, no longer speaking, and already it had left us with the permission of my sweet poet,;durling
1;27;4-6;when another, coming after it, made us turn our eyes to its peak because of a confused sound coming out from it.;durling
1;27;7-9;As the Sicilian bull, which first bellowed with the cries of him—and that was right—who had tempered it with his file,;durling
1;27;10-12;used to bellow with the voice of the afflicted one, so that, though made of brass, still it seemed transfixed with pain:;durling
1;27;13-15;so, not having any path or outlet from its origin within the fire, the anguished words were converted into its language.;durling
1;27;16-18;But after they had found their way up to the tip, imparting to it that wriggling which the tongue had given them in their passage,;durling
1;27;19-21;we heard it say: “O you to whom I direct my voice and who were just now speaking Lombard, saying: ‘Istra you may go, I incite you no further,’;durling

1;27;55-57;Now who you are I beg you to tell us: do not be harder than others have been to you, so may your name hold up its brow in the world.”;durling
1;27;58-60;After the flame had roared a bit in its manner, it moved its sharp tongue here and there, and then gave forth this breath:;durling
1;27;61-63;"“If I believed that my reply were to a person who would ever return to the world, this flame would remain without further shaking;";durling
1;27;64-66;but since never from this depth has any one returned alive, if I hear the truth, without fear of infamy I answer you.;durling
1;27;67-69;"I was a man of arms, and then I was a Franciscan, believing, so girt, to make amends; and surely my belief would have been fulfilled,";durling
1;27;70-72;"had it not been for the high priest, may evil take him! who put me back into my first sins; and how and why, I wish you to hear from me.";durling
1;27;73-75;While I was the form of bone and flesh that my mother gave me, my works were not those of a lion but a fox.;durling
1;27;76-78;The tricks and the hidden ways, I knew them all, and I so plied their art that the fame of it went out to the ends of the earth.;durling
1;27;79-81;When I saw I had reached that part of my life where every man should lower the sails and coil the ropes,;durling
1;27;82-84;"what earlier pleased me, then grieved me, and I gave myself up repentant and shriven; ah, miserable wretch that I am! and it would have worked.";durling
1;27;85-87;The prince of the new Pharisees, making war near the Lateran, and not against Saracens or Jews,;durling
1;27;88-90;for each of his enemies was a Christian, and none had been to take Acre nor a merchant in the Sultan’s lands—,;durling
1;27;91-93;regarded neither his highest office nor holy orders in himself, nor in me the rope that used to make its wearers thinner.;durling
1;27;94-96;"But, as Constantine asked Sylvester in Soracte to cure him of leprosy, so he asked me to teach him to recover from his proud fever;";durling
1;27;97-99;he asked my advice, and I was silent, for his words seemed drunken.;durling
1;27;100-102;Then he said again: ‘Let not your heart fear: henceforth I absolve you, if you teach me how to raze Palestrina to the ground.;durling
1;27;103-105;"Heaven I can lock and unlock, as you know; for that reason the keys are two which my predecessor did not prize.’";durling
1;27;106-108;Then his weighty arguments impelled me, for silence seemed to me the worse course, and I said:;durling
1;27;109-111;‘Father, since you wash me of that sin into which I now must fall, a long promise with a short keeping will make you triumph on your high throne.’;durling
1;27;112-114;"Francis came later, when I had died, for me; but one of the black cherubim told him: ‘Do not take him, do not wrong me.";durling
1;27;115-117;"He must come down among my slaves, because he gave the fraudulent counsel, since when, until now, I have been at his locks;";durling
1;27;118-120;for he cannot be absolved who does not repent, nor can one repent and will together, because of the contradiction, which does not permit it.’;durling
1;27;121-123;Oh wretched me! how I trembled when he seized me, telling me: ‘Perhaps you did not think I was a logician!’;durling
1;27;124-126;"He carried me to Minos; and that one twisted his tail eight times about his hard back, and after he had bitten it in his great rage,";durling
1;27;127-129;"he said: “This is one who deserves the thieving fire’; so that I am lost here where you see me, and thus clothed I go tormenting myself.”";durling
1;27;130-132;When it had finished speaking thus, the grieving flame departed, twisting and beating about with its sharp horn.;durling
1;27;133-135;We passed further, both I and my leader, up along the ridge as far as the next arch, which covers the ditch where the toll is collected ;durling
1;27;136-136;from those who gain cargo by putting apart.;durling
1;28;1-3;Who could ever, even with unbound words, tell in full of the blood and wounds that I now saw, though he should narrate them many times?;durling
1;28;4-6;Every tongue would surely fail, because our language and our memory have little capacity to comprehend so much.;durling
1;28;7-9;If one gathered together all the people who ever, on the travailed earth of Apulia, groaning poured forth their blood;durling
1;28;10-12;on account of the Trojans, and in the long war that took such heaped spoils of rings, as Livy writes, who does not err,;durling
1;28;13-15;and the people who suffered wounds when resisting Robert Guiscard, and the others whose bones are still being collected;durling
1;28;16-18;at Ceperano, where every Apulian was a liar, and at Tagliacozzo, where old Alard won without arms,;durling
1;28;19-21;and this one showed his perforated, this one his truncated member, it would be nothing to equal the wretched mode of the ninth pocket.;durling
1;28;22-24;Surely a barrel, losing centerpiece or half-moon, is not so broken as one I saw torn open from the chin to the farting-place.;durling
1;28;25-27;"Between his legs dangled his intestines; the pluck was visible, and the wretched bag that makes shit of what is swallowed.";durling
1;28;28-30;While I was all absorbed in the sight of him, he, gazing back at me, with his hands opened up his breast, saying: “Now see how I spread myself!;durling
1;28;31-33;See how Mohammed is torn open! Ahead of me Ali goes weeping, his face cloven from chin to forelock.;durling
1;28;34-36;And all the others you see here were sowers of scandal and schism while they were alive, and therefore are they cloven in this way.;durling
1;28;37-39;There is a devil back there who carves us so cruelly, putting the edge of his sword to each in this ream;durling
1;28;40-42;once we have circled through the suffering road, for the wounds have closed before any confronts him again.;durling
1;28;43-45;But who are you sniffing at us from up on the ridge, perhaps to delay going to the punishment decreed on your crimes?”;durling
1;28;46-48;"“Death has not reached him yet, nor does guilt lead him,” replied my master, “into torment; but so that he may have full experience,";durling
1;28;49-51;"I, who am dead, must lead him through Hell down here from circle to circle; and this is as true as that I am speaking to you.”";durling
1;28;52-54;More than a hundred were they who, hearing him, stopped in the ditch to gaze up at me in amazement, forgetting their suffering.;durling
1;28;55-57;“Now then, you who will perhaps shortly see the sun, tell Brother Dolcino, if he does not want to follow me soon down here,;durling

1;28;61-63;"Holding one foot lifted to walk away, Mohammed spoke this word to me; then, departing, he set it down.";durling
1;28;64-66;Another, whose throat was bored through, his nose cut up to his eyebrows, and with only one ear,;durling
1;28;67-69;stopping to gaze up at me in amazement with the others, first of the others opened his windpipe, which was all covered with crimson,;durling
1;28;70-72;and said: “O you whom guilt does not condemn, and whom I saw in Italy, if too close a resemblance does not deceive me,;durling
1;28;73-75;remember Pier of Medicina, if you ever return to see the lovely plain sloping down from Vercelli to Marcabo.;durling
1;28;76-78;And tell the two best men of Fano, messer Guido and Angiolello, that, if foresight is not empty here,;durling
1;28;79-81;they will be thrown from their vessel in a weighted sack and drowned near Cattolica, thanks to the treachery of a wicked tyrant.;durling
1;28;82-84;Between the islands of Cyprus and Maiolica Neptune has never seen so great a sin done, not by pirates, not by Argolians.;durling
1;28;85-87;That traitor who sees with only one eye, who holds the city that my fellow wishes he had still to see,;durling
1;28;88-90;"will have them come to parley; he will bring it about that they need no vows or prayers against the Focara wind.”";durling
1;28;91-93;And I to him: “Show me and explain, if you wish me to carry news back up about you, who is the one of the bitter sight?”;durling
1;28;94-96;Then he put his hand to the jaw of one of his companions and opened his mouth for him, crying: “This is he, and he cannot speak.;durling
1;28;97-99;He, an exile, drowned Caesar’s doubts, affirming that one prepared always suffers from delay.”;durling
1;28;100-102;Oh how dismayed Curio seemed, with the tongue cut out of his throat, he who was so bold to speak!;durling
1;28;103-105;And one who had both hands cut off, lifting the stumps in the murky air so that the blood soiled his face,;durling
1;28;106-108;cried: “You will remember Mosca, too, who said, alas, ‘A thing done is done,’ the seed of evil for the Tuscans.”;durling
1;28;109-111;"And I added: “And the death of your clan”; so that he, piling grief on grief, walked off like a person mad with sorrow.";durling
1;28;112-114;But I remained to gaze at the host, and I saw something that I would fear, without more proof, even to retell,;durling
1;28;115-117;except that my conscience makes me confident, the good companion that frees a man, if it wears the hauberk of knowing itself pure.;durling
1;28;118-120;"I surely saw, and it seems I still see, a torso without a head walking like the others of the sorry flock;";durling
1;28;121-123;"and his severed head he was holding up by the hair, dangling it from his hand like a lantern; and the head was gazing at us, saying: “Oh me!”";durling
1;28;124-126;"Of himself he made a lamp for himself, and they were two in one and one in two; how that can be, he knows who so disposes.";durling
1;28;127-129;When he was directly at the foot of the bridge, he raised his arm far up, head and all, to bring his words close to us,;durling
1;28;130-132;which were: “Now see my wretched punishment, you who go still breathing to view the dead: see if any is great as this.;durling
1;28;133-135;And that you may take back news of me, know that I am Bertran de Born, he who gave the young king the bad encouragements.;durling
1;28;136-138;I made father and son revolt against each other: Achitophel did no worse to Absalom and David with his evil proddings.;durling
1;28;139-141;Because I divided persons so joined, I carry my brain divided, alas, from its origin which is in this trunk.;durling
1;28;142-142;Thus you observe in me the counter-suffering.”;durling
1;29;1-3;The multitude of people and their strange wounds had so inebriated my eyes that they longed to stay and weep.;durling
1;29;4-6;But Virgil said to me: “Why do you still stare? Why does your sight still dwell on those wretched mutilated shades down there?;durling
1;29;7-9;"You did not act thus at the other pockets; think, if you believe you could number them, that the valley turns for twenty-two miles.";durling
1;29;10-12;"And already the moon is beneath our feet; little remains of the time granted us, and there are other things to see that you do not see.”";durling
1;29;13-15;“If you had attended,” I then answered him, “to the cause for which I was staring, perhaps you would have permitted me to stay longer.”;durling
1;29;16-18;Meanwhile my leader walked on, with me behind him already replying, and adding: “Within that hollow;durling
1;29;19-21;where just now I was fixing my eyes, I think a spirit of my blood is weeping for the guilt that costs so much down there.”;durling
1;29;22-24;"Then said my master: “Let not your thought break over him from now on. Attend to other things, and let him stay there;";durling
1;29;25-27;for I saw him at the foot of the bridge, pointing at you and threatening fiercely with his finger, and I heard him called Geri del Bello.;durling
1;29;28-30;You were then so caught by him who held Hautefort that you did not look there, and he went off.”;durling
1;29;31-33;“O my leader, his violent death, as yet unavenged,” I said, “by anyone who shares the shame of it,;durling
1;29;34-36;"has made him full of scorn; therefore he walked away without speaking to me, as I judge, and that has made me more compassionate toward him.”";durling
1;29;37-39;Thus we talked as far as the first place on the ridge to show the next valley, if there were more light there, down to its bed.;durling
1;29;40-42;When we were above the last cloister of Malebolge, so that its converts could appear to our sight,;durling
1;29;43-45;strange lamentings struck me, arrows whose iron heads were made of pity, so that I covered my ears with my hands.;durling
1;29;46-48;What the suffering would be, if the sick from the hospitals of Valdichiana between July and September, and from Maremma and Sardinia,;durling
1;29;49-51;were all in one ditch together: such was it there, and a stench came from it like that from rotting limbs.;durling
1;29;52-54;"We climbed down to the last bank from the long ridge, still to the left; and then my sight was livelier";durling
1;29;55-57;down toward the bottom, where the minister of the Lord, infallible justice, punishes the falsifiers that it registers here.;durling
1;29;58-60;I do not believe it was a greater sadness to see in Aegina the whole people sick, when the air was so full of malice;durling
1;29;61-63;that the animals, down to the little worm, all fell— and then the ancient people, according to what the poets firmly believe,;durling
1;29;64-66;were restored from the seed of ants—than it was to see, along that dark valley, the spirits languishing in different heaps.;durling
1;29;67-69;This one lay over another’s stomach, that one over another’s shoulders, and this one crawling transmuted himself down the evil road.;durling
1;29;70-72;Step by step we walked without speech, seeing and hearing the sick, who could not lift their bodies.;durling
1;29;73-75;"I saw two sitting propped against each other, as one props pan against pan to cool, both from head to foot all spotted with scabs;";durling
1;29;76-78;and I have never seen a currycomb so plied by a boy awaited by his master, or by one who unwilling stayed awake,;durling
1;29;79-81;"as each one of them plied the bite of his fingernails on himself, for the great rage of the itch, which no longer has any remedy;";durling
1;29;82-84;their nails tore off the scabs like knives scaling bream or some other fish with larger scales.;durling
1;29;85-87;“O you who dismail yourself with your fingers,” began my leader to one of them, “and at times make pincers of them,;durling
1;29;88-90;tell us if any Italian is among those in here, so may your nail suffice eternally for this work.”;durling
1;29;91-93;"“We are Italians, whom you see so ruined here, both of us,” one replied weeping; “but who are you who have asked about us?”";durling
1;29;94-96;And my leader said: “I am one descending with this living man from ledge to ledge, and I intend to show him Hell.”;durling
1;29;97-99;Then the mutual support was broken, and trembling each of them turned to me, along with others who heard the words as if by echo.;durling
1;29;100-102;"My good master drew near to me, saying: “Say to them what you wish”; and I began, since he wished it:";durling
1;29;103-105;“So may your memory not be stolen from human minds in the first world, so may it live for many suns,;durling
1;29;106-108;"tell me who you are and of what people; let not your filthy and disgusting punishment make you fear to reveal yourselves to me.”";durling
1;29;109-111;"“I was from Arezzo, and Albero of Siena,” replied one, “sent me to the fire; but what I died for is not what leads me here.";durling
1;29;112-114;"It is true that I told him, joking: ‘I could raise myself through the air in flight’; and he, who had eagerness but little sense,";durling
1;29;115-117;"wanted me to show him the art; and only because I did not make him Daedalus, he had me burned by one who loved him as a son.";durling
1;29;118-120;But to the last pocket of the ten, for alchemy, which I practiced in the world, Minos damned me, who may not err.”;durling
1;29;121-123;And I said to my poet: “Now was there ever a people so foolish as the Sienese? Certainly not the French, by far!”;durling
1;29;124-126;And the other leper, who heard me, replied to my word: “Except for Stricca, he knew how to spend moderately,;durling
1;29;127-129;and Nicholas, who first discovered the rich custom of cloves, in the garden where that seed takes root,;durling
1;29;130-132;and except for the crew for whom Caccia d’Asciano used up his vineyard and his great farmlands, and to whom Bedazzled displayed his wisdom.;durling
1;29;133-135;But so that you may know who seconds you against the Sienese, sharpen your eye toward me, that my face may answer to you:;durling
1;29;136-138;"then you will see that I am the shade of Capocchio, who falsified metals with alchemy; and you must remember, if I eye you well,";durling
1;29;139-139;how good an ape I was of nature.”;durling
1;30;1-3;In the time when, because of Semele, Juno was angry against the blood of Thebes, as she showed once and again,;durling
1;30;4-6;Athamas became so insane, that, seeing his wife walking with his two sons on either hand,;durling
1;30;7-9;he cried: “Spread the nets, so that I may catch the lioness and her cubs at the crossing!” And then he stretched out his pitiless claws,;durling
1;30;10-12;"taking the one whose name was Learchus, and whirled him and struck his head against a rock; and she drowned herself with her other burden.";durling
1;30;13-15;And when Fortune leveled to the ground the pride of the Trojans, all aflame, so that along with his kingdom the king was broken,;durling
1;30;16-18;Hecuba, sorrowing, wretched, and a captive, after she saw Polyxena dead, and, grieving, had perceived her Polydorus on the shore;durling
1;30;19-21;of the sea, going mad, she barked like a dog, her grief had so twisted her mind.;durling
1;30;22-24;But neither Theban furies nor Trojan ever made anyone so cruel, not to wound beasts, let alone human limbs,;durling
1;30;25-27;as two pallid, naked shades I saw, who ran biting in the manner of the pig when the sty is opened.;durling
1;30;28-30;One reached Capocchio and set his tusk into the knot of his neck so that, dragging, he made him scratch his belly on the solid floor.;durling
1;30;31-33;And the Aretine, who remained, trembling told me: “That goblin is Gianni Schicchi, and in his rage he goes treating others so.”;durling
1;30;34-36;“Oh,” I said to him, “so may the other not set his teeth in you, let it not be a labor to tell me who he is, before he disappears.”;durling
1;30;37-39;And he to me: “That is the ancient soul of wicked Myrrha, who became, beyond right love, her father’s lover.;durling
1;30;40-42;She came to sin with him by counterfeiting herself in another’s shape, just as the other who goes off there,;durling
1;30;43-45;to gain the queen of the herd dared to counterfeit in himself Buoso Donati, making a will and giving it legal form.”;durling
1;30;46-48;And when the two rabid shades, on whom I had kept my eyes, had passed, I turned to gaze at the other ill-born ones.;durling
1;30;49-51;I saw one made in the shape of a lute, if he had had his groin cut from the other forked part.;durling
1;30;52-54;The heavy dropsy that so unpairs the members, with the liquid that it ill converts, that the face does not answer to the belly,;durling
1;30;55-57;made him hold his lips open, as a fevered person does, who in his thirst turns one of them down toward his chin and the other upward.;durling
1;30;58-60;“O you who are without any punishment, and I know not why, in this grim world,” he said to us, “gaze and attend;durling

1;30;64-66;The little streams that from the green hills of the Casentino come down into Arno, making their channels cool and moist,;durling
1;30;67-69;always stand before me, and not in vain, for their image dries me far more than the disease that robs my face of flesh.;durling
1;30;70-72;The rigid justice that probes me takes occasion from the place where I sinned, to put my sighs the more to flight.;durling
1;30;73-75;There is Romena, where I falsified the alloy sealed with the Baptist, for which I left my body burned up there.;durling
1;30;76-78;But if I might see here the wicked soul of Guido or Alessandro or their brother, for Fonte Branda I would not trade the sight.;durling
1;30;79-81;"One of them has already come, if the raging shades who run about here tell the truth; but what does it help me, since my members are bound?";durling
1;30;82-84;If I were just so light that in a hundred years I could go one inch, I would have already set out on the path,;durling
1;30;85-87;searching through all this filthy people, although it turns for eleven miles and is no less than half a mile across.;durling
1;30;88-90;Because of them I am among such a household: they induced me to mint the florins that had three carats of dross.”;durling
1;30;91-93;And I to him: “Who are the two wretches smoking like wet hands in winter, lying close on your right-hand boundary?”;durling
1;30;94-96;“Here I found them—and since then they have not even turned over,” he replied, “when I rained down into this pit, and I do not believe they will for eternity.;durling
1;30;97-99;"One is the false woman who accused Joseph; the other is false Greek, Sinon of Troy: because of acute fever they throw out such a stench.”";durling
1;30;100-102;And one of them, who perhaps resented being named so darkly, with his fist struck him on his taut belly.;durling
1;30;103-105;"That resounded as if it were a drum; and Master Adam struck the other’s face with his arm, which seemed no less hard,";durling

1;30;109-111;"And he replied: “When you were going to the fire, you didn’t have it so ready; but that much and more you had it when you were coining.”";durling
1;30;112-114;And the hydroptic: “You say true there, but you were not such a true witness where you were asked for the truth at Troy.”;durling
1;30;115-117;“If I spoke falsely, you falsified the coinage,” said Sinon, “and I am here for one fault, but you for more than any other demon!”;durling
1;30;118-120;"“Remember, perjurer, the Horse,” replied he of the swollen liver; “and let it be bitter to you that the whole world knows of it!”";durling
1;30;121-123;“And to you bitter be the thirst that cracks,” said the Greek, “your tongue, and the stagnant water that makes of your belly a hedge before your eyes!”;durling
1;30;124-126;"Then the coiner: “Your mouth gapes because of your disease, as usual; for, if I am thirsty and liquid swells me,";durling
1;30;127-129;you have burning fever and a head that aches, and to lick the mirror of Narcissus you would not need to be invited with many words!”;durling
1;30;130-132;I was all intent to listen to them, when my master said to me: “Now keep looking, for I am not far from quarreling with you!”;durling
1;30;133-135;When I heard him speak to me angrily, I turned toward him with such shame that it still dizzies me in memory.;durling
1;30;136-138;Like one who dreams of harm, and, dreaming, wishes he were dreaming, so that he yearns for what is as if it were not,;durling
1;30;139-141;so I became, unable to speak, wishing to excuse myself, and I was excusing myself all along, though I did not think so.;durling
1;30;142-144;"“Less shame washes away a greater fault,” said my master, “than yours has been; therefore cast off all sorrow.";durling
1;30;145-147;And mind that I be always at your side, if it happen again that Fortune find you where people are in such a squabble:;durling
1;30;148-148;for to wish to hear that is a base desire.”;durling
1;31;1-3;One and the same tongue first stung me so that both my cheeks were stained, and then held out the medicine to me:;durling
1;31;4-6;so I hear that the spear of Achilles and his father was the cause first of ill and then of good reward.;durling
1;31;7-9;We turned our backs on the wretched valley, up along the bank that girds it round, crossing over without further speech.;durling
1;31;10-12;"Here it was less than night and less than day, so that my sight did not pierce far ahead; but I heard the sound of a horn so loud";durling
1;31;13-15;that it would make any thunder feeble, which drew my eyes straight to one place, following its path backward.;durling
1;31;16-18;After the dolorous rout, when Charlemagne lost the holy company, Roland did not sound his horn so terribly.;durling
1;31;19-21;"I had not long held my head turned there, when I seemed to see many high towers; therefore I: “Master, say, what city is this?”";durling
1;31;22-24;And he to me: “Because your sight traverses the shadows from too far away, your imagining is blurred.;durling
1;31;25-27;"You will see clearly, when you reach it, how sense is deceived by distance; therefore drive yourself a little further.”";durling
1;31;28-30;Then he took me affectionately by the hand and said: “Before we are any closer, so that the fact may seem less frightening to you,;durling
1;31;31-33;know that they are not towers, but giants, and they are in the pit, around its rim, from the navel downward, all of them.”;durling
1;31;34-36;As, when mist dissolves, the gaze little by little makes out the shape of what the vapor-thickened air had hidden,;durling
1;31;37-39;"so, boring through the thick dark atmosphere, drawing closer and closer to the edge, my error fled and my fear grew;";durling
1;31;40-42;for, as above its circling walls Montereggione is crowned by towers, so there above the bank that circles the pit;durling
1;31;43-45;towered with half their persons the horrible giants, whom Jove still threatens from the sky when he thunders.;durling
1;31;46-48;And I already discerned the face of one, his shoulders and breast, and a large part of his belly, and down his sides both his arms.;durling
1;31;49-51;Nature surely, when she left off the crafting of animals like those, did well to deprive Mars of such instruments.;durling
1;31;52-54;"And if she has not repented of elephants and whales, whoever considers subtly will hold her more just and more discreet;";durling
1;31;55-57;for where sharpness of mind is joined to evil will and power, there is no defense people can make against them.;durling
1;31;58-60;"His face seemed as long and broad as the pine cone of Saint Peter in Rome, and to that proportion were his other bones;";durling
1;31;61-63;so that the bank, which was his apron from the waist down, left so much of him exposed above it that to reach his mane;durling
1;31;64-66;three Frisians would have boasted idly, for I saw thirty great spans down from the place where the mantle is clasped.;durling
1;31;67-69;“Raphel mai amécche zabi almi,” the fierce mouth began to shout, for no gentler psalms befitted it.;durling
1;31;70-72;And my leader toward him: “Foolish soul, be content with your horn, give vent with that, when anger or some other passion touches you!;durling
1;31;73-75;Feel at your neck, and you will find the thong that holds it, o befuddled soul, and there it is, curving across your breast like a bow.”;durling
1;31;76-78;"Then he said to me: “Himself accuses himself; that is Nimrod, because of whose evil thought the world no longer speaks one language.";durling
1;31;79-81;Let us leave him alone and not waste speech, for to him every language is like his to others, unknown.”;durling
1;31;82-84;"Therefore we took a longer path, turning to the left; at the distance of a cross-bow shot we found the next, much fiercer and larger.";durling
1;31;85-87;Who was the master to bind him I cannot say, but one arm was held in front and the right arm behind him,;durling
1;31;88-90;by a chain wrapped about him from the neck down, so that on what we saw of him it made five full turns.;durling
1;31;91-93;“This proud one wished to prove his power against highest Jove,” said my leader, “‘and thus is he rewarded.;durling
1;31;94-96;"His name is Ephialtes, and he performed great deeds when the giants made the gods afraid; the arm he struck with then, he never moves.”";durling
1;31;97-99;And I to him: “If it can be, I would wish my eyes to have experience of the immense Briareus.”;durling
1;31;100-102;"And he replied: “You will see Antaeus near here, who speaks and is unbound; he will place us at the bottom of all wickedness.";durling
1;31;103-105;He whom you wish to see is much further over there, and he is bound and shaped like this one, except that his face seems fiercer.”;durling
1;31;106-108;Never could rough earthquake so violently shake a tower as Ephialtes suddenly shook himself.;durling
1;31;109-111;Then more than ever I feared death, and the fright alone would have sufficed, had I not seen his bonds.;durling
1;31;112-114;We walked further then, and we came to Antaeus, who rose a good five ells, not counting his head, out of the pit.;durling
1;31;115-117;“O you who once—in the fortunate valley that made Scipio the heir of glory when Hannibal and his men turned tail—;durling
1;31;118-120;brought in a thousand lions as your catch, and, if you had been present at your brothers’ great war, it seems some still believe;durling
1;31;121-123;the sons of earth would have been victorious: set us down, and do not disdain to do so, where the cold locks in Cocytus.;durling
1;31;124-126;"Do not make us go to Tityos or to Typhon: this man can give what here is desired; therefore bend down and do not twist your snout.";durling
1;31;127-129;He can still repay you with fame in the world, for he is alive and expects long life still, if grace does not call him before his time.”;durling
1;31;130-132;"So spoke my master; and he in haste stretched out his hands, whose powerful grip Hercules once felt, and grasped my leader.";durling
1;31;133-135;Virgil, when he felt himself gripped, said to me: “Come here, that I may hold you.” Then he made one bundle of himself and me.;durling
1;31;136-138;As Garisenda appears from below the leaning side when a cloud passes above it so that it seems to fall:;durling
1;31;139-141;so Antaeus appeared as I stood waiting to see him bend over, and that was a time when I would have wished to go by another road.;durling
1;31;142-144;"But lightly he set us down on the bottom that devours Lucifer with Judas; nor did he remain bent over, ";durling
1;31;145-145;but like the mast of a ship he raised himself.;durling
1;32;1-3;If I had harsh and clacking rhymes such as befit the dreadful hole toward which all other rocks point their weight,;durling
1;32;4-6;"I would press out the juice from my concept more fully; but because I lack them, not without fear do I bring myself to speak;";durling
1;32;7-9;for it is no task to take in jest, that of describing the bottom of the universe, nor one for a tongue that calls mommy or daddy.;durling
1;32;10-12;But let those ladies aid my verse who helped Amphion enclose Thebes, so that the word may not be different from the fact.;durling
1;32;13-15;Oh beyond all others ill-created throng who dwell in the place of which it is hard to speak, better had you here been sheep or goats!;durling
1;32;16-18;When we were down in the dark well, far below the giant’s feet, and I was still gazing at the high wall,;durling
1;32;19-21;I heard one say to me: “Watch how you step! Walk so that you do not trample with your feet the heads of your wretched weary brothers.”;durling
1;32;22-24;I turned then and saw before me and beneath my feet a lake to which icy cold gave the appearance of glass and not of water.;durling
1;32;25-27;So thick a veil was never made over its course by the Austrian Danube in winter, nor by the Don under its freezing sky,;durling
1;32;28-30;"as was there; and if Tamberlic should fall on it, or Pietrapana, at its edge it would not even creak.";durling
1;32;31-33;And as the frog sits croaking, with its muzzle out of the water, at the season when the peasant woman often dreams of gleaning,;durling
1;32;34-36;the grieving shades, livid, were in the ice up to where shame appears, playing the tune of the stork with their teeth.;durling
1;32;37-39;"Each held his face turned down; from their mouths the cold, from their eyes their wicked hearts exact testimony among them.";durling
1;32;40-42;When I had looked around myself a little, I looked down at my feet and saw two so pressed together that the hair of their heads was mingled.;durling
1;32;43-45;"“Tell me, you who so press your breasts together,” I said, “who are you?” And they bent back their necks; and when they had turned their sight up to me,";durling
1;32;46-48; their eyes, which had previously been wet within, dripped tears over their features, and the cold pressed the tears into the eyes and locked them up.;durling
1;32;49-51;"Board with board clamp never bound so tight; and they like two goats butted together, such anger overcame them.";durling
1;32;52-54;And one who had lost both ears to the freezing, still with his face turned down, said: “Why do you mirror yourself in us?;durling
1;32;55-57;If you want to know who those two are, the valley where the Bisenzio descends belonged to their father Albert and to them.;durling
1;32;58-60;"From one body they were born; and you can search through all Caina and not find a soul worthier to be fixed in gelatine,";durling
1;32;61-63;not him whose breast and shadow were pierced by one blow from the hand of Arthur, not Focaccia,;durling
1;32;64-66;not this one who so encumbers me with his head that I cannot see any further, and his name was Sassol Mascheroni: if you are Tuscan, you know who he was.;durling
1;32;67-69;"And so you won’t have me make any more speeches, know that I was Camiscion de’ Pazzi; and I await Carlino to excuse me.”";durling
1;32;70-72;Then I saw a thousand faces made doglike by the cold.;durling
1;32;73-75;And while we were walking to the center toward which all weight collects, and I was trembling in the cold, whence I shudder, and always shall, at frozen eternal chill,;durling
1;32;76-78;if it was wish or destiny or fortune, I do not know, but, pacing among the heads, I struck my foot hard in the face of one.;durling
1;32;79-81;Weeping it scolded me: “Why do you pound me? if you are not here to increase the vengeance for Montaperti, why do you bother me?”;durling
1;32;82-84;"And I: “My master, now wait for me here, so that I can be freed from a doubt by him; then you can hurry me as much as you will.”";durling
1;32;85-87;"My leader stopped; and I said to that one, who was still cursing violently: “Who are you, to reproach others so?”";durling
1;32;88-90;“Now who are you, to walk through Antenora striking,” he said, “others’ cheeks, so that, if you were alive, it would be too much to bear?”;durling
1;32;91-93;“I am alive, and it can be precious to you,” was my reply, “if you wish fame, that I place your name among my other notes.”;durling
1;32;94-96;And he to me: “The opposite is what I’m greedy for. Get up from here, and stop pestering me, for you flatter badly here in this swamp!”;durling
1;32;97-99;"Then I seized him by the scalp and said: “You will have to name yourself or not a hair will be left up here.""";durling
1;32;100-102;Then he to me: “Though you scalp me, I will not tell you who I am nor show you, though you fall on my head a thousand times.”;durling
1;32;103-105;I had already wrapped his hair around my hand and had torn out more than one tuft of it, he barking with his eyes kept down,;durling
1;32;106-108;"when another shouted: “What’s wrong with you, Bocca? isn’t it enough to play tunes with your jaws, that you have to bark, too?""";durling
1;32;109-111;“Now,” I said, “I don’t want you to say any more, wicked traitor, for to your shame I will carry back true news of you.”;durling
1;32;112-114;"“Get lost,” he replied, “and tell what you will; but do not be silent, if you escape from here, about him whose tongue was so loose just now.";durling
1;32;115-117;"He bewails the silver of the French here; ‘I saw,’ you can say, ‘him from Duera, down there where the sinners keep cool.’";durling
1;32;118-120;If you were asked, ‘Who else was there?’ beside you is that Beccheria whose throat-piece Florence sawed through.;durling
1;32;121-123;Gianni de’ Soldanier I believe is over there with Ganelon and Tebaldello, who opened Faenza when it slept.”;durling
1;32;124-126;"We had already left him, when I saw two frozen in one hole so that one head was a hat to the other;";durling
1;32;127-129;and as bread is eaten by the starving, so the one above put his teeth to the other, there where the brain joins the nape:;durling
1;32;130-132;not otherwise did Tydeus gnaw Menalippus’ temples in his rage, than this one did the skull and the other things.;durling
1;32;133-135;“O you who show by such a bestial sign your hatred over him you are eating, tell me why,” I said, “with this pact,;durling
1;32;136-138;that if you justly complain of him, when I know who you are and what his sin, in the world above I shall repay you for it,;durling
1;32;139-139;if that with which I speak does not dry up.”;durling
1;33;1-3;That sinner lifted up his mouth from his savage meal, wiping it on the hairs of the head he had wasted from behind.;durling
1;33;4-6;Then he began: “You wish me to renew desperate grief that already presses my heart merely thinking, before I speak of it.;durling
1;33;7-9;But if my words will be seed to bear the fruit of infamy for the traitor I gnaw, you will see me speak and weep together.;durling
1;33;10-12;"I know not who you are nor in what manner you have come down here; but truly, you seem to me a Florentine when I hear you.";durling
1;33;13-15;You are to know that I was Count Ugolino and this is the Archbishop Ruggieri: now I will tell you why I am such a neighbor to him.;durling
1;33;16-18;"That by effect of his evil thoughts, trusting him, I was taken and then killed, there is no need to say;";durling
1;33;19-21;but what you cannot have heard, that is, how cruel my death was, you shall hear, and you shall know if he has injured me.;durling
1;33;22-24;A small aperture within that mew which because of me has the name of Hunger, and where others must still be shut,;durling
1;33;25-27;had shown me through its opening several moons already, when I dreamed the evil dream that rent the veil of the future for me.;durling
1;33;28-30;This man appeared to me master and lord, hunting the wolf and his little cubs on the mountain for which the Pisans cannot see Lucca.;durling
1;33;31-33;With lean, eager, alert bitches, he had put Gualandi with Sismondi and Lanfranchi before his face.;durling
1;33;34-36;In brief course the father and his sons seemed to tire, and I seemed to see the sharp fangs tearing their flanks.;durling
1;33;37-39;When I awoke before the dawn, I heard my sons, who were with me, crying in their sleep and asking for bread.;durling
1;33;40-42;"You are surely cruel if you do not already grieve, thinking what my heart was announcing to me; and if you are not weeping, about what do you usually weep?";durling
1;33;43-45;"They were already awake, and the hour was drawing near when our food used to be brought to us, and each was afraid because of his dream;";durling
1;33;46-48;and I heard them nailing up the door at the base of the horrible tower, hence I looked into the faces of my sons without a word.;durling
1;33;49-51;"I was not weeping, I so turned to stone within: they were weeping; and my Anselmuccio said: “You have such a look, father! What is it?”";durling
1;33;52-54;Therefore I did not shed tears, nor did I reply all that day or the night after, until the next sun came forth into the world.;durling
1;33;55-57;When a little ray had entered our dolorous prison, and I perceived on four faces my own appearance,;durling
1;33;58-60;"both my hands I bit for rage; and they, thinking that I must be doing it out of a desire to eat, suddenly stood up";durling
1;33;61-63;and said: “Father, it will be much less pain for us if you eat of us: you clothed us with this wretched flesh, so do you divest us of it.”;durling
1;33;64-66;"I quieted myself then, so as not to make them sadder; that day and the next we were all mute: ah, hard earth, why did you not open?";durling
1;33;67-69;After we had reached the fourth day, Gaddo threw himself stretched out at my feet, saying: “My father, why do you not help me?”;durling
1;33;70-72;"Here he died; and as you see me, I saw the three fall one by one between the fifth day and the sixth; and I,";durling
1;33;73-75;already blind, took to groping over each of them, and for two days I called them, after they were dead. Then fasting had more power than grief.”;durling
1;33;76-78;When he had said that, with eyes askance he took the wretched skull in his teeth again, which were strong against the bone, like a dog’s.;durling
1;33;79-81;Ah, Pisa, shame of the peoples of the lovely land where si is spoken, since your neighbors are slow to punish you,;durling
1;33;82-84;let Capraia and Gorgona move and make a barrier at the mouth of Arno, so that it may drown every person in you!;durling
1;33;85-87;For if Count Ugolino was reported to have betrayed your fortresses, you should not have put his sons on such a cross.;durling
1;33;88-90;Their young age, O new Thebes, made Uguiccione and Brigata innocent, and the other two my song names above.;durling
1;33;91-93;We passed further, where the freezing rudely swathes another people, not bent over but with heads thrown back.;durling
1;33;94-96;"Weeping itself prevents weeping there, and the sorrow that finds a block over the eyes turns back within to increase the pain;";durling
1;33;97-99;for the first tears make a knot and, like crystal visors, fill all the cup below the brow.;durling
1;33;100-102;And although, as if by a callus, because of the cold every feeling had ended its stay on my face,;durling
1;33;103-105;"already I seemed to feel some wind; for which I: “My master, who moves this wind? Is not every vapor extinguished down here?”";durling
1;33;106-108;And he to me: “Soon you will be where your eye will give you the answer, when you see the cause raining down this breath.”;durling
1;33;109-111;And one of the grievers of the icy crust cried to me: “O souls so cruel that you are given the last place,;durling
1;33;112-114;lift from my eyes the hard veils, so that I may give vent a little to the anguish that gathers in my heart, before my tears freeze up again.”;durling
1;33;115-117;Therefore I to him: “If you wish me to help you, tell me who you are, and if I do not extricate you, may I have to go down to the bottom of the ice.”;durling
1;33;118-120;He replied therefore: “I am Brother Alberigo, I am he of the fruits of the evil orchard, and here I receive a date for every fig.”;durling
1;33;121-123;“Oh,” said I to him, “now are you already dead?” And he to me: “How my body may fare up in the world, I have no knowledge.;durling
1;33;124-126;Ptolomea has this advantage, that often the soul falls here before Atropos has sent it off.;durling
1;33;127-129;And that you may more willingly shave the glassy tears from my eyes, know that, as soon as the soul betrays;durling
1;33;130-132;"as I did, its body is taken over by a demon, who then governs it until his time has all revolved;";durling
1;33;133-135;"the soul falls down into this cistern. And perhaps the body still appears up there of the shade who is wintering here behind me;";durling
1;33;136-138;you must know of him, if you have just now come down here: he is Ser Branca Doria, and years have passed since he was closed in like that.”;durling
1;33;139-141;“I believe,” I told him, “that you are deceiving me, for Branca Doria is not yet dead, and he eats and drinks and sleeps and wears clothes.”;durling
1;33;142-144;“Up in the ditch,” he said, “of the Evil Claws, there where the sticky pitch is boiling, Michel Zanche had not yet arrived,;durling
1;33;145-147;when this one left a devil in his stead, in his body and that of a relative of his who committed the betrayal along with him.;durling
1;33;148-150;"But stretch out your hand to me now, open my eyes.” And I did not open them for him; and it was courtesy to treat him boorishly.";durling
1;33;151-153;Ah, men of Genoa, foreign to every decent usage, full of every vice, why have you not been exterminated from the world?;durling
1;33;154-156;For with the worst spirit of Romagna I found such a one of yours, that for his deeds in soul he already bathes in Cocytus,;durling
1;33;157-157;and in the body he seems still alive up above.;durling
1;34;1-3;"“Vexilla regis prodeunt inferni toward us; therefore look ahead,” said my master, “to see if you discern him.”";durling
1;34;4-6;As, when a thick mist breathes, or, when our hemisphere is all night, a mill appears from afar that the wind is turning:;durling
1;34;7-9;"so I seemed to see such an edifice there; then, because of the wind, I shrank behind my leader, for there was no other shelter.";durling
1;34;10-12;I was already—and fearfully I set it in meter—where the shades were all covered, and they appeared like straws in glass.;durling
1;34;13-15;"Some are lying; others are vertical, this with head above, that with feet; some, like bows, turn their faces toward their feet.";durling
1;34;16-18;When we had moved so far ahead that it pleased my master to show me the creature who had once been beautiful,;durling
1;34;19-21;he removed himself from in front of me and made me stop, saying: “Behold Dis, and behold the place where you must arm yourself with courage.”;durling
1;34;22-24;How then I became frozen and feeble, do not ask, reader, for I do not write it, and all speech would be insufficient.;durling
1;34;25-27;I did not die and I did not remain alive: think now for yourself, if you have wit at all, what I became, deprived of both.;durling
1;34;28-30;"The emperor of the dolorous kingdom issued from the ice at the mid-point of his breast; and I am more to be compared with a giant";durling
1;34;31-33;than the giants with his arms: see now how great must be the whole that fits with such a part.;durling
1;34;34-36;If he was as beautiful then as now he is ugly, when he lifted his brow against his Maker, well must all grieving proceed from him.;durling
1;34;37-39;"Oh how great a marvel did it seem to me, when I saw three faces on his head! One was in front, and that was crimson;";durling
1;34;40-42;the others were two, and they were joined to the first above the midpoint of each shoulder, and came together at the crest:;durling
1;34;43-45;"and the right one seemed between white and yellow; the left was such to see as those who come from beyond the cataracts of the Nile.";durling
1;34;46-48;Beneath each one came out two great wings, such as befitted so great a bird: sea-going sails I never saw so large.;durling
1;34;49-51;"They did not have feathers; their mode was like a bat’s; and he was fanning them, so that three winds went out from him:";durling
1;34;52-54;by them Cocytus was frozen. With six eyes he was weeping, and down three chins dripped the tears and the bloody slobber.;durling
1;34;55-57;In each of his mouths he was breaking a sinner with his teeth in the manner of a scutch, so that he made three suffer at once.;durling
1;34;58-60;To the one in front the biting was nothing next to the clawing, for at times the spine remained all naked of skin.;durling
1;34;61-63;“That soul up there who has the greatest punishment,” said my master, “is Judas Iscariot, with his head inside, waving his legs outside.;durling
1;34;64-66;Of the other two whose heads are below, he who hangs from the black muzzle is Brutus—see how he is convulsed, but does not say a word—;durling
1;34;67-69;and the other is Cassius, who seems so powerfully built. But the night is rising again, and now we must depart, for we have seen everything.”;durling
1;34;70-72;"As it pleased him, I clung to his neck; and he watched for time and place, and when the wings were fully open";durling
1;34;73-75;"he took hold of the furry sides; from tuft to tuft then he descended between the thick hair and the frozen crust.";durling
1;34;76-78;When we came to where the thigh is hinged, exactly at the widest of the hips, my leader, with labor and difficulty,;durling
1;34;79-81;turned his head to where he had his shanks, and clung to the pelt like one who climbs, so that I supposed we were returning into Hell again.;durling
1;34;82-84;“Hold fast, for by such stairs,” said my master, panting like one weary, “must we depart from so much evil.”;durling
1;34;85-87;"Next he went forth through the hole in the rock, and placed me sitting on the rim; then he extended his careful step to me.";durling
1;34;88-90;"I raised my eyes, thinking to see Lucifer as I had left him, and I saw that he extended his legs upward;";durling
1;34;91-93;and if I labored in thought then, let the gross people ponder it who do not see what point it was that I had passed.;durling
1;34;94-96;"“Rise up,” said my master, “on your feet; the way is long and the path is difficult, and already the sun has reached mid-tierce.”";durling
1;34;97-99;That was no walk through a palace where we were, but a natural cavern that had uneven ground and lacked light.;durling
1;34;100-102;“Before I am uprooted from the abyss, my master,” said I, when I was erect, “speak to me a little to help me out of error.;durling
1;34;103-105;Where is the ice? And he, how is he fixed so upside down? And how, in so little time, has the sun made the passage from evening to morning?”;durling
1;34;106-108;And he to me: “You imagine that you are still on the other side of the center, where I laid hold on the fur of this evil worm that gnaws the world.;durling
1;34;109-111;"You were on that side while I descended; when I turned, you passed the point toward which the weights all move from every direction.";durling
1;34;112-114;And now you are beneath the hemisphere opposite the one covered by the dry land, and under whose high point died;durling
1;34;115-117;"the man who was born and lived without sin; you have your feet on a little sphere that makes the other face of the Judecca.";durling
1;34;118-120;"Here it is morning, when there it is evening; and this one, who gave us a ladder with his fur, is still fixed as he was earlier.";durling
1;34;121-123;"On this side he fell down from Heaven; and the dry land, which previously extended over here, for fear of him took the sea as a veil,";durling
1;34;124-126;"and came to our hemisphere; and perhaps what does appear on this side left this empty space in order to escape from him, and fled upward.”";durling
1;34;127-129;There is a place down there, removed from Beelzebub as far as the width of his tomb, known not by sight, but by the sound;durling
1;34;130-132;of a little stream that descends through a hole in a rock eroded by its winding course, and it is not steep.;durling
1;34;133-135;"My leader and I entered on that hidden path to return to the bright world; and, without taking care for rest at all,";durling
1;34;136-138;up we climbed, he first and I second, until I saw the beautiful things the heavens carry, through a round opening.;durling
1;34;139-139;And thence we came forth to look again at the stars.;durling
1;11;1-3;Now near the brink of a sheer escarpment formed in a circle from great, shattered stones, we found, below, a crueller bunch of souls.;kirkpatrick
1;11;4-6;And there, against an awful overflow – a stink arising from the utmost depths – we huddled back together by the lid;kirkpatrick
1;11;7-9;of one vast sepulchre, inscribed, I saw, in words that said: ‘I guard Pope Anastasius, drawn by Photinus from the rightful road.’;kirkpatrick
1;11;10-12;‘Best not descend too rapidly, but first get more accustomed in our sense of smell to this grim belch. We’ll then not notice it.’;kirkpatrick
1;11;13-15;These were my teacher’s words. To him I said, ‘Find something that will compensate, to waste no time.’ ‘I’m thinking, as you see,’ he said,;kirkpatrick
1;11;16-18;and then began: ‘Dear son, within this rock-rimmed pit three lesser circuits lie. And these (like those you leave behind) go down by due degrees.;kirkpatrick
1;11;19-21;Each rung is crammed with spirits of the damned. But listen now – so sight may henceforth serve – and hear the “what” and “why” of their constraints.;kirkpatrick
1;11;22-24;Malice is aimed in all its forms – and thus incurs the hatred of Heaven – at gross injustice, and, aiming so, harms others, by deceit or force.;kirkpatrick
1;11;25-27;Deceit, though, is specifically a human wrong, and hence displeases God the more. Liars are therefore deeper down, and tortured worse.;kirkpatrick
1;11;28-30;Ring One throughout is meant for violent wills. But violent acts may fall upon three persons. And so this ring is shaped and formed in three.;kirkpatrick
1;11;31-33;To God, to self, to neighbours hurt is done (to persons, of course, but also their possessions) in ways that you will now hear argued out.;kirkpatrick
1;11;34-36;To those around us, death or grievous wounds are wrought by violent hands, the things we own ruined by outrage, extortion or fire.;kirkpatrick
1;11;37-39;So in the agonies of Sub-ring One, in different squads, are homicides and thugs, vandals and looters, bandits and brigands.;kirkpatrick
1;11;40-42;In violence, too, we turn against ourselves, or else our own belongings. And thus in Sub-ring Two are those (regret now vain);kirkpatrick
1;11;43-45;who by their own free will strip off your world or gamble all their competence away, and weep where, properly, they should rejoice.;kirkpatrick
1;11;46-48;Force, too, is offered to the Deity by hearts, blaspheming, that deny His power, or else scorn Nature and her great largesse.;kirkpatrick
1;11;49-51;And so the imprint of the smallest ring falls on Cahorsian bankers, as on Sodom, and those who speak at heart in scorn of God.;kirkpatrick
1;11;52-54;As for deceit – which gnaws all rational minds – we practise this on those who trust in us, or those whose pockets have no room for trust.;kirkpatrick
1;11;55-57;Fraud of the second kind will only gash the ligature of love that Nature forms: and therefore in great Circle Two there nests;kirkpatrick
1;11;58-60;smarm and hypocrisy, the casting-up of spells, impersonation, thievery, crooked priests, embezzlement and pimping, such-like scum.;kirkpatrick
1;11;61-63;Fraud of the other sort forgets no less the love that Nature makes, but then, as well, the love particular that trust creates.;kirkpatrick
1;11;64-66;So in the smallest ring of all – that point within the universe where Satan sits – consumed eternally, are traitors, every one.;kirkpatrick
1;11;67-69;‘Your explanation, sir,’ I said, ‘proceeds with great lucidity. You clarify the levels of this grim abyss and all within.;kirkpatrick
1;11;70-72;Yet tell me, too: those souls in that gross marsh, those swept by winds, those creatures lashed by rain, and those that clash with such abrasive tongues,;kirkpatrick
1;11;73-75;if they all, likewise, face the wrath of God, then why not racked within these flame-red walls? Or if they don’t, why are they as they are?’;kirkpatrick
1;11;76-78;‘Why,’ he replied, ‘do your frenetic wits wander so wildly from their usual track? Or where, if not fixed here, are your thoughts set?;kirkpatrick
1;11;79-81;Do you, at any rate, not call to mind the terms in which your Ethics fully treats those three dispositions that the Heavens repel:;kirkpatrick
1;11;82-84;intemperance, intentional harm and mad brutality? Or that intemperance offends God least, and least attracts His blame?;kirkpatrick
1;11;85-87;If you think carefully of what this means, and summon into thought what those souls are who serve their sentence in the upper ring,;kirkpatrick
1;11;88-90;you’ll plainly see why these are set apart from those condemned as felons, and, in pain, less sharply hammered by divine revenge.’;kirkpatrick
1;11;91-93;‘You are the sun who heals all clouded sight. Solving my doubts, you bring me such content that doubt, no less than knowing, is delight.;kirkpatrick
1;11;94-96;But still,’ I said, ‘turn backwards to the point where you declared that usury offends God’s generosity. Untie that knot.’;kirkpatrick
1;11;97-99;‘Philosophy, as those that read it know, takes note,’ he said, ‘on more than one occasion, of how the course that Nature runs is drawn;kirkpatrick
1;11;100-102;directly from the mind and art of God. And if you read your Physics with due care, you’ll see, before you’re many pages through,;kirkpatrick
1;11;103-105;that your art takes, as best it can, the lead that Nature gives – as student does from master. Your art is nearly grandchild, then, to God.;kirkpatrick
1;11;106-108;From these two principles – if you recall the opening lines of Genesis – we’re bound to draw our living strength and multiply our people.;kirkpatrick
1;11;109-111;But usurers adopt a different course. They place their hopes in other things, and thus make mock of Nature’s self and her close kin.;kirkpatrick
1;11;112-114;But follow on. I’m ready now to go. The writhing Fish have swum to the horizon. The Wain lies high above the Western Wind.;kirkpatrick
1;11;115-115;The leap we now must make lies far beyond.’;kirkpatrick
1;12;1-3;The place we’d reached – to clamber down that bank – was alpine crag. No eye, considering what else was there, would not have flinched away.;kirkpatrick
1;12;4-6;"Compare: an avalanche in Adige, southwards of Trent, once struck the mountain flank, triggered perhaps by landslip or earthquake;";kirkpatrick
1;12;7-9;and boulders from the summit shifted down in steps and stages to the valley floor, to offer those up there a downward route.;kirkpatrick
1;12;10-12;Likewise the path we trod down this ravine. And on the angle where the incline broke, there lay stretched out the infamy of Crete,;kirkpatrick
1;12;13-15;spawned in the womb of Pasiphae’s fake heifer. And when he saw us there he gnawed himself, as though flailed flat within by utter rage.;kirkpatrick
1;12;16-18;My leader in his wisdom called towards him: ‘You may suppose that he’s the duke of Athens, who dealt you, in the world above, your death.;kirkpatrick
1;12;19-21;You monster! Move aside! This one’s not come provided with instructions from your sister. He comes to see what you are suffering here.’;kirkpatrick
1;12;22-24;A stunned bull, stricken by its mortal blow, wrenches, that instant, free from noose and rope. It cannot walk but skips and hops about.;kirkpatrick
1;12;25-27;The Minotaur, I saw, behaved like that. ‘Run!’ shouted Virgil, watching out. ‘A gap! Better get down while still his fury bites.’;kirkpatrick
1;12;28-30;So down across the scree we picked our way. Beneath my feet, the stones would often move, teetering beneath the strange new weight they bore.;kirkpatrick
1;12;31-33;I walked on, deep in thought. ‘Perhaps,’ he said, ‘you’re thinking of this landslide? Or that guard whose brutal anger I have just eclipsed?;kirkpatrick
1;12;34-36;When once before (I’d like you now to know) I came down here and entered lower Hell, these cliffs had yet to suffer any rock fall.;kirkpatrick
1;12;37-39;But certainly, if I have got this right, there once came One who gathered up from Dis the stolen treasure of its highest place.;kirkpatrick
1;12;40-42;Moments before, a tremor in every part disturbed these fetid depths. The universe must then, I think, have felt that love through which;kirkpatrick
1;12;43-45;it often turns (so some suppose) to chaos. At that same point, these age-old crags were rent and left both here and elsewhere as they are.;kirkpatrick
1;12;46-48;But fix your eyes upon the valley floor. We now are nearing the river of blood. There simmer all whose violence damaged others.’;kirkpatrick
1;12;49-51;What blind cupidity, what crazy rage impels us onwards in our little lives – then dunks us in this stew to all eternity!;kirkpatrick
1;12;52-54;I saw there (as my guide had said I would) a ditch of great dimensions in an arc that stretched its wide embrace around the plain.;kirkpatrick
1;12;55-57;And there, between the hill foot and those banks, were centaurs, running in a long-drawn line, armed – as they’d been on earth to hunt – with arrows.;kirkpatrick
1;12;58-60;On seeing us descend, they all reined in. Three of that company then sallied forth, their barbs and bow strings already well picked.;kirkpatrick
1;12;61-63;And one, still distant, shouted out: ‘What pain have you to meet, now making down that butte? Tell us from there. Or else I draw my bow.’;kirkpatrick
1;12;64-66;My teacher in response then said: ‘To Chiron – there, just beside you – we shall make reply. You are too headstrong. And you always were.’;kirkpatrick
1;12;67-69;‘That’s Nessus there,’ he said, alerting me. ‘He died for love of lovely Deianira, but then avenged himself with his own blood.;kirkpatrick
1;12;70-72;The middle one (eyes fixed upon his chest) is Chiron the Great. He nurtured Achilles. Pholus, who lived so full of wrath, is third.;kirkpatrick
1;12;73-75;Around this ditch, in thousands these all run, and loose their arrows at those souls that strain higher beyond the blood than guilt allows.’;kirkpatrick
1;12;76-78;We drew now closer to those swift-foot beasts. Then Chiron plucked a shaft and, with its notch, he combed his beard and tucked it from his jaw.;kirkpatrick
1;12;79-81;And, once he’d made his noble mouth thus free, he said to his companions: ‘Have you seen the one behind, how all he touches moves?;kirkpatrick
1;12;82-84;A normal dead man’s feet would not do that.’ My trusted leader was now standing where, around the waist, the double nature weds.;kirkpatrick
1;12;85-87;He answered thus: ‘He is indeed alive. To me it falls to show him this dark vale. Necessity, not pleasure, leads us on.;kirkpatrick
1;12;88-90;Someone whose hymn is the “Alleluia” paused in that song to hand me this new task. He is no robber, I no thievish soul.;kirkpatrick
1;12;91-93;Now in the name of that True Power by which I move each step along this tangled way, allot a guide to us from your own band;kirkpatrick
1;12;94-96;to show us where the ford might be, and bear this man beside me on his crupper.’ He is no spirit walking through the air.;kirkpatrick
1;12;97-99;Now Chiron turned, to pivot to his right. ‘Go back!’ he said to Nessus. ‘Be their guide. Make any troop you stumble on give way.’;kirkpatrick
1;12;100-102;The escort by our side, we now moved on along the shore of boiling vermilion where souls, well boiled, gave vent to high-pitched yells.;kirkpatrick
1;12;103-105;Some, so I saw, were plunged there to the brow. ‘And these,’ the mighty centaur said, ‘are tyrants. They lent their hands to violent gain and blood.;kirkpatrick
1;12;106-108;So here, in tears for their unpitying sins, with Alexander there is vicious Dionysius, who brought on Sicily such grieving years.;kirkpatrick
1;12;109-111;That forehead there – its quiff as black as jet – is Azzolino. At his side the blond Opizzo d’Este, who – and this is true –;kirkpatrick
1;12;112-114;was done to death by his own bastard son.’ I turned towards the poet, who now said: ‘Let him go first and I’ll be next to come.’;kirkpatrick
1;12;115-117;A little further on, the centaur stopped, arched over people who emerged, it seemed, throat high above the seething of that stream.;kirkpatrick
1;12;118-120;There, to one side, he pointed out a shade. ‘He stabbed,’ he said, ‘in the bosom of God, the one whose heart drips blood still on the Thames.’;kirkpatrick
1;12;121-123;I now saw some with heads above the flood, then others further on, their torsos clear. And these, in greater numbers, I could recognize.;kirkpatrick
1;12;124-126;Then, gradually, the blood race grew more shallow – so that by now it only stewed their toes. And there we found the crossing of the ditch.;kirkpatrick
1;12;127-129;‘On this side – see? – the boiling stream grows less. So, correspondingly,’ the centaur said, ‘I’d have you understand that, over there,;kirkpatrick
1;12;130-132;the bed is pressed, in process point by point, still further down until it finds the place at which in pain great despots wring out moans.;kirkpatrick
1;12;133-135;Justice divine on that side sharply stings the Hun Attila – scourge of all the earth – Pyrrhus and Sextus. There it also milks;kirkpatrick
1;12;136-138;the tears eternally that boiling wave unlocks from Renier the Mad to Renier da Corneto, who wrought such strife upon the open roads.’;kirkpatrick
1;12;139-139;And then he turned and passed the ford once more.;kirkpatrick
1;13;1-3;No, Nessus had not reached the other side when we began to travel through a wood that bore no sign of any path ahead.;kirkpatrick
1;13;4-6;No fresh green leaves but murky in colour, no boughs clean arced but knotty and entwined, no apples were there but thorns, poison-pricked.;kirkpatrick
1;13;7-9;No scrubby wilderness so bitter and dense from Cécina as far as Corneto offers a den to beasts that hate ploughed farmlands.;kirkpatrick
1;13;10-12;Their nest is there, those disgusting Harpies who drove the Trojans from the Strophades, with grim announcements of great harm to come.;kirkpatrick
1;13;13-15;Wings widespreading, human from neck to brow, talons for feet, plumage around their paunches, they sing from these uncanny trees their songs of woe.;kirkpatrick
1;13;16-18;Constant in kindness, my teacher now said: ‘Before you venture further in, please know that you now stand in Sub-ring Number Two,;kirkpatrick
1;13;19-21;and shall until you reach the Appalling Sands. So look around. Take care. What you’ll see here would drain belief from any word I uttered.’;kirkpatrick
1;13;22-24;A wailing I heard, dragged out from every part, and saw there no one who might make these sounds, so that I stopped, bewildered, in my tracks.;kirkpatrick
1;13;25-27;Truly I think he truly thought that, truly, I might have, just, believed these voices rose from persons hiding from us in the thorn maze.;kirkpatrick
1;13;28-30;Therefore: ‘If you,’ my teacher said, ‘will wrench away some sprig from any tree you choose, that will lop short your feeling in such doubt.’;kirkpatrick
1;13;31-33;And so I reached my hand a little forwards. I plucked a shoot (no more) from one great hawthorn. At which its trunk screamed out: ‘Why splinter me?’;kirkpatrick
1;13;34-36;Now darkened by a flow of blood, the tree spoke out a second time: ‘Why gash me so? Is there no living pity in your heart?;kirkpatrick
1;13;37-39;Once we were men. We’ve now become dry sticks. Your hand might well have proved more merciful if we had been the hissing souls of snakes.’;kirkpatrick
1;13;40-42;Compare: a green brand, kindled at one end – the other oozing sap – whistles and spits as air finds vent, then rushes out as wind.;kirkpatrick
1;13;43-45;So now there ran, out of this fractured spigot, both words and blood. At which I let the tip drop down and stood like someone terror-struck.;kirkpatrick
1;13;46-48;‘You injured soul!’ my teacher (sane as ever) answered. ‘If he had only earlier believed what my own writings could have shown,;kirkpatrick
1;13;49-51;he’d not have stretched his hand so far towards you. This, though, is all beyond belief. So I was forced to urge a deed that presses on my own mind still.;kirkpatrick
1;13;52-54;But tell him now who once you were. He may, in turn, as remedy, refresh your fame, returning to the world above by leave.’;kirkpatrick
1;13;55-57;The trunk: ‘Your words, sir, prove so sweet a bait, I cannot here keep silence. Don’t be irked if I a while should settle on that lure and talk.;kirkpatrick
1;13;58-60;I am the one who held in hand both keys to Federigo’s heart. I turned them there, locking so smoothly and unlocking it;kirkpatrick
1;13;61-63;that all men, almost, I stole from his secrets. Faith I kept, so true in that proud office I wasted sleep and lost my steady pulse.;kirkpatrick
1;13;64-66;That harlot Scandal, then (her raddled eyes she never drags from where the emperor dwells, the vice of court life, mortal blight of all);kirkpatrick
1;13;67-69;inflamed the minds of everyone against me. And they in flames inflamed the great Augustus. So, happy honours turned to hapless grief.;kirkpatrick
1;13;70-72;My mind – itself disdainful in its tastes – believing it could flee disdain by dying, made me unjust against myself so just.;kirkpatrick
1;13;73-75;By all these weird, new-wooded roots, I swear on oath before you: I did not break faith, nor failed a lord so worthy of regard.;kirkpatrick
1;13;76-78;Will you – should either head back to the world – bring comfort to my memory, which lies still lashed beneath the stroke of envious eyes?’;kirkpatrick
1;13;79-81;Pausing a while, he said (my chosen poet), ‘He’s silent now, so waste no opportunity. If there is more you wish to know, then say.’;kirkpatrick
1;13;82-84;‘You,’ I replied, ‘must speak once more and ask what you believe will leave me satisfied. I could not do it. Pity wrings my core.’;kirkpatrick
1;13;85-87;And so he did once more begin: ‘Suppose that freely, from a generous heart, someone should do, imprisoned ghost, what your prayers seek,;kirkpatrick
1;13;88-90;tell us, if you should care to, this: how souls are bound in these hard knots. And, if you can: will anyone be ever loosed from limbs like these?’;kirkpatrick
1;13;91-93;At that (exhaling heavily) the trunk converted wind to word and formed this speech: ‘The answer you require is quick to give:;kirkpatrick
1;13;94-96;When any soul abandons savagely its body, rending self by self away, Minos consigns it to the seventh gulf.;kirkpatrick
1;13;97-99;Falling, it finds this copse. Yet no one place is chosen as its plot. Where fortune slings it, there (as spelt grains might) it germinates.;kirkpatrick
1;13;100-102;A sapling sprouts, grows ligneous, and then the Harpies, grazing on its foliage, fashion sharp pain and windows for that pain.;kirkpatrick
1;13;103-105;We (as shall all), come Judgement Day, shall seek our cast-off spoil, yet not put on this vestment. Keeping what we tore off would not be fair.;kirkpatrick
1;13;106-108;"Our bodies we shall drag back here; and all around this melancholy grove they’ll swing, each on the thorn of shades that wrought them harm.’";kirkpatrick
1;13;109-111;Attention trained entirely on that stock (thinking, in truth, it might as yet say more), we now were shocked by a sudden uproar,;kirkpatrick
1;13;112-114;as if (to make comparison) you’d heard some hog and all the boar hunt baying round its stand – a sound composed of beasts and thrashing twigs.;kirkpatrick
1;13;115-117;And look there, on the left-hand side, there came, at speed, two fleeing, naked, scratched to bits, who broke down every hurdle in that scrub.;kirkpatrick
1;13;118-120;One was ahead: ‘Quick, quick! Come, death! Come now!’ The other (seeming, to himself, too slow) was yelling: ‘Lano! Oh, your nimble heels;kirkpatrick
1;13;121-123;weren’t half so nifty at the Toppo rumble!’ And then (it may be his breath was failing), he sank to form a clump beside a shrub.;kirkpatrick
1;13;124-126;Behind these two, the wood was teeming, full of black bitches, ravenous and rapid, as greyhounds are when slipping from their leads.;kirkpatrick
1;13;127-129;These set their teeth on that sad, hunkered form. They tore him all to pieces, chunk by chunk. And then they carried off those suffering limbs.;kirkpatrick
1;13;130-132;My guide then took me gently by the hand, and led me to the bush, which wept (in vain) through all of its blood-stained lacerations,;kirkpatrick
1;13;133-135;saying: ‘O Jacopo da Santo Andrea! What use was it to take me as your shield? Am I to blame for your wild, wicked ways?’;kirkpatrick
1;13;136-138;My teacher came and stood above that bush. ‘So who were you,’ he said, ‘who, pierced to bits, breathes painful utterance in jets of blood?’;kirkpatrick
1;13;139-141;‘You souls,’ he said, ‘you come – but just in time – to see the massacre, in all its shame, that rends away from me my fresh green fronds.;kirkpatrick
1;13;142-144;Place all these leaves beneath this grieving stump. I too was from that city, once, which chose Saint John as patron over Mars – its first –;kirkpatrick
1;13;145-147;whose arts, since spurned, have always brought us harm. And were there not, beneath the Arno bridge, some traces visible of what he was,;kirkpatrick
1;13;148-150;those citizens who built it all anew on ashes that Attila left behind would then have laboured with no end in view.;kirkpatrick
1;13;151-151;Myself, I made a gallows of my house.’;kirkpatrick
1;14;1-3;Seized, in pure charity, by love of home, I gathered up those scattered leaves, then bore them towards my countryman, his voice grown dim.;kirkpatrick
1;14;4-6;And then, from there, we reached the boundary of circuits two and three and witnessed now, in horror and awe, how skilful justice is.;kirkpatrick
1;14;7-9;To make more manifest what now was new, we’d reached, I’d better say, an open plain that dusts all vegetation from its floor.;kirkpatrick
1;14;10-12;Round this, the wood of pain creates a fringe (as likewise, round that wood, the wretched ditch). And here we halted at the very edge.;kirkpatrick
1;14;13-15;The ground beneath was brushed with coarse, dry sand, no different from those arid Libyan wastes on which the feet of Cato marched to war.;kirkpatrick
1;14;16-18;Great God! Your vengeance must be rightly feared by all who read the verses I compose to say what there was straight before my eyes.;kirkpatrick
1;14;19-21;I saw ahead a flock of naked souls. And all were weeping, very mournfully. But each was subject to a different law.;kirkpatrick
1;14;22-24;Some of these folk lay supine on the ground, and some sat huddling, tight about themselves. Others again strode endlessly around.;kirkpatrick
1;14;25-27;The latter were, in number, far the more. Those lying flat, though fewer, were in tongue more free at voicing their sharp miseries.;kirkpatrick
1;14;28-30;And over all that barren sand there fell – as slow as Alpine snow on windless days – a shower of broad-winged fire flakes drifting down.;kirkpatrick
1;14;31-33;Recall how Alexander, on his march across the climes of scorching India, saw clouds of fire that fell around his troops;kirkpatrick
1;14;34-36;and reached the earth still whole. He therefore made his squadrons stamp the ground, since, broken down, these vapours proved far easier to quell.;kirkpatrick
1;14;37-39;So, too, eternally, the flames fell here. The sand caught fire, like tinder under flint, and doubled – from beneath – the upper punishment.;kirkpatrick
1;14;40-42;Unrestingly, their wretched hands jived on – now up, now down, now high, now low, slap, clap! – to shake fresh drops of ardour from their skin.;kirkpatrick
1;14;43-45;So I began: ‘You, sir, in everything have conquered all, though not those demons, hard-faced at the gate of Dis, who stopped us on that step.;kirkpatrick
1;14;46-48;That hero there, who’s he? Heedless he seems of these incendiaries. Scowling in scorn, it seems he lies unripened by the rain.’;kirkpatrick
1;14;49-51;The man himself roared forth (for he had seen that I, in questioning my lord, meant him): ‘What I, once living, was, so dead I am.;kirkpatrick
1;14;52-54;"Yes! Jupiter may tire the blacksmith out from whom he tore in wrath the thunder spear by which I stood, on my last day, drilled through;";kirkpatrick
1;14;55-57;and others, too, he may exhaust, in shifts that stoke that black forge under Mount Jabal, bellowing: “Vulcan! Aid, more aid! Good man!”;kirkpatrick
1;14;58-60;just as he did when battle raged at Flegra, and loose his bolts at me with all his force… But no! No sweet revenge he’d have on me!’;kirkpatrick
1;14;61-63;My leader then spoke out with greater strength than ever I, till then, had heard him use: ‘Oh, Capaneus! Pride yet uninterred!;kirkpatrick
1;14;64-66;This punishment, in consequence, is yours. No agony, except your own great rage, would serve as proper answer to your ire.’;kirkpatrick
1;14;67-69;And then – a better look around his lips – he turned to me. ‘This man,’ he said, ‘a king, was one of seven laying siege to Thebes.;kirkpatrick
1;14;70-72;God he disdained – he seems to, still – and seemed to pay Him scant regard. So, as I said: disdain alone must be his sole medallion.;kirkpatrick
1;14;73-75;And now keep close behind. Take every care. Do not set foot upon these blistering sands. Follow the wood’s verge round at every step.’;kirkpatrick
1;14;76-78;In silence now, continuing, we came to where a rill flows spurting from the grove. Remembering its redness, I still squirm.;kirkpatrick
1;14;79-81;As in Viterbo there’s the Bubble Brook – which scarlet women, bathing, share between them – so this stream took its course across the sand.;kirkpatrick
1;14;82-84;That rivulet, in bed and bank, was formed of stone, as also were the margins by its side. This, I could tell, was where our best path lay.;kirkpatrick
1;14;85-87;‘Among so many other things that I – since entering the gate through which no foot is ever disallowed an entry –;kirkpatrick
1;14;88-90;have shown to you, nothing your eyes have spied has been more notable than this stream here, above which all the sparks grow dim and die.’;kirkpatrick
1;14;91-93;These were the words my leader spoke to me. And I besought him, through his great largesse, to grant the food in granting me the hunger.;kirkpatrick
1;14;94-96;‘Mid-sea,’ he said, ‘there lies a land now waste. To us, this land is known as Crete, where once, when Saturn ruled as king, the world was chaste.;kirkpatrick
1;14;97-99;A mountain stands there, Idaeus its name. This, once, rejoiced in streams and leafy fronds, but now stands abandoned like forbidden ground.;kirkpatrick
1;14;100-102;Once, Rhea – seeking for a sanctuary – chose here to lay her boy child, Jove. And then, to hide his wailings, called for dance and din.;kirkpatrick
1;14;103-105;Within those caves an aged man stands tall. His back is turned to Egypt and Damiatta. Rome is the mirror into which he stares.;kirkpatrick
1;14;106-108;His head is modelled in the finest gold. Of purest silver are his arms and breast. Then downwards to the fork he’s brightest brass,;kirkpatrick
1;14;109-111;and all below is iron of choicest ore. The right foot, though, is formed of terracotta. On that he puts more weight than on the left.;kirkpatrick
1;14;112-114;And every part that is not gold is cracked. Tears through this single fissure drizzle down, then, mingling, penetrate the cavern wall.;kirkpatrick
1;14;115-117;Their rocky course cascades to this deep hollow. They form the Acheron, Styx and Phlegethon. These then disgorge themselves through this tight race,;kirkpatrick
1;14;118-120;until (since there is no way further on) they all collect as Cocytus. But you yourself will see that pool. So I’ll not tell the tale.’;kirkpatrick
1;14;121-123;‘If,’ I now put to him, ‘this gutter flows from somewhere in our human world, then why do we just see it at this selvage hem?’;kirkpatrick
1;14;124-126;‘You know,’ he said, ‘this place is circular. Yet, far as you have sunk in your descent, your path has always tended to the left.;kirkpatrick
1;14;127-129;"So you have still not spanned the circle round; and if new things now show themselves to us, it should not stir amazement on your brow.’";kirkpatrick
1;14;130-132;And I kept on at him: ‘And so, sire, where are Phlegethon and Lethe found? The one, you say, rains down in tears. The other you are silent of.’;kirkpatrick
1;14;133-135;‘By everything you ask,’ he said, ‘I’m pleased. And yet, as one solution, you should note the seething redness of the waters here.;kirkpatrick
1;14;136-138;Lethe you’ll see, but far beyond this ditch. Its waves are where the soul will go to wash, when guilt, repented, is at last removed.’;kirkpatrick
1;14;139-141;And then: ‘It’s time for you to leave this wood. So come. Keep close behind me as you do. The banks, which are not burned, provide a road.’;kirkpatrick
1;14;142-142;And above them every flame is extinguished.”;kirkpatrick
1;15;1-3;We’re carried down by one of those hard shores, while vapours from the brook rise, arching up, to save both stream and margins from the fire.;kirkpatrick
1;15;4-6;Flemings, enflamed – from Wissant on to Bruges – in terror of the floods that blast towards them, construct great screens to put the sea to flight.;kirkpatrick
1;15;7-9;So, too, the Paduans, along the Brent, attempt to shield their castles and estates, before its source (Carinthia) is touched by heat.;kirkpatrick
1;15;10-12;Modelled on some original like these (whatever master hand contrived them so) these breaks were formed, though not that high or broad.;kirkpatrick
1;15;13-15;By now, we’d left the grove so far behind that, even had I turned around to look, I’d not have glimpsed the tract where it was found.;kirkpatrick
1;15;16-18;But here we came across a band of souls who milled around the ditch and met our tread. And each one peered at us – as people will;kirkpatrick
1;15;19-21;on evenings when the moon is new – their brows towards us, wrinkled into squinting blades, like those of some old tailor at his needle.;kirkpatrick
1;15;22-24;Eyed up and down so closely by this clan, I now was recognized, as known, by one who plucked my hem and cried: ‘How marvellous!’;kirkpatrick
1;15;25-27;And I – as he then stretched an arm towards me – fixed eyes so keenly through his fire-baked look that these singed features could not fend away;kirkpatrick
1;15;28-30;my mind from knowing, truly, who he was. And, reaching down a hand towards his face, I answered him: ‘Brunetto, sir, are you here?’;kirkpatrick
1;15;31-33;‘Do not, my dearest son,’ he said, ‘be vexed, but let Brunetto Latino turn and walk a while along with you. The troops can run!’;kirkpatrick
1;15;34-36;‘I pray, sir, to the utmost, do. Or should you wish,’ I said, ‘I’ll sit with you, so long as this man here agrees. I go with him.’;kirkpatrick
1;15;37-39;‘Dear boy,’ he said, ‘if any in this herd should ever pause, he lies a hundred years powerless to fan these searing fires away.;kirkpatrick
1;15;40-42;And so move on. I’ll follow at your coat-tails then catch up later with that entourage, which, as it goes, bewails eternal loss.’;kirkpatrick
1;15;43-45;I did not dare climb down to quit the causeway and walk with him on equal terms. But still, as though in reverence, I kept my head bowed low.;kirkpatrick
1;15;46-48;‘What chance or destiny,’ he then began, ‘leads you down here before your final day? And who is this that shows the way to you?’;kirkpatrick
1;15;49-51;‘There, up above,’ I answered him, ‘where life is halcyon, I lost myself – my path all blurred – in some great deep before my years were full.;kirkpatrick
1;15;52-54;Only as dawn rose, yesterday, I turned aside. Then he – as yet again I turned – appeared, and guides me on the road back home.’;kirkpatrick
1;15;55-57;‘If,’ so he answered, ‘you pursue your star, then doubtless you will reach a glorious goal, supposing, in the happy life, I knew you well.;kirkpatrick
1;15;58-60;And I myself (had not I died too soon), seeing how kind the Heavens looked on you, would willingly have helped you in your work.;kirkpatrick
1;15;61-63;But that malignant and ungrateful race descending ab antico from Fiesole (they still retain the taint of crag and hill);kirkpatrick
1;15;64-66;will act, because you act so well, as bitter foes. That much is logical: no luscious fig can rightly thrive where small, sour sorbus grows.;kirkpatrick
1;15;67-69;The world, since ancient times, has known they’re blind. The tribe is grasping, envious and proud. Keep yourself clean of habits of their kind.;kirkpatrick
1;15;70-72;Fortune for you reserves such great renown that both these factions – Black and White – will seek to set their teeth in you. Keep goats from grass!;kirkpatrick
1;15;73-75;Well may these cattle from Fiesole make themselves straw but never touch the sprout that springs (if any does within their dung);kirkpatrick
1;15;76-78;to bring to life the sacred seed of Rome – of those remaining when that ancient place became the very home and nest of malice.’;kirkpatrick
1;15;79-81;‘If all,’ I said to him, ‘that I might ask were answered, and in full, then you would not be exiled, as you are, from human nature.;kirkpatrick
1;15;82-84;Fixed in my thoughts, and working at my heart, an image of you still endures – a dear, good father – as, in the world, you were when hour by hour;kirkpatrick
1;15;85-87;you taught me how a man becomes eternal. How great my gratitude must be, will show, while I still live, in all my tongue will tell.;kirkpatrick
1;15;88-90;I write, as you recount it here, the story of my future course, and keep your words with others. A lady, if I come to her, will comment.;kirkpatrick
1;15;91-93;On this point only I would have you clear: that I, so long as conscience does not chide, am well prepared for all that Fortune wills.;kirkpatrick
1;15;94-96;In what you vouch, my ears hear nothing new. Let Fortune, therefore, do as Fortune pleases – whirl at her wheel like yokels at their hoe.’;kirkpatrick
1;15;97-99;My teacher, who had now turned right-about, looked back at me and fixed me with his eye. ‘Those listen well,’ he said, ‘who take good note.’;kirkpatrick
1;15;100-102;So on I go, speaking with lawyer Brunetto. I ask who his companions are, the great and good, the eminent, and men of note.;kirkpatrick
1;15;103-105;‘Of some,’ he said, ‘you’re right to want to know. More laudable of others not to speak. Our time would be too short for all that din.;kirkpatrick
1;15;106-108;But all of them, be sure, were men of learning, authorities and dons of world renown, besmirched, when living, with the self-same sin.;kirkpatrick
1;15;109-111;And so, among this dismal crowd, runs Priscian. D’Accorso, too – the Prof. And if you yearn to set your eyes on such-like mangy scabs,;kirkpatrick
1;15;112-114;you could. That bishop there! The Slave of Slaves transferred him to Vicenza from the Arno. He left his muscles, ill-distended, there.;kirkpatrick
1;15;115-117;I would say more. Yet further I may not advance nor any longer talk with you. I see new smoke there, rising from the sand.;kirkpatrick
1;15;118-120;I can’t consort with those who now draw near. My Treasury – may that commend itself. In that, I still live on. I ask no more.’;kirkpatrick
1;15;121-123;Around he swung. To me he seemed like one who, in the fields around Verona, runs for that fine prize, a length of green festoon.;kirkpatrick
1;15;124-124;He seemed to be the one that wins, not loses.;kirkpatrick
1;16;1-3;I stood already where the roar and boom of waters falling to the next great ring could now be heard – a rumble like a beehive.;kirkpatrick
1;16;4-6;But then appeared, together, at the run, three shadows, swerving from a further squad of those in rasping torment from the rain.;kirkpatrick
1;16;7-9;Towards us, as they came, each cried aloud: ‘Stop there! To us, it seems, you’re dressed like one who travels from our own degenerate homeland.’;kirkpatrick
1;16;10-12;No! No! I saw how branded by the bite of fire their limbs all were. New wounds! Old scars! This, though mere memory, still brings me pain.;kirkpatrick
1;16;13-15;My teacher paused, attending to their cries. And then, his eyes on me, he said: ‘Now wait. We owe to these men here some courtesy.;kirkpatrick
1;16;16-18;Indeed, were not the nature of this place to shoot down barbs of fire, then haste (I’d say) should properly be shown by you, not them.’;kirkpatrick
1;16;19-21;And so again, as now we came to rest, they all began the song they’d sung before and, turning, formed among themselves a wheel.;kirkpatrick
1;16;22-24;Compare: prize wrestlers, with their bare skin oiled, circle – until they clash, then punch and gouge – in search of some advantage, grip or hold.;kirkpatrick
1;16;25-27;These likewise. As they wheeled around, each fixed their glances hard on me. And so their necks turned counter always to the track they trod.;kirkpatrick
1;16;28-30;‘The misery,’ thus one began, ‘of these vile sands may render us, and all our prayers, contemptible, our faces, too, now black and burned.;kirkpatrick
1;16;31-33;But let our reputations bend your heart. And who are you – now tell – whose living step, in perfect safety, scours the paths of Hell?;kirkpatrick
1;16;34-36;This man, whose prints my own feet trample on, although he now goes naked, shorn of hair, was once of higher rank than you’d imagine.;kirkpatrick
1;16;37-39;Grandson by birth of our good Gualdrada, he was, by title, Conte Guido Guerra. Much he achieved alive with mind and sword.;kirkpatrick
1;16;40-42;The other next to him who flails the sand is Lord Tegghiaio of the Aldobrands. He ought to have more pleased the world in word.;kirkpatrick
1;16;43-45;I, in excruciating pain with them, was Iacopo Rusticucci. And, yes, it was my wife who did me greatest harm.’;kirkpatrick
1;16;46-48;If only I’d had cover from the fire, I’d willingly have flung myself among them. (I think my teacher would have suffered this.);kirkpatrick
1;16;49-51;But since, down there, I’d soon have singed and baked, fear got the better of the good intent that stirred my appetite for their embrace.;kirkpatrick
1;16;52-54;So I began: ‘Great grief, not scornfulness, to see your state was planted in my heart (and only slowly will it shed its leaves);kirkpatrick
1;16;55-57;the instant that my lord, in words to me, led all my inner thoughts to understand that persons such as you might soon come by.;kirkpatrick
1;16;58-60;I am of your place, too. So, I have heard – and always with affection have proclaimed – the deeds you’ve done and honour of your name.;kirkpatrick
1;16;61-63;I now take leave of galling fruits, to seek sweet apples, promised by my lord in truth, but first must reach the centre of the circle.’;kirkpatrick
1;16;64-66;‘Long may your soul lead forth your living limbs!’ So, in reply, said one of them. ‘And – grant your fame may long shine after you! – then say:;kirkpatrick
1;16;67-69;do courtesy and valour dwell, as once they did, within the circuit of our city walls? Or have they utterly departed thence?;kirkpatrick
1;16;70-72;Report of this, from courtly Borsiere (who only joined us here of late, and goes with our companions there), has caused us pain.’;kirkpatrick
1;16;73-75;‘That race of newly rich, and rapid gains, these seeds, Fiorenza, bring to flower in you excess and pride. And you already weep for that.’;kirkpatrick
1;16;76-78;With head thrown back, I cried this, all aloud, and they, the three (accepting this response), glanced each to each like those who’ve heard plain truth.;kirkpatrick
1;16;79-81;‘If at so little cost,’ they said, ‘you speak so well and satisfy what others seek, then you may happily pronounce at will.;kirkpatrick
1;16;82-84;And so, should you escape from these dark haunts, and go once more to see the lovely stars, when you, with pleasure, say that “I was there”,;kirkpatrick
1;16;85-87;then do, we beg you, speak of us to others.’ With this they broke their wheel and, as they fled, their agile limbs in flight were quick as wings.;kirkpatrick
1;16;88-90;No ‘amen’ ever was so swiftly said as these three disappeared before our eyes. And now my teacher thought that we could leave.;kirkpatrick
1;16;91-93;I came behind. But now, not travelling far, the sound of the water was so near at hand that we could scarcely hear each other speak.;kirkpatrick
1;16;94-96;Compare: a river, near its native source, runs through the eastern Apennines due east, and first descends the slopes of Monte Viso.;kirkpatrick
1;16;97-99;Its tranquil name up there is Acqua Cheta. But then, on flowing to its lower bed, at Forlì it assumes a different mode,;kirkpatrick
1;16;100-102;and thunders here, in one great bound, above the Alp Saint Benedict, where – were it eased from ledge to ledge – the height would need a thousand.;kirkpatrick
1;16;103-105;So, likewise, down through one great shattered force, we found, resounding there, a blackened stream – the din of which would soon have stunned our ears.;kirkpatrick
1;16;106-108;Around my waist I wore a braided cord, and had on past occasion thought, by this, to snare the leopard with its painted hide.;kirkpatrick
1;16;109-111;My leader told me I should slip this off. And when I’d got it wound from round my waist, I handed it across in twisted knots.;kirkpatrick
1;16;112-114;And then he turned towards his right-hand side, and flung it, bunched, some distance from the bank. It fell, to find the depths of that great sink.;kirkpatrick
1;16;115-117;‘Astounding things,’ I told myself, ‘are bound to come at this astounding sign, which now my master follows with his waiting eye.’;kirkpatrick
1;16;118-120;How cautious we must always be when faced with those who, far beyond observing deeds, can gaze in wisdom on our very thoughts.;kirkpatrick
1;16;121-123;So now he said: ‘There soon shall rise what I expect (what you in thought now dream) will come. All shall be, soon, uncovered to your eyes.’;kirkpatrick
1;16;124-126;Always, to every truth that looks, in face, like lies, one ought (quite firmly) bar the lip lest, guiltless, what one says should still bring shame.;kirkpatrick
1;16;127-129;I cannot, though, be silent here. Reader, I swear by every rhyme this comedy has caused to chime (may it not lack long favour);kirkpatrick
1;16;130-132;that now, through dark and fatty air, I saw – to strike sheer wonder in the steadiest heart – approaching us a figure swimming up,;kirkpatrick
1;16;133-135;as any diver might who’d gone below to loose an anchor snagged on rocks (or something other, hidden in the sea) and now comes back,;kirkpatrick
1;16;136-136;arms stretching high, legs drawn to make the stroke.;kirkpatrick
1;17;1-3;‘Behold! The beast who soars with needle tail through mountains, shattering shields and city walls! Behold! The beast that stinks out all the world!’;kirkpatrick
1;17;4-6;To me, my lord spoke thus, then beckoned up the monster to approach the jutting prow that marked the end of all our marble paths.;kirkpatrick
1;17;7-9;It came, that filthy image of deceit. Its head and trunk it grounded on the shore. It did not draw its tailpiece to the bank.;kirkpatrick
1;17;10-12;The face was that of any honest man, the outer skin all generosity. Its timber, though, was serpent through and through:;kirkpatrick
1;17;13-15;two clawing grabs, and hairy to the armpits, its back and breast and ribcage all tattooed with knot designs and spinning little whorls.;kirkpatrick
1;17;16-18;No Turk or Tartar wove a finer drape, more many-coloured in its pile or tuft. Nor did Arachne thread such tapestries.;kirkpatrick
1;17;19-21;Compare: on foreshores, sometimes, dinghies stand in water partly, partly on the shingle – as likewise, in the land of drunken Germans,;kirkpatrick
1;17;22-24;beavers will do, advancing their attack. So did this beast – the worst that there can be – there on the rocky rim that locks the sand.;kirkpatrick
1;17;25-27;Out into emptiness it swung its tail, and twisted upwards its venomous fork. The tip was armed like any scorpion’s.;kirkpatrick
1;17;28-30;My leader said: ‘We need to bend our path a little further down, towards that vile monstrosity that’s lolling underneath.’;kirkpatrick
1;17;31-33;So down we went, towards the right-hand pap. Ten paces, and we’d reached the very edge, stepping well clear of flames and burning shoals.;kirkpatrick
1;17;34-36;And then, on getting to that spot, I saw, a little further on along the sandbar, a group just sitting near the gaping waste.;kirkpatrick
1;17;37-39;And here my teacher said: ‘To carry back experience of the ring that we’re now in, go over there and look at their behaviour.;kirkpatrick
1;17;40-42;But do not stay to talk at any length. Till you return, I’ll parley with this thing, for him to grant us use of his great thews.’;kirkpatrick
1;17;43-45;So once again, along the outward brow of Circle Seven I progressed alone to where there sat these souls in misery.;kirkpatrick
1;17;46-48;The pain they felt erupted from their eyes. All up and down and round about, their hands sought remedies for burning air and ground.;kirkpatrick
1;17;49-51;Dogs in the heat of summer do the same, stung by the bluebottle, gadfly and flea, swatting at swarms with paw pads or with snout.;kirkpatrick
1;17;52-54;On some of these – these faces under showers of grievous, never-ceasing rain – I set my eyes. I recognized no single one, but noticed;kirkpatrick
1;17;55-57;around the neck of each a cash bag hung (each with its own insignia and blaze), on which their staring eyes appeared to graze.;kirkpatrick
1;17;58-60;So I, too, gazing, passed among them all, and saw, imprinted on a yellow purse, a blue device, in face and pose a lion.;kirkpatrick
1;17;61-63;Then, as my view went trundling further on, I saw another, with a blood-red field – the goose it bore was whiter, far, than butter.;kirkpatrick
1;17;64-66;And then I heard (from one whose neat, white sack was marked in azure with a pregnant sow): ‘What are you after in this awful hole?;kirkpatrick
1;17;67-69;Do go away! Yet you – as Vitaliano is – are still alive. Then understand me, please: he’ll sit on my left flank, my one-time neighbour.;kirkpatrick
1;17;70-72;I’m Paduan, among these Florentines, and often they all thunder in my ears: “Oh, let him come,” they’ll scream, “that sovereign knight,;kirkpatrick
1;17;73-75;who’ll bring the bag that bears three rampant goats.”’ At which, in throes, he wrenched his mouth awry and ox-like curled his tongue to lick his nose.;kirkpatrick
1;17;76-78;And I, who feared that, if I lingered long, I’d irritate the one who’d said ‘Be brief’, now turned my back upon these worn-out souls.;kirkpatrick
1;17;79-81;My leader, I discovered there, had jumped already on that fearsome creature’s rump. ‘Come on,’ he urged, ‘be stalwart and courageous.;kirkpatrick
1;17;82-84;From now on we’ll descend by stairs like these. Mount at the front so I can come between, to see the tail won’t bring you any harm.’;kirkpatrick
1;17;85-87;Like someone shivering as the grip of flu spreads over him, pale to the fingernails, who trembles merely at the sight of shade…;kirkpatrick
1;17;88-90;well, that was me, as these words carried over. The threat of shame, however, when one’s lord is near, emboldens one to serve him well.;kirkpatrick
1;17;91-93;I settled down between those gruesome shoulders. I wished to say (my voice, though, would not come): ‘Yes. Please! Be sure you hold me very firm.’;kirkpatrick
1;17;94-96;He, who in many an earlier ‘perhaps’ had aided me, as soon as I got on, flinging his arms around me, hugged me tight,;kirkpatrick
1;17;97-99;and said: ‘Go on, then, Geryon. Cast out! Wheel wide about to make a smooth descent. Think of the strange new burden on your back.’;kirkpatrick
1;17;100-102;Slowly astern, astern, as ferries leave the quay where they had docked, so he moved out. Then, only when he felt himself ride free,;kirkpatrick
1;17;103-105;he turned the tail where breast had been before, and – stretching long, as eels might do – set sail, paddling the air towards him with his paws.;kirkpatrick
1;17;106-108;No greater fear (so, truly, I believe) was felt as Phaeton let the reins go loose, and scorched the sky as still it is today,;kirkpatrick
1;17;109-111;nor yet by ill-starred Icarus – his loins unfeathering as the wax grew warm – to whom his father screamed aloud: ‘You’re going wrong!’;kirkpatrick
1;17;112-114;And then with fear I saw, on every side, that I was now in air, and every sight extinguished, save my view of that great beast.;kirkpatrick
1;17;115-117;So swimming slowly, it goes on its way. It wheels. It descends. This I don’t notice – except an upward breeze now fans my face.;kirkpatrick
1;17;118-120;By then I heard, beneath us to the right, the roar of some appalling cataract. And so I leant my head out, looking down.;kirkpatrick
1;17;121-123;More timorous of falling still, I saw that there were fires down there and heard shrill screams. Trembling, I huddled back and locked my thighs.;kirkpatrick
1;17;124-126;And then I saw, as I had not before, the going-down – the spirals of great harm – on every side now coming ever nearer.;kirkpatrick
1;17;127-129;A falcon, having long been on the wing, and seeing neither lure nor bird to prey on, compels the falconer to sigh: ‘You’re coming in,’;kirkpatrick
1;17;130-132;then sinks down wearily to where it left so fast. A hundred turns – and then, far from its lord, it lands, disdainful, spiteful in its scorn.;kirkpatrick
1;17;133-135;So, too, did Geryon, to place us on the floor, the very foot of that sheer, towering cliff. And then, unburdened of our persons now,;kirkpatrick
1;17;136-136;vanished at speed like barbed bolt from a bow.;kirkpatrick
1;18;1-3;There is in Hell a place called Rottenpockets, rock, all rock, its colour rusted iron, as is the wall that circles all around.;kirkpatrick
1;18;4-6;Dead in the centre of that poisoned plain a well yawns open – empty, broad and deep. Of that (when it’s ‘convenient’) I’ll have my say.;kirkpatrick
1;18;7-9;For now, between the well mouth and the clench of cliff, a circling belt goes round, its floor divided into ten deep trenches.;kirkpatrick
1;18;10-12;Compare: to guard the outer walls of castles, moats in concentric multiples are dug, and form the figure of a wheel around them.;kirkpatrick
1;18;13-15;That was the pattern that these trenches made. And where, from fortresses, pontoons run out to link each threshold to the other shore,;kirkpatrick
1;18;16-18;so, at the bottom of the precipice, radials ride over every bank and ditch till, at the pit, they’re stopped and then sucked in.;kirkpatrick
1;18;19-21;This was the place where – shaken from the spine of Geryon – we found ourselves. The poet took the left-hand fork. I followed in his track.;kirkpatrick
1;18;22-24;Then, to my right, I saw fresh suffering: new whips, new torments and new torturers, and Pocket One, with these, was all a-flutter.;kirkpatrick
1;18;25-27;Down in those depths, stark naked, there were sinners who came, on this side of a line, face on, and faster, in our direction, on the other.;kirkpatrick
1;18;28-30;The Romans, in the Jubilee, devised a way for pilgrims and pedestrians, in all their multitudes, to cross the Bridge;kirkpatrick
1;18;31-33;so that, on one side (making for Saint Peter’s), they faced the Castle and, conversely, took the other lane when heading for the Hill.;kirkpatrick
1;18;34-36;This way, that way, over the dismal rock, there were (I saw them!) horny demons lashing, lashing at the rear with vicious scourges.;kirkpatrick
1;18;37-39;"Ouch! Even at the first stroke they lifted their trotters; and none of them, for certain, stayed for second helpings – fewer still for thirds.";kirkpatrick
1;18;40-42;But then, as I was moving on, looks clashed, my own and one of theirs. I said straight off: ‘There’s one I’ve seen before. Once was enough.’;kirkpatrick
1;18;43-45;"To get him in my sights, I stopped my stride; and, pausing quietly along with me, my guide now let me turn a short way back.";kirkpatrick
1;18;46-48;The body beaten abased its gaze, as if it thought he really could hide. That didn’t work. ‘You there,’ I said, ‘Eyes-down! Bashful, are we?;kirkpatrick
1;18;49-51;Assuming that your profile’s not a lie, then you are Venedico Caccianemico. So what brings you to this killing pickle?’;kirkpatrick
1;18;52-54;And he to me: ‘I grudge you my reply. You and your bright words grind one out of me, and make me call the world that was to mind.;kirkpatrick
1;18;55-57;"Foul tittle-tattle got this right. It’s me; I fixed it. My sister Ghisolabella did let the marquis have his way with her.";kirkpatrick
1;18;58-60;Don’t think, though, I’m the only Bolognese who’s here in tears. The place is full of us. Between the rivers Sàvena and Reno,;kirkpatrick
1;18;61-63;far fewer tongues speak “yes” as “yeah” than here. And if you want to get this straight, recall what money means to Bolognese hearts.’;kirkpatrick
1;18;64-66;And, as he spoke, a devil now struck out: ‘Push off, you pimp,’ he said, and swung his lash. ‘There aren’t tarts here for you to turn to cash.’;kirkpatrick
1;18;67-69;I turned to join my escort once again, and walked with him a few steps further on, then reached an outcrop jutting from the bank.;kirkpatrick
1;18;70-72;We made our way quite easily up that, then, turning right along the splintered ridge, we left that bunch to endless circulation.;kirkpatrick
1;18;73-75;So now we came to where the vault gapes wide to let those beaten beings pass beneath. ‘Pause here,’ said Virgil, ‘and ensure some glimpse;kirkpatrick
1;18;76-78;of all these woebegones now marks your eye. They go in our direction. So, as yet, you’ve had no chance to look them in the face.’;kirkpatrick
1;18;79-81;We saw from that decrepit bridge the traces of a second crew. These came towards us. These, as well, were driven by whistling whips.;kirkpatrick
1;18;82-84;I did not prompt him, but my mentor said: ‘Look at that hero there, advancing now! He seems, for all his pain, to shed no tear.;kirkpatrick
1;18;85-87;How great an air of majesty he still retains! He is that Jason who, astute and strong, made Colchos grieve to lose its gold-fleeced ram.;kirkpatrick
1;18;88-90;Journeying on, he passed the isle of Lemnos, where cold and reckless women had, by then, delivered death to every living male.;kirkpatrick
1;18;91-93;Yet he, with hints and eloquence of phrase, beguiled the young Hypsipyle – a girl who had herself proved guileful to the rest.;kirkpatrick
1;18;94-96;Alone he left her there, alone, with child. That crime incurs for him this penalty which also stands as vengeance for Medea.;kirkpatrick
1;18;97-99;Along with him go all who turned such tricks. And that’s enough to know about this vale, or else of those who’re caught within its fangs.’;kirkpatrick
1;18;100-102;We’d come already to the point at which the tight path crosses with the second bank and makes a shoulder to another arch.;kirkpatrick
1;18;103-105;And now we heard, from Pocket Number Two, the groans and griping of another lot, the snuffling of their snouts, their slapping palms.;kirkpatrick
1;18;106-108;The banks were crusted with a slime and mould that rose up in porridgy exhalations and, scuffling, violated eye and nose.;kirkpatrick
1;18;109-111;The bottom of that pit goes down so deep we saw it only when we climbed the ridge and stood to see the rock rise straight above.;kirkpatrick
1;18;112-114;Reaching that point and looking down, we saw that all of them were plunged in diarrhoea flowing, it seemed, from human cubicles.;kirkpatrick
1;18;115-117;And while my eyes were searching deep within, I noticed one whose head was foul with shit. Had he the tonsure? It was hard to tell.;kirkpatrick
1;18;118-120;But he screamed out at me: ‘Why gawp like that, so hungry-eyed for me and not the other swill?’;kirkpatrick
1;18;121-123;‘Because,’ I said, ‘if I remember well, I’ve seen you once before, with drier coiffure. You are from Lucca. Alessio Interminei.;kirkpatrick
1;18;124-126;And that is why I’ve got my eye on you.’ He answered (battering his turnip top): ‘I’m sunk this deep because of flatteries – none were too sickly for my tongue to speak.’;kirkpatrick
1;18;127-129;When that was done, my leader now went on: ‘Just poke your nose a little further out. Your eyes may then be able to detect;kirkpatrick
1;18;130-132;a slut down there – filthy, with tangled hair, scratting herself with cacky fingernails, squatting at one time, upright at the next.;kirkpatrick
1;18;133-135;Thais! She’s there, the whore, the one who cooed to her hot panting swain (“Yeees! Good for you?”), “Angel, a miracle! My thanks indeed!”;kirkpatrick
1;18;136-136;Let that be all that here we need to view.’;kirkpatrick
1;19;1-3;You! Magic Simon, and your sorry school! Things that are God’s own – things that, truly, are the brides of goodness – lusting cruelly;kirkpatrick
1;19;4-6;after gold and silver, you turn them all to whores. The trumpet now (and rightly!) sounds for you. There you all are, well set in Pocket Three.;kirkpatrick
1;19;7-9;Onwards towards this yawning tomb, mounting the ridge, by now we’d reached its summit – the point that plumbs the middle of the ditch.;kirkpatrick
1;19;10-12;O wisdom in the height, how great the art that you display in Heaven, on earth and even in that evil world! How justly you deal power!;kirkpatrick
1;19;13-15;I saw how all the livid rock was drilled with holes – along its flanks, across its floor – all circular, and all of equal measure.;kirkpatrick
1;19;16-18;To me they seemed, in radius, no more nor less than fonts that, in my own beloved Saint John’s, allow the priest at baptisms a place to stand.;kirkpatrick
1;19;19-21;(Not long ago, I shattered one of those. Someone was drowning there. I got them out. This, sealed and sworn, is nothing but the truth.);kirkpatrick
1;19;22-24;Out of the mouth of every single hole there floated up a pair of sinner feet, legs to the ham on show, the rest concealed.;kirkpatrick
1;19;25-27;The soles of all these feet were set alight, and each pair wriggled at the joint so hard they’d easily have ripped a rope or lanyard.;kirkpatrick
1;19;28-30;As flames go flickering round some greasy thing and hover just above its outer rind, so these flames also, toe tip to heel end.;kirkpatrick
1;19;31-33;‘Who, sir,’ I said, ‘is that one there? That one who jerks in pain far greater than his confrères, sucked at by flames more fiercely vermilion.’;kirkpatrick
1;19;34-36;‘I’ll lift you down,’ he answered me, ‘if you insist. We’ll take that bank the easier. He’ll talk to you himself about his twists.’;kirkpatrick
1;19;37-39;‘Whatever pleases you,’ I said, ‘to me is good. Lord, you remain: I’ll not depart – you know – from what you will. You read my silent thoughts.’;kirkpatrick
1;19;40-42;So on we went to the fourth embankment. We turned around, descended on our left, arriving at that pitted, straitened floor.;kirkpatrick
1;19;43-45;My teacher, kindly, did not set me down – nor loose me from his hip hold – till we’d reached that fissure where (all tears) shanks shuddered.;kirkpatrick
1;19;46-48;‘Whatever you might be there, upside down, staked, you unhappy spirit, like a pole, if you,’ I said, ‘are able, then speak out.’;kirkpatrick
1;19;49-51;So there I stood like any friar who shrives the hired assassin – head down in the earth – who calls him back to put off stifling death.;kirkpatrick
1;19;52-54;And he yelled out: ‘Is that you standing there? Are you there, on your feet still, Boniface? The writings lied to me by quite some years.;kirkpatrick
1;19;55-57;Are you so sick of owning things already? Till now, you’ve hardly been afraid to cheat our lovely woman, tearing her to shreds.’;kirkpatrick
1;19;58-60;Well, I just stood there (you will know just how) simply not getting what I’d heard come out, feeling a fool, uncertain what to say.;kirkpatrick
1;19;61-63;Then Virgil entered: ‘Say this – and make speed: “No, that’s not me. I am not who you think.”’ And so I answered as he’d said I should.;kirkpatrick
1;19;64-66;At which – all feet – the spirit thrashed about, then, sighing loudly in a tearful voice: ‘So what is it you want of me?’ he said.;kirkpatrick
1;19;67-69;‘If you’re so keen to know who I might be, and ran all down that slope to find me out, you’d better know I wore the papal cope.;kirkpatrick
1;19;70-72;A true Orsini, son of Ursa Bear, I showed such greed in favouring her brats that – up there well in pocket – I’m in pocket here.;kirkpatrick
1;19;73-75;Below me, in great stacks beneath my head, packed tight in every cranny of the rock, are all my antecedents in the Simon line.;kirkpatrick
1;19;76-78;Down there I’ll sink, in that same way, when he arrives whom I supposed that you might be, and uttered, therefore, my abrupt inquiry.;kirkpatrick
1;19;79-81;But I already – feet up on the grill, tossed upside down – have passed more time than Boniface yet will, stuck here with red hot toes.;kirkpatrick
1;19;82-84;For after him from westwards there’ll appear that lawless shepherd, uglier in deed, who then, for both of us, will form a lid.;kirkpatrick
1;19;85-87;He shall be known as a “Jason-Once-Again”. We read in Maccabees: “Priest Bribes a King.” This other will score well with one French prince.’;kirkpatrick
1;19;88-90;I may have been plain mad. I do not know. But now, in measured verse, I sang these words: ‘Tell me, I pray: what riches did Our Lord;kirkpatrick
1;19;91-93;demand, as first installment, from Saint Peter before He placed the keys in his command? He asked (be sure) no more than: “Come behind me.”;kirkpatrick
1;19;94-96;Nor did Saint Peter, or the rest of them, receive from Matthias a gold or silver piece, allotting him the place that Judas lost.;kirkpatrick
1;19;97-99;So you stay put. You merit punishment. But keep your eye on that ill-gotten coin that made you bold with Charles the Angevin.;kirkpatrick
1;19;100-102;And, were I not forbidden, as I am, by reverence for those keys, supreme and holy, that you hung on to in the happy life,;kirkpatrick
1;19;103-105;I now would bring still weightier words to bear. You and your greed bring misery to the world, trampling the good and raising up the wicked.;kirkpatrick
1;19;106-108;Saint John took heed of shepherds such as you. He saw revealed that She-above-the-Waves, whoring it up with Rulers of the earth,;kirkpatrick
1;19;109-111;she who in truth was born with seven heads and fed herself, in truth, from ten pure horns, as long as she in virtue pleased her man.;kirkpatrick
1;19;112-114;Silver and gold you have made your god. And what’s the odds – you and some idol-worshipper? He prays to one, you to a gilded hundred.;kirkpatrick
1;19;115-117;What harm you mothered, Emperor Constantine! Not your conversion but the dowry he – that first rich Papa – thus obtained from you!’;kirkpatrick
1;19;118-120;And all the time I chanted out these notes, he, in his wrath or bitten by remorse, flapped, with great force, the flat of both his feet.;kirkpatrick
1;19;121-123;My leader, I believe, was very pleased. In listening to these sounding words of truth, he stood there satisfied, his lips compressed.;kirkpatrick
1;19;124-126;So, too, he took me up in his embrace. Then, bodily, he clasped me to his breast and climbed again the path where he’d come down.;kirkpatrick
1;19;127-129;Nor did he tire of holding me so tight. He bore me to the summit of that arch spanning the banks of Pockets Four and Five.;kirkpatrick
1;19;130-132;And there he gently put his burden down, gently on rocks so craggy and so steep they might have seemed to goats too hard to cross.;kirkpatrick
1;19;133-133;From there, another valley was disclosed.;kirkpatrick
1;20;1-3;I now must turn a strange new pain to verse and give some substance to this twentieth chant that deals with sunken souls.;kirkpatrick
1;20;4-6;Already I had set myself to peer intently on those now-discovered depths, washed as they were with agonizing tears.;kirkpatrick
1;20;7-9;I saw there people circling round that trench. And on they came in silence, weeping still – as slow in pace as litanies on earth.;kirkpatrick
1;20;10-12;Then, as my gaze sank lower down these forms, each was revealed (the wonder of it all!) twisted around between the chin and thorax.;kirkpatrick
1;20;13-15;The face of each looked down towards its coccyx. And each, deprived of vision to the front, came, as it must, reversed along its way.;kirkpatrick
1;20;16-18;Seized by some paralytic fit, others, perhaps, have been so turned awry. But I – not having seen, myself – don’t credit it.;kirkpatrick
1;20;19-21;That God may grant you, as you read, the fruit that you deserve in reading, think, yourselves: could I have kept my own face dry, to see,;kirkpatrick
1;20;22-24;close by, that image of our human self so wrenched from true that teardrops from the eyes ran down to rinse them where the buttocks cleave?;kirkpatrick
1;20;25-27;Of this, be sure: that, leaning on a spur of that unyielding cliff, I wept. ‘Are you,’ my escort said, ‘like them, an idiot still?;kirkpatrick
1;20;28-30;Here pity lives where pity’s truth is dead. Who is more impious, more scarred with sin than one who pleads compassion at God’s throne?;kirkpatrick
1;20;31-33;"Lift up your head! Stand straight. See, that one there? Under his chariot wheels, the earth yawned wide; and Thebes – all eyes – yelled:";kirkpatrick
1;20;34-36;“Where, Amphiaraus, headlong away? Why leave us in this strife?” Into the ceaseless void he fell, until he came where Minos stands, who seizes all.;kirkpatrick
1;20;37-39;He’s formed his chest – amazingly – from shoulder. As once he wished to see too far ahead, his tread is backward, and he stares to rear.;kirkpatrick
1;20;40-42;See there Tiresias! Male-to-female switch. His looks, mutating, were entirely changed, his members altering till each was each.;kirkpatrick
1;20;43-45;And then, to win once more his virile plumes, he needs must strike a second time, and shake again at coupling snakes his witch’s wand.;kirkpatrick
1;20;46-48;Then, spine to gut, the prophet Arruns comes. High in the Lunigiana hills – over Carrara homesteads, so hard-hoed by serfs –;kirkpatrick
1;20;49-51;he found a grotto in the marble cliffs and took this for his dwelling place. Nothing, from there, cuts off the view of sea or star.;kirkpatrick
1;20;52-54;And then there’s one whose breasts you cannot see (since these are mantled by her flowing strands) who shows on that side all her shaggy fleece.;kirkpatrick
1;20;55-57;She, once, was Manto, scouring many lands, until she reached and settled at my birthplace. And so – to please me – listen for a while.;kirkpatrick
1;20;58-60;Her father, having left this life – and Thebes, the place of Bacchus, being now in thrall – for years she travelled, searching through this world.;kirkpatrick
1;20;61-63;Above, in lovely Italy, there lies a lake (in Latin: Benacus) beneath those Alps that lock out Germany beyond the high Tyrol.;kirkpatrick
1;20;64-66;From waters gathered in that standing pool a thousand springs, I think, or more, refresh the lands between those peaks, Camonica and Garda.;kirkpatrick
1;20;67-69;There is a place, the central point of these, where pastors – if they choose to sail from Brescia, from Verona and from Trent – have power to bless.;kirkpatrick
1;20;70-72;Here that brave citadel Peschiera sits, built where the shoreline sinks to reach a low, boldly outfacing Bergamese and Brescians.;kirkpatrick
1;20;73-75;Cascading from the lap of Benacus, waters, unstoppably, must run down here. Through lush green meadows these all form a stream.;kirkpatrick
1;20;76-78;And this, when it begins to run, is known by name as Mincio, not Benacus. (It meets the river Po around Govérnolo.);kirkpatrick
1;20;79-81;Moving, the Mincio at once dips down, then, broadening in the plain, it forms a marsh – and this in summer can be foul and brackish.;kirkpatrick
1;20;82-84;Manto, that bitter virgin, passing by, saw, in the centre of that great morass, a place unploughed and bare of population.;kirkpatrick
1;20;85-87;There, fleeing still from human fellowship, she settled with her vassals, plied her arts, in this place lived, here left her empty corpse.;kirkpatrick
1;20;88-90;Then other peoples came who had, so long, been scattered all about. Because the marsh surrounded it, the site was safe and strong.;kirkpatrick
1;20;91-93;They raised their city over those dead bones. They called it Mantua (no magic charm!), since Manto first had made the place her own.;kirkpatrick
1;20;94-96;Those living there were once more numerous, before the idiotic Casalodi was so taken in by Pinamonte’s trick.;kirkpatrick
1;20;97-99;So, if in other stories you should hear some tale of how my city came to be, don’t let the truth, I urge, be mocked by lies.’;kirkpatrick
1;20;100-102;‘Sir,’ I replied, ‘to me your words are sure, and capture so entirely what I think, that differing versions are as burned-out coal.;kirkpatrick
1;20;103-105;But let me know some more of this parade, that is, if any here still merit note. My mind is waiting only for that word.’;kirkpatrick
1;20;106-108;And so he said: ‘The one who there fans wide his beard from cheek to shadowed shoulderblade, was – in those years when Greece was void of men,;kirkpatrick
1;20;109-111;when, even in the cradle, boys were few – an augur. He, with Calchas, cast the hour at which to cut the anchor rope in Aulis.;kirkpatrick
1;20;112-114;By name Eurypylus, there is some verse in my great tragedy that sings of him. But you’ll know where. You know the whole thing through.;kirkpatrick
1;20;115-117;And then we meet, so withered in his flanks, a certain Scotsman, Michael. In the spheres of fraud and magic, he was full of pranks.;kirkpatrick
1;20;118-120;There’s Guido Bonatti. Look! Asdente, too! The cobbler must be wishing now he’d stuck to thread and leathers. Too late to repent.;kirkpatrick
1;20;121-123;Then see those hags? They, one and all, forsook for witchcraft distaff, needle, pin and spool. They cast their spells with weeds and juju dolls.;kirkpatrick
1;20;124-126;But come, now come. The zone where hemispheres both meet by now is gripped (and, under Seville, waves are touched) by Cain, his bush and thorns.;kirkpatrick
1;20;127-129;And yestere’en the rounding moon was full. You must remember this. It shone while you, unharmed, were deep within that first dark wood.’;kirkpatrick
1;20;130-130;And so he chatted on and we fared forwards.;kirkpatrick
1;21;1-3;So on we went from bridge to bridge, speaking of things that I shan’t, in my comedy, commit to song. We gained the brow. Once there,;kirkpatrick
1;21;4-6;we paused and, down in Rottenpockets, saw another fissure still, more empty tears. I saw it all – a marvel of mere dark.;kirkpatrick
1;21;7-9;Compare: Venetians in their Arsenal, in winter when their ships cannot set sail, brew up a viscous pitch which they then smear;kirkpatrick
1;21;10-12;on ailing boards, or else lay down new hulls. Others will plug the ribs of hulks that have, by now, made many a long-haul trip.;kirkpatrick
1;21;13-15;Some hammer at the prow, some at the poop, some whittle oars, where others plait the rig. Some mend the mainsail, others patch the jib.;kirkpatrick
1;21;16-18;So here – though more by art of God than fire – a dense black gunge was brought to boiling point, and splashed on all the banks in sticky smears.;kirkpatrick
1;21;19-21;I saw this stuff but nothing else within but bubbles as the boiling bubbled on, swelling to roundness, glue-ily sinking in.;kirkpatrick
1;21;22-24;In mesmerized amazement I just gazed. But then, ‘Look out! Look out!’ my leader cried, then dragged me, where I’d stood, towards his side.;kirkpatrick
1;21;25-27;And there I turned as one who may well pause – all swagger, in his sudden panic, gone – to peep at what he really ought to flee,;kirkpatrick
1;21;28-30;yet, glimpsing this, does not delay his parting. I saw there, right behind us, this black demon running the ridge around in our direction.;kirkpatrick
1;21;31-33;Eek! How ferocious all his features looked. How viciously his every move seemed etched, wings wide apart, so lithe and light of foot.;kirkpatrick
1;21;34-36;The hunch blades of his shoulders, keen and proud, bore up the haunches of some criminal, his hook fixed firm in tendons at each heel.;kirkpatrick
1;21;37-39;Mounting our bridge, demonically he barked: ‘Get this, Rotklors! A boss man from Lucca! You lot can dunk him. I’ll get back for more.;kirkpatrick
1;21;40-42;I’ve got it stuffed, Saint Zita’s place, with this sort. They’re at it there, the lot. (Oh! Not Bonturo!) Cash on the nail, and “no” becomes “for sure”.’;kirkpatrick
1;21;43-45;Dumping his load, he then dashed down and crossed the flinty slope. No mad bullmastiff ever was loosed so fast to catch a thief.;kirkpatrick
1;21;46-48;The sinner dived, but then turned, writhing up. At which the demons, dossing by that bridge, yelled: ‘No place, black face, here for black-faced gods.;kirkpatrick
1;21;49-51;You can’t swim here like bathers in the Serchio. If you don’t want to know what hooks can do, then just don’t poke your nose above that tar.’;kirkpatrick
1;21;52-54;They sank in him a hundred barbs or more. ‘Down here,’ they sang, ‘you’ll tango in the dark! Get under cover! Pull what scams you can!’;kirkpatrick
1;21;55-57;Chefs do the same. They get their kitchen boys to fork the centre of a simmering pot, so chunks of meat do not float up too high.;kirkpatrick
1;21;58-60;Here, too. ‘Seem not to be here,’ Sir now said. ‘Just hunker down behind a spur of rock. It may still offer you some place to hide.;kirkpatrick
1;21;61-63;Yet have no fear. Oppose me as they may, my strategy – I know what’s what – is clear. I’ve been involved in rucks like this before.’;kirkpatrick
1;21;64-66;So now, beyond the bridge head, on he went, and needed, when he neared Embankment Six, the steadiest front that he could summon up.;kirkpatrick
1;21;67-69;With all the fury and tempestuous rage of dog packs rushing on some poor old tramp – who freezes there and pleads from where he’d reached –;kirkpatrick
1;21;70-72;so now those demons underneath the arch stormed out at him and brandished all their hooks. But he cried out: ‘Don’t even think of it.;kirkpatrick
1;21;73-75;Before you set on me with curving prongs, let one of you who’ll hear me out draw near, and then discuss if hooking me is right or wrong.’;kirkpatrick
1;21;76-78;So, ‘Go on, Rottentail,’ they shrieked. ‘That’s you!’ And he advanced (the others kept their ground and muttered: ‘What will he get out of it?’);kirkpatrick
1;21;79-81;‘Do you imagine, Rottentail,’ my teacher said, ‘who’ve seen me come already once, immune to all your tricks, that I am here without;kirkpatrick
1;21;82-84;the favouring aid of fate or will divine? Let us pass on. For Heaven wills that I should guide another on the savage way.’;kirkpatrick
1;21;85-87;His arrogance at this took such a fall he let his hook slip, dangling, to his heels. ‘OK,’ he told the others, ‘let’s not cut him.’;kirkpatrick
1;21;88-90;And now my leader turned and said: ‘O thou who sittest there, squatting by that splintered bridge, return to me with confidence renewed.’;kirkpatrick
1;21;91-93;So shift I did, and reached him speedily. At which the demons all came pressing forwards – so I could not be sure they’d keep their word.;kirkpatrick
1;21;94-96;In this way, at Caprona once I saw the infantry come edging out, despite safe conduct, chary of the hordes around.;kirkpatrick
1;21;97-99;Huddled against my leader’s side, pressed hard along him, head to toe, I could not wrench my eyes from them. Their looks did not look good.;kirkpatrick
1;21;100-102;They cocked their barbs. Then one spoke out: ‘Want me to touch him on his fat backside?’ And they replied: ‘Yeah, get him in the notch.’;kirkpatrick
1;21;103-105;But then that devil who was still in speech with my great leader swung around at speed, and said: ‘Just cool it, cool it, Tangletop!’;kirkpatrick
1;21;106-108;‘Further along this crag,’ he now declared, ‘you just can’t go. Bridge Six is broken down. It lies in ruins on the valley floor.;kirkpatrick
1;21;109-111;But if you’d care to schlepp still further on, then do so round this arching cliff. Nearby, another outcrop makes a path for you.;kirkpatrick
1;21;112-114;Just yesterday (five hours ahead of now), a thousand years, two centuries and sixty-six from when the path was cut had then elapsed.;kirkpatrick
1;21;115-117;I’ll send in that direction some of mine, to watch for any sinner scenting air. You go with them. They won’t dare pull a stunt.’;kirkpatrick
1;21;118-120;‘So, forward, Crackice! Forward, Flash Ali!’ so he began: ‘And Baddog! You as well. And you, old Twirlitufts, can lead the squad.;kirkpatrick
1;21;121-123;Loveslot as well. And you, too, Dragonrunt, Bigpig with tusks, and also Skratcherker, Flutterby! For’ard! And you there, mad Glogob!;kirkpatrick
1;21;124-126;Search all around this pan of boiling lime: until you reach the spur that arcs, unbroken, over these dens, these two will go unharmed.’;kirkpatrick
1;21;127-129;‘Sir, sir,’ I said, ‘what’s this I see! Please, sir, if you know how and where, let’s go alone. Myself, I didn’t ask for this at all.;kirkpatrick
1;21;130-132;Your eyes are usually so very keen. Can you not see? Just look! They grind their teeth. Their frowns are warnings of what harm they mean.’;kirkpatrick
1;21;133-135;His answer was: ‘I wouldn’t have you frightened. Let them scowl so, and grind as they may choose. They mean it for the souls in this sad stew.’;kirkpatrick
1;21;136-138;About-face, leftwards on the rocky pass, each poked a tongue, teeth clenched, towards their lord, and he – to give the order now, ‘Quick march!’ –;kirkpatrick
1;21;139-139;in answer made a trumpet of his arse.;kirkpatrick
1;22;1-3;I, in my time, have seen brave knights strike camp, parade their power, launch an attack, and then, at times, to save their skins, desert the field.;kirkpatrick
1;22;4-6;Yes, you, Aretines, I have seen our cavalry charge through your heartland. Skirmishes I’ve seen, cut-and-thrust tournaments and running duels,;kirkpatrick
1;22;7-9;all to the sound of horns (at times) or bells, to beating drums or signals flashed from ramparts, devices of our own and more exotic signs.;kirkpatrick
1;22;10-12;Yet never to so weird a pipe or whistle have I, till now, seen foot or horse fall in, nor ship set sail to signs like that, from land or star.;kirkpatrick
1;22;13-15;So, on we went, five friends on either side. What fearsome company! Well, that’s the way it is: hobnob in church with saints, in pubs with sots.;kirkpatrick
1;22;16-18;The tar pit called for all my concentration to note each facet of this rotten hole, and also of the persons burning there.;kirkpatrick
1;22;19-21;As schools of dolphin when they arch their spines provide a signal to the mariner, to say the ship should soon be steered back home,;kirkpatrick
1;22;22-24;so too from time to time, to ease their pain, a sinner gave his back some air, then quick as any lightning flash would hide again.;kirkpatrick
1;22;25-27;Likewise, in ditches at the water’s edge, bullfrogs will stand, their snouts alone on show, their feet concealed, with all their bulk below.;kirkpatrick
1;22;28-30;In this same way, these sinners lolled around. But then, whenever Twirlitufts came past, they swiftly dived beneath the bubbling crust.;kirkpatrick
1;22;31-33;I saw – at this, my heart still skips a beat – that one (as happens when a frog school springs, but one stays dallying) was left behind.;kirkpatrick
1;22;34-36;And Skratcherker – as being nearest to him – enmeshed his hook among those tar-caked locks and yanked him out like any floppy otter.;kirkpatrick
1;22;37-39;I knew them all by name, the lot of them. I’d noted each when they were first enrolled, and then, between them, heard them call out names.;kirkpatrick
1;22;40-42;‘Get in there, Glogob! Get him with your hook!’ (So, in damned unison, the chorus shrieked.) ‘And tear the leather off his ugly rump!’;kirkpatrick
1;22;43-45;I turned, and to my master said: ‘Find out, if you can manage it: who is that so-and-so who’s fallen foul of these antagonists?’;kirkpatrick
1;22;46-48;My leader went, and stood beside him there, wanting to know the place where he was born. He answered: ‘I’m a native of Navarre.;kirkpatrick
1;22;49-51;My mother, having borne me to a lout, who brought himself and all he had to ruin, engaged me to the service of a nobleman.;kirkpatrick
1;22;52-54;And then I joined King Thibaut’s retinue, to practise arts of chartered bribery. For which I pay my dues in this great heat.’;kirkpatrick
1;22;55-57;Then Bigpig, with his boar-like jowls – a tusk stuck out from both his cheeks – supplied a sip of how well one of these could rake and rip.;kirkpatrick
1;22;58-60;The mouse had got among the bad cats now. But Twirlitufts enclosed him in his arms. ‘Stay over there!’ he said. ‘I’ll keep him pinned.’;kirkpatrick
1;22;61-63;He tilted up his face towards my guide: ‘Go on, then. Ask him, if you want still more. But quick,’ he said, ‘before they do him in.’;kirkpatrick
1;22;64-66;‘So tell me, then,’ my master now went on, ‘among the criminals beneath the tar, are any – can you tell? – Italian?’;kirkpatrick
1;22;67-69;‘Just now,’ he answered me, ‘I left a man from there. If only I were with him still beneath the lid, I wouldn’t need to dread these hooks and claws.’;kirkpatrick
1;22;70-72;‘We’ve taken quite enough of this!’ So said the Loveslot. Skewering an arm, he sliced a muscle out in one long hookful.;kirkpatrick
1;22;73-75;Then Dragonrunt must also have a go. He ogled the ham. But their decurion swung round and gave them all a filthy frown.;kirkpatrick
1;22;76-78;Then, just a little, they all settled down. The sinner lay there, wondering at his wound. My lord without delay now turned and asked:;kirkpatrick
1;22;79-81;‘Who was the one from whom, you say, you took, ill-fatedly, your leave to reach this shore?’ ‘Brother – as was – Gomita!’ he replied.;kirkpatrick
1;22;82-84;‘Sard from Gallura, vessel of deceit! Palming (well-greased) his sire’s worst enemies, he treated all so well, each sang his praise.;kirkpatrick
1;22;85-87;He took their cash, then let them off the hook. In this – as he’ll admit – and everything a total crook. Not small time, though. The King!;kirkpatrick
1;22;88-90;Don Michael Zanche, from the Logudor, still hangs around with him. Their tongues don’t tire of banging on about “Sardin-i-ah”.;kirkpatrick
1;22;91-93;Ow! Look at how that demon grinds his teeth. I could tell more but (oh! I’m terrified!) he means to come and give my scabs a scrub!’;kirkpatrick
1;22;94-96;The high commander swung on Flutterby, whose moon eyes popped in eagerness to pounce. ‘Butt out!’ he hissed. ‘You vulture! Over there!’;kirkpatrick
1;22;97-99;Witless with fear, he started once again: ‘If you would witness or hold audience with Lombards or Tuscans, I can make them come.;kirkpatrick
1;22;100-102;But let these Rotklors all stand well aside – and no one need be frightened they’ll attack – while I, just sitting on this self-same spot,;kirkpatrick
1;22;103-105;will whistle. Now I’m here alone. Presto! And now we’re seven! That’s our usual trick when any from below gets out of it.’;kirkpatrick
1;22;106-108;Hearing this blag, old Baddog twitched his snout, then shook his head and snarled: ‘The little demon! He means to take a dive and get back in.’;kirkpatrick
1;22;109-111;That sinner up his sleeve had snares galore. ‘O yeah! That’s me,’ he said. ‘A demon! Sure! Really? You think I’d bring my gang more grief?’;kirkpatrick
1;22;112-114;Flash Ali, at these words, could not hold back. Despite what his companions thought, ‘Go on,’ he said. ‘Slope off. I’ll not come galloping.;kirkpatrick
1;22;115-117;I will, though, stretch my wings across the pitch. Let’s leave the ridge. Let’s make the slope our screen. And then we’ll see if you can get off clean.’;kirkpatrick
1;22;118-120;O you there, as you read! Get this! Olympics! They all then turned to face the other bank, even the one who first was most reluctant.;kirkpatrick
1;22;121-123;The Navarrese chose his moment well. Feet firmly planted, in a single flash, he’d leapt and gone, scot-free of their intent.;kirkpatrick
1;22;124-126;At this, the lot of them were pierced by guilt. Yet, undeterred, the devil most at fault drove onwards. ‘Now you’re for it!’ he yelled out.;kirkpatrick
1;22;127-129;To no avail. No wing could overhaul the speed of fear. The sinner plunged. Square on, the demon baulked and then shot up again.;kirkpatrick
1;22;130-132;So, too, a rapid duck dives down, glimpsing a falcon closing in. The duck’s foe then returns aloft, bitter in thwarted pique.;kirkpatrick
1;22;133-135;Crackice, still seething at the doublecross, zoomed ever onwards in his yen to see the sinner free – then mix it with Flash Ali.;kirkpatrick
1;22;136-138;So, since the barrator had long since gone, he turned his talons on his own best mate. Above the ditch he locked him in his prongs.;kirkpatrick
1;22;139-141;The other, though, a right old sparrowhawk, returned the hook. And so the two of them, as one, went tumbling to the boiling pond.;kirkpatrick
1;22;142-144;The heat that instant made them come unhitched. But, even so, they couldn’t raise a thing, so tightly glued together were their wings.;kirkpatrick
1;22;145-147;Then Twirlitufts, condoling with his kin, sent four of them towards the inner rim, with all their grappling tackle, at top speed.;kirkpatrick
1;22;148-150;This side and that they went to take their posts, and bent their hooks towards those two, stuck fast. By now they both were crisped within the batter.;kirkpatrick
1;22;151-151;With that entanglement, we left the matter.;kirkpatrick
1;23;1-3;Silent, alone with no one now beside us, we went our way – the one behind, the other leading on – walking as meek Franciscans do.;kirkpatrick
1;23;4-6;My mind turned (thinking of that scuffle still) to Aesop and his fables, most of all the one about the frog and rat and hawk.;kirkpatrick
1;23;7-9;For ‘now’ and ‘noo’ are hardly more alike than this fine mess to that – if parallels are rightly drawn between the start and finish.;kirkpatrick
1;23;10-12;But thoughts pop up and then lead on to more. So from this first a further set was born, which now redoubled all my earlier fears.;kirkpatrick
1;23;13-15;‘Because of us,’ the sequence ran, ‘that lot have been so injured, put on, tricked and scorned, they cannot fail, I think, to be upset.;kirkpatrick
1;23;16-18;Suppose their bile gets tangled now with anger, then surely they’ll come after us and snarl more viciously than dogs that snout a hare.’;kirkpatrick
1;23;19-21;I felt already that my every curl was bristling, on its end. So, gazing back, stock still, I said: ‘If you, sir, do not hide;kirkpatrick
1;23;22-24;yourself this second, me as well… I dread the Rotklors gang. They’re not now far behind. I hear them now, imagine it, quite clear.’;kirkpatrick
1;23;25-27;‘If I,’ he said, ‘were leaded mirror glass, I could not make your outer image mine more swiftly than I grasp your inward stress.;kirkpatrick
1;23;28-30;Your thoughts just now came in upon my own, in bearing similar, and look as well. These, all together, formed a single plan.;kirkpatrick
1;23;31-33;Suppose that, on the right, the incline’s such that we can reach the pocket there beyond, we shall elude the hunt we now imagine.’;kirkpatrick
1;23;34-36;No sooner had he offered up this thought than, coming after us, I saw them, wings stretched wide, now closer, meaning to get us.;kirkpatrick
1;23;37-39;My leader in an instant caught me up. A mother, likewise, wakened by some noise, who sees the flames – and sees them burning closer –;kirkpatrick
1;23;40-42;will snatch her son and flee and will not pause, caring less keenly for herself than him, to pull her shift or undershirt around her.;kirkpatrick
1;23;43-45;Down from the collar of that circling rock, backwards he launched himself, and met the slope that forms a bung against the other trench.;kirkpatrick
1;23;46-48;No mill race ever ran through any sluice at such velocity, or streamed to meet the scoops that drive, on land, the grinding stone,;kirkpatrick
1;23;49-51;as now my master slithered down that verge, bearing me with him, bound upon his breast, as though I were his son and no mere friend.;kirkpatrick
1;23;52-54;And hardly had his feet touched down to meet the pocket floor than those were at the summit, over us. We need have had no worries.;kirkpatrick
1;23;55-57;For that exalted providence that chose such ministers to guard Ditch Five also deprived them of the power to ever leave.;kirkpatrick
1;23;58-60;We found, down there, a people painted bright. Their tread, as round they went, was very slow, weeping, worn down and seemingly defeated.;kirkpatrick
1;23;61-63;They all wore robes with hoods hung low, that hid their eyes, tailored – in cut – to match those worn by monks who thrive in Benedictine Cluny.;kirkpatrick
1;23;64-66;So gilded outwardly, they dazed the eye. Within, these robes were all of lead – so heavy those capes that melt in torture would have seemed mere straw.;kirkpatrick
1;23;67-69;What labour to eternity to wear such dress! We took once more the leftward path along with them, intent on their distress and tears.;kirkpatrick
1;23;70-72;Because, though, of the labouring weight they bore, these weary folk came on so slow that we, at every hip swing, joined new company.;kirkpatrick
1;23;73-75;‘Do all you can’ – I put this to my guide – ‘to find here someone known by name or deed. As we move onward, scan around to see.’;kirkpatrick
1;23;76-78;Then one who’d recognized my Tuscan words from close behind yelled out: ‘You! Racing there through all this murky air, just ease your stride.;kirkpatrick
1;23;79-81;You’ll get, perhaps, from me what you desire.’ At this my leader turned. And, ‘Wait,’ he said, ‘then follow forwards at the pace he sets.’;kirkpatrick
1;23;82-84;I stopped and saw there two who, from their look, (though hampered by their load and narrow footings) in mind were speeding on to reach my side.;kirkpatrick
1;23;85-87;At last, they caught me up. With eyes a-squint, they gazed at me in wonder, spoke no word, till muttering they turned and, each to each:;kirkpatrick
1;23;88-90;‘This one, it seems – Just see his throat! It flicks! – is still alive. If dead, why favoured so, to go uncovered by a weighty cloak?’;kirkpatrick
1;23;91-93;And then to me direct they said: ‘Tuscan, you’ve reached the college of the hypocrites. Do not disdain to say who you might be.’;kirkpatrick
1;23;94-96;‘Born,’ I replied, ‘by the lovely Arno, grown in the city that adorns its banks, I still am in the limbs I’ve always worn.;kirkpatrick
1;23;97-99;But who are you, in whom, as I can see, great pain distils such tears upon your cheeks? What punishment strikes out these sparks from you?’;kirkpatrick
1;23;100-102;And one replied to me: ‘These orange robes are thick with such a quantity of lead, the weight of them would make a balance creak.;kirkpatrick
1;23;103-105;We’re good-time friars, Bolognese both. Our names? I’m Catalano. Loderingo’s there, captured together in that town of yours –;kirkpatrick
1;23;106-108;although, by custom, there is one alone whose mandate is to keep the peace. Our doings still appear around the Watch, for such we were.’;kirkpatrick
1;23;109-111;I then began: ‘O brothers! All the harm that you…’ but said no more. Straight to my sight, there sped one crucified. Three staves fixed him to earth.;kirkpatrick
1;23;112-114;And he, on seeing me, writhed all around and fluffed his beard up with the sighs he heaved. Then brother Catalan, who saw all this,;kirkpatrick
1;23;115-117;revealed to me: ‘This figure, staked, whom you so wonder at, advised the Pharisees that one man suffer for the sake of all.;kirkpatrick
1;23;118-120;Across the road, stretched naked, as you see, he first must feel, whoever passes by, the toiling weight of those who come this way.;kirkpatrick
1;23;121-123;Here too lies Annas – father of his wife – racked in this ditch with others of that house that proved an evil seed bed for the Jews.’;kirkpatrick
1;23;124-126;Virgil, I saw, just stood there marvelling, bending above that figure on the cross, eternally in ignominious exile.;kirkpatrick
1;23;127-129;But then, towards the friar he voiced: ‘Please say (though not to trouble you), if you’re allowed, is there some outlet lying to the right;kirkpatrick
1;23;130-132;through which the two of us can make our way without the need to call black angels here, who might come down to further our departure?’;kirkpatrick
1;23;133-135;‘Far sooner than you hope,’ the answer was, ‘we’ll near a rock that, jutting from the Ring, vaults over all these savage valley floors –;kirkpatrick
1;23;136-138;except it’s broken here and forms no covering. You can, though, clamber up the ruined side. The slope is gentle and the base piled high.’;kirkpatrick
1;23;139-141;My leader stood a moment, head hung down. And then he said: ‘He gave a false account, that hooker-up of sinners over there.’;kirkpatrick
1;23;142-144;‘I, in Bologna,’ so the friar said, ‘have heard a good few stories told of devil vice, not least “Old Nick’s a liar – falsehood’s dad”.’;kirkpatrick
1;23;145-147;At this, with lengthened pace, my lord strode off, clear signs of anger flitting on his face. And so I left these beings with their loads;kirkpatrick
1;23;148-148;to follow in the prints of his dear feet.;kirkpatrick
1;24;1-3;In that still baby-boyish time of year, when sunlight chills its curls beneath Aquarius, when nights grow shorter equalling the day,;kirkpatrick
1;24;4-6;and hoar frost writes fair copies on the ground to mimic in design its snowy sister (its pen, though, not chill-tempered to endure),;kirkpatrick
1;24;7-9;the peasant in this season, when supplies run short, rolls from his bed, looks out and sees the fields are glistening white, so slaps his thigh,;kirkpatrick
1;24;10-12;goes in, then grumbles up and down, as though (poor sod) he couldn’t find a thing to do, till, out once more, he fills his wicker trug,;kirkpatrick
1;24;13-15;with hope, at least. No time at all! The features of the world transform. He grabs his goad. Outdoors, he prods his lambs to open pasture.;kirkpatrick
1;24;16-18;In some such way, I too was first dismayed to see distress so written on my leader’s brow. But he, as quickly, plastered up the hurt.;kirkpatrick
1;24;19-21;And so, arriving at the ruined bridge, my leader turned that sour-sweet look on me that first he’d shown me at the mountain foot.;kirkpatrick
1;24;22-24;He spread his arms, then, having in his thought surveyed the landslip, and (a man of sense) assessed it well, he took me in his grip.;kirkpatrick
1;24;25-27;Then, always with adjustments in his moves (so that, it seemed, he foresaw everything), in hauling me towards the pinnacle;kirkpatrick
1;24;28-30;of one moraine, he’d see a spur beyond and say: ‘Next, take your hold on that niche there. But test it first to see how well it bears.’;kirkpatrick
1;24;31-33;This was no route for someone warmly dressed. Even for us – he, weightless, shoving me – we hardly could progress from ledge to ledge.;kirkpatrick
1;24;34-36;Had not the gradient been less severe than that which faced it on the other side, I’d have been beat. I cannot speak for him.;kirkpatrick
1;24;37-39;But Rottenpockets slopes towards the flap that opens on the lowest sump of all, and so, in contour, every ditch is shaped;kirkpatrick
1;24;40-42;with one rim proud, the other dipping down. So, in the end, we came upon the point where one last building block had sheared away.;kirkpatrick
1;24;43-45;My lungs by now had so been milked of breath that, come so far, I couldn’t make it further. I flopped, in fact, when we arrived, just there.;kirkpatrick
1;24;46-48;‘Now you must needs,’ my teacher said, ‘shake off your wonted indolence. No fame is won beneath the quilt or sunk in feather cushions.;kirkpatrick
1;24;49-51;Whoever, fameless, wastes his life away, leaves of himself no greater mark on earth than smoke in air or froth upon the wave.;kirkpatrick
1;24;52-54;So upwards! On! And vanquish laboured breath! In any battle mind-power will prevail, unless the weight of body loads it down.;kirkpatrick
1;24;55-57;There’s yet a longer ladder you must scale. You can’t just turn and leave all these behind. You understand? Well, make my words avail.’;kirkpatrick
1;24;58-60;So up I got, pretending to more puff than, really, I could feel I’d got within. ‘Let’s go,’ I answered, ‘I’m all strength and dash.’;kirkpatrick
1;24;61-63;Upwards we made our way, along the cliff – poor, narrow-going where the rocks jut out, far steeper than the slope had been before.;kirkpatrick
1;24;64-66;Talking (to seem less feeble) on I went, when, issuing from the ditch beyond, there came a voice – though one unfit for human words.;kirkpatrick
1;24;67-69;I made no sense of it. But now I neared the arch that forms a span across that pocket. The speaker seemed much moved by raging ire.;kirkpatrick
1;24;70-72;Downwards I bent. But in such dark as that, no eye alive could penetrate the depths. But, ‘Sir,’ I said, ‘make for the other edge,;kirkpatrick
1;24;73-75;and let us then descend the pocket wall. From here I hear but do not understand. So, too, I see, yet focus not at all.’;kirkpatrick
1;24;76-78;‘I offer you,’ he said to me, ‘no answer save “just do it”. Noble demands, by right, deserve the consequence of silent deeds.’;kirkpatrick
1;24;79-81;So where the bridgehead meets Embankment Eight we then went down, pursuing our descent, so all that pocket was displayed to me.;kirkpatrick
1;24;82-84;And there I came to see a dreadful brood of writhing reptiles of such diverse kinds the memory drains the very blood from me.;kirkpatrick
1;24;85-87;Let Libya boast – for all her sand – no more! Engender as she may chelydri, pharae, chenchres and amphisbaenae, jaculi,;kirkpatrick
1;24;88-90;never – and, yes, add Ethiopia, too, with all, beyond the Red Sea, dry and waste – has she displayed so many vicious pests.;kirkpatrick
1;24;91-93;And through all this abundance, bitter and grim, in panic naked humans ran – no holes to hide in here or heliotropic charms.;kirkpatrick
1;24;94-96;Behind their backs, the sinners’ hands were bound by snakes. These sent both tail and neck between the butts, then formed up front the ends in knots.;kirkpatrick
1;24;97-99;And near our point, at one of them (just look!) a serpent headlong hurled itself and pierced exactly at the knit of spine and nape.;kirkpatrick
1;24;100-102;Then, faster than you scribble ‘i’ or ‘o’, that shape caught fire, flash-flared and then (needs must) descended in cascading showers of ash.;kirkpatrick
1;24;103-105;There, lying in destruction on the ground, the dead dust gathered of its own accord, becoming instantly the self it was.;kirkpatrick
1;24;106-108;Compare: the phoenix (as the sages say) will come to its five-hundredth year, then die, but then, on its own pyre, be born anew.;kirkpatrick
1;24;109-111;Its lifelong food is neither grass nor grain, but nurture drawn from weeping balm and incense. Its shroud, at last, is fume of nard and myrrh.;kirkpatrick
1;24;112-114;The sinner, first, drops down as someone might when grappled down, not knowing how, by demons (or else some other epileptic turn),;kirkpatrick
1;24;115-117;who then, on rising, gazes all around, bewildered by the overwhelming ill that came just now upon him, sighing, staring.;kirkpatrick
1;24;118-120;So, too, this sinner, getting to his feet. What power and might in God! How harsh it is! How great the torrent of its vengeful blows!;kirkpatrick
1;24;121-123;My leader then demanded who he was. ‘I pelted down’ – the sinner, in reply – ‘to this wild gorge, right now, from Tuscany.;kirkpatrick
1;24;124-126;Beast living suited me, not human life, the mule that once I was. I’m Johnny Fucci, animal. Pistoia is my proper hole.’;kirkpatrick
1;24;127-129;I to my leader: ‘Tell him, “Don’t rush off!” and make him say what guilt has thrust him down. I’ve seen him. He’s a man of blood and wrath.’;kirkpatrick
1;24;130-132;The sinner, hearing this, made no pretense. He fixed on me a concentrated eye, and coloured up in brash embarrassment.;kirkpatrick
1;24;133-135;‘It pisses me right off,’ he then declared, ‘far more than being ripped away from life, that you have got to see me in this misery.;kirkpatrick
1;24;136-138;I can’t say “no” to what you ask of me. I’m stuck down here so deep ‘cos it was me, the thief who nicked the silver from the sanctuary.;kirkpatrick
1;24;139-141;Then I just lied – to grass up someone else. You won’t, however, laugh at seeing this. If ever you return from these dark dives,;kirkpatrick
1;24;142-144;prick up your ears and hear my prophecy: Pistoia first will slim and lose its Blacks. Then Florence, too, renews its laws and ranks.;kirkpatrick
1;24;145-147;Mars draws up fireballs from the Val di Magra, wrapped all around in clouds and turbulence. And these, in acrid, ever-driven storms,;kirkpatrick
1;24;148-150;will battle high above the Picene acre. A rapid bolt will rend the clouds apart, and every single White be seared by wounds.;kirkpatrick
1;24;151-151;I tell you this. I want it all to hurt.’;kirkpatrick
1;25;1-3;His words now reached their end. And then the robber hoisted hands on high – a fig-fuck formed in each – and screamed: ‘Take that! I’m aiming, God, at you!’;kirkpatrick
1;25;4-6;From that point on, the serpents were my friends. For one entwined its length around his neck as if to say: ‘I’d have him speak no more.’;kirkpatrick
1;25;7-9;And then another bound his arms down tight, and clinched itself so firmly round the front he could not shake or shiver in either limb.;kirkpatrick
1;25;10-12;Pistoia! Ah! Pistoia! Why not take a stand? Just burn yourself to blackened ash, and be no more. Your seed succeeds in doing only ill.;kirkpatrick
1;25;13-15;In all of Hell, through every murky ring, I saw no spirit facing God so proud, even that king flung down from Theban walls.;kirkpatrick
1;25;16-18;Away he fled. He spake no further word. And then there came, I saw, a wrathful centaur. ‘Where? Where is he,’ he called, ‘so sour and crude?’;kirkpatrick
1;25;19-21;Maremma, I should think – with all its swamps – has fewer snakes than he. They writhed from rump to where, on human features, lips begin.;kirkpatrick
1;25;22-24;Above its shoulders, stretched behind the nape, there lay a dragon, wings extended wide. And all it hits against, it sets on fire.;kirkpatrick
1;25;25-27;‘This centaur,’ so my teacher said, ‘is Cacus. He is the one – so many times – who caused a lake of gore to flood the Aventine.;kirkpatrick
1;25;28-30;He does not tread the path his brethren take. For spying, once, a mighty herd at hand, he made it all his own by furtive fraud.;kirkpatrick
1;25;31-33;Beneath the mace of Hercules (that god rained down a hundred blows, and he, perhaps, felt ten, no more) his devious doings ceased.’;kirkpatrick
1;25;34-36;So Virgil spoke. The centaur sped away. But now three spirits had approached beneath, though neither of us noticed they were there;kirkpatrick
1;25;37-39;until they shouted out: ‘So who are you?’ Our story-telling pausing at this point, we fixed attention wholly on that trio.;kirkpatrick
1;25;40-42;Among the three was none I recognized. And yet it chanced – as happens many times – that one was forced to speak another’s name,;kirkpatrick
1;25;43-45;inquiring: ‘Where has Cianfa got to now?’ At which (to shut my leader up) I placed a finger slantwise from my chin to nose.;kirkpatrick
1;25;46-48;If you are slow, my reader, to receive, in faith, what I’ll say now – no miracle. I saw it all, and yet can scarce believe.;kirkpatrick
1;25;49-51;While, eyebrows raised, I stared at these three men, a reptile hurled itself with all six feet at one, front on, and took a total hold.;kirkpatrick
1;25;52-54;It clenched the belly with its middle claws. With each anterior it seized an arm. It sank a forked fang deep in either cheek.;kirkpatrick
1;25;55-57;Along each loin it slithered out a leg, then struck its tail between the two, to take, now upwardly, a grip around the buttocks.;kirkpatrick
1;25;58-60;Ivy in tangles never barbed to tree so tight as this ferocious awfulness, linking its limbs in tendrils round that trunk.;kirkpatrick
1;25;61-63;As though the two were formed of warming wax, each clung to each and, mingling in their hues, neither now, seemingly, was what it was.;kirkpatrick
1;25;64-66;Like that, a flame runs flaring up a page and, just ahead, goes ever-darkening tints, not black as yet, and yet the white still dies.;kirkpatrick
1;25;67-69;The other two, at this, stared on. And each moaned out: ‘Ohimé, Agnello, how you change! Already, look, you’re neither two nor one.’;kirkpatrick
1;25;70-72;And yes, those two by now were both as one. That is: the outlines of the two appeared in one face only, two-ness lost and gone.;kirkpatrick
1;25;73-75;Two arms were fashioned out of four long strips. Thorax and stomach, loins and thighs and hips became such organs as you’ve never seen.;kirkpatrick
1;25;76-78;In each, the primal signs were all struck out. Two yet not either, as it seemed, this sick apparition. So, treading slow, it went its way.;kirkpatrick
1;25;79-81;The great green lizard, at the summer’s height, lashed by a dog star rage from hedge to hedge, crosses the path as though a lightning flash.;kirkpatrick
1;25;82-84;So, paunch high (darting at the two, of three, who still remained), inflamed and fierce, there came a snakelet, livid as a peppercorn.;kirkpatrick
1;25;85-87;This serpent pierced in one that spot where first we draw our nourishment, transfixing him. It then fell back, stretched out before his face.;kirkpatrick
1;25;88-90;The one transfixed gazed down but spoke no word. Rather, he yawned, his feet just planted there. Sick sleep, it seemed, had struck him hard, or fever.;kirkpatrick
1;25;91-93;He eyed the snake. The reptile eyed him back. Each gave out smoke in streams – the wound of one, the serpent’s jaws. The smoke streams slowly met.;kirkpatrick
1;25;94-96;Lucan! Be silent now, and tell no more your snaky tales of poor Sabellus and Nasidius. Give ear to what the bow will now unleash.;kirkpatrick
1;25;97-99;Ovid, be silent! Less ‘Cadmus’ and ‘Arethusa’! In turning verse, these two he may convert to snake or stream. I do not envy him.;kirkpatrick
1;25;100-102;For he, through metamorphosis, did not compose two species, glance on glance, whose forms disposed themselves exchanging actual substance.;kirkpatrick
1;25;103-105;"Each answered each in working through this rule: the serpent fashioned (from his tail) a fork; the wounded human dragged his footprints to.";kirkpatrick
1;25;106-108;The legs, now fastening at their inner thighs, adhered so well that soon the join between gave no clear sign of ever having been.;kirkpatrick
1;25;109-111;The cloven tail assumed the figure now of that which, over there, was lost to view. Hide softened here, but hardened over there.;kirkpatrick
1;25;112-114;I saw each arm retract and reach its pit. The paws, conversely, of that stubby newt lengthened as much as human feet grew short.;kirkpatrick
1;25;115-117;"The hindmost toes then curled around and clinched; these formed the member that a man conceals. The other wretch wrenched his own part in two.";kirkpatrick
1;25;118-120;As now, around this pair, the fumes still hang, a gauze of stranger colours – causing hair to sprout fresh here, while there it plucks it sleek –;kirkpatrick
1;25;121-123;the one rose up, the other fell down flat, yet, peering out, as this snout changed for that, neither could wrest from either evil eye beams.;kirkpatrick
1;25;124-126;Upright, the one dragged jowl across to temple. And then, from leakages of surplus pulp, a pair of ears appeared, on thinned-out jowls.;kirkpatrick
1;25;127-129;Whatever residue did not run back now gelled, and gave that face its human nose. The lips, plumped up to meet the need, gained bulk.;kirkpatrick
1;25;130-132;The other, lying flat, extends his muzzle. Then, just like snails when pulling in their horns, he draws his ears back, flush along his skull.;kirkpatrick
1;25;133-135;And now the tongue – once whole, and quick to speak – divides in two. The other finds his fork has closed right up. The furls of smoke now cease.;kirkpatrick
1;25;136-138;The soul, transmogrified to fearful beast, flees – hissing, snuffling – off across the pit. Spot on his track, the speaking presence spits.;kirkpatrick
1;25;139-141;And then he turns on him his novel back to tell the third: ‘I’ll see slick Buoso go as I did, bellyflop, around this track.’;kirkpatrick
1;25;142-144;Zymotic in the seventh bilge, I saw, then, change and counterchange. My only plea, if here my pen turns vain, must be sheer novelty.;kirkpatrick
1;25;145-147;And though my vision was a bit confused (spirit quite drained of all its energies), these souls could not so covertly pass by;kirkpatrick
1;25;148-150;that I should fail to see the cripple Puccio. Of three companions who had first come there, he, all alone, escaped from alteration.;kirkpatrick
1;25;151-151;The last was him that you, Gaville, weep for.;kirkpatrick
1;26;1-3;Rejoice, Florentia! You’ve grown so grand that over land and sea you spread your beating wings, and through the whole of Hell your name resounds.;kirkpatrick
1;26;4-6;Among those thieves and robbers there, I found, were five of your own citizens. I am ashamed. And you do not acquire, by this, great honour.;kirkpatrick
1;26;7-9;Yet if we dream, near dawn, of what is true, then you, not long from now, will surely feel what Prato aches to see for you – others, as well.;kirkpatrick
1;26;10-12;And were it now it would not be too soon. Would it were so, as rightly it should be. It weighs me down the more that time drags on.;kirkpatrick
1;26;13-15;We now moved off. And climbing by those stairs that, going down, had bleached us ivory, my leader, mounting up, pulled me along.;kirkpatrick
1;26;16-18;And so, proceeding on this lonely way through splintered rocks and outcrops from the ridge, feet without hands would not have gained advantage.;kirkpatrick
1;26;19-21;It grieved me then, it grieves me now once more, to fix my thoughts on what I witnessed there. Now, more than usual, I must hold mind back,;kirkpatrick
1;26;22-24;lest brain should speed where virtue does not guide. Thus if, by some propitious star (or more), I’ve come to good, I’d best not make it void.;kirkpatrick
1;26;25-27;A farmer, leaning on his hillside, rests. (It’s summer time, when he who lights the earth least hides his face from us.) This countryman,;kirkpatrick
1;26;28-30;as now the fly makes way for the mosquito, sees there, below him on the valley floor, (where he perhaps will plough and gather grapes);kirkpatrick
1;26;31-33;glow-worms in numbers such as now I saw, glittering around the dip of Pocket Eight, when I arrived there, looking to its depths.;kirkpatrick
1;26;34-36;Compare, as also in the Book of Kings: Elisha (once avenged by furious bears) beheld Elijah’s chariot drawn away;kirkpatrick
1;26;37-39;by horses rising to the Heavens, straight. His eye, unable to pursue, could see only the flame, like cloud wisp, rising high.;kirkpatrick
1;26;40-42;So, too, within the gullet of that ditch, these fires move round. None shows its thievery. Yet each fire stole some sinning soul away.;kirkpatrick
1;26;43-45;I stood there on the bridge and craned to look. Indeed, had I not clutched a nearby rock, I surely would (unpushed) have fallen in.;kirkpatrick
1;26;46-48;My leader, who had seen how hard I gazed, informed me now: ‘In all these fires are souls. Each one is swaddled in its inward blaze.’;kirkpatrick
1;26;49-51;‘Well, sir,’ I answered, ‘to be told by you, I am, of course, the surer. Myself, though, I’d already thought of that. I meant to ask:;kirkpatrick
1;26;52-54;“Who comes within that cloven-crested flame that seems to rise as from that pyre where, once, Eteocles was laid beside a brother slain?”’;kirkpatrick
1;26;55-57;‘Within this flame,’ so he now said, ‘suffering, are Ulysses and Diomed. As one, they face their nemesis, as they in rage were one.;kirkpatrick
1;26;58-60;Within their flame, the crime is now bewailed of those whose cunning wrought the Trojan horse – the door that freed the noble seed of Rome.;kirkpatrick
1;26;61-63;They mourn as well the ruse by which – though dead – young Deidamia must weep Achilles’ loss. They’re punished, too, for theft, of sacred statues.’;kirkpatrick
1;26;64-66;‘If they, within those tongues of fire, can speak, I beg you, sir,’ I said, ‘and beg again – so may each prayer be worth a thousand more –;kirkpatrick
1;26;67-69;that you do not forbid my waiting here until that flame with horns has come this way. You see I bend to it with great desire.’;kirkpatrick
1;26;70-72;‘Your prayer,’ he said, ‘is worthy of great praise, and I, most willingly, accede to it. But you must keep your tongue in tight control.;kirkpatrick
1;26;73-75;Leave me to speak. For I know very well what you desire. Nor would these two be quick, perhaps, to hear your words. They both are Greek.’;kirkpatrick
1;26;76-78;And when the flame had reached, in time and place, a point at which my leader thought it fit, I heard him form his utterances thus:;kirkpatrick
1;26;79-81;‘O you there, two within a single flame, if I, when living, won, in your eyes, merit, if merit, whether great or small, I won –;kirkpatrick
1;26;82-84;in penning my exalted lines of verse – do not move on. Let one of you declare, where, lost, he went, to come upon his death.’;kirkpatrick
1;26;85-87;The greater of those horns of ancient flame began to tear and waver, murmuring as fires will do when struggling in a wind.;kirkpatrick
1;26;88-90;Drawing its pinnacle this way and that, as though this truly were a tongue that spoke, it flung its utterance out, declaring:;kirkpatrick
1;26;91-93;‘Once I’d set my course from Circe (she had kept me near Gaeta for a year or more, before Aeneas, passing, named it that),;kirkpatrick
1;26;94-96;no tenderness for son, no duty owed to ageing fatherhood, no love that should have brought my wife Penelope delight,;kirkpatrick
1;26;97-99;could overcome in me my long desire, burning to understand how this world works, and know of human vices, worth and valour.;kirkpatrick
1;26;100-102;Out, then, across the open depths, I put to sea, a single prow, and with me all my friends – the little crew that had not yet abandoned me.;kirkpatrick
1;26;103-105;I saw both shorelines (one ran on to Spain, the other to Morocco), Sardinia and all those islands that our ocean bathes.;kirkpatrick
1;26;106-108;I and my company were old and slow. And yet, arriving at that narrow sound where Hercules had once set up his mark –;kirkpatrick
1;26;109-111;to warn that men should never pass beyond – I left Seville behind me on the right. To port already I had left Ceuta.;kirkpatrick
1;26;112-114;“Brothers,” I said, “a hundred thousand perils you have passed and reached the Occident. For us, so little time remains to keep;kirkpatrick
1;26;115-117;the vigil of our living sense. Do not deny your will to win experience, behind the sun, of worlds where no man dwells.;kirkpatrick
1;26;118-120;Hold clear in thought your seed and origin. You were not made to live as mindless brutes, but go in search of virtue and true knowledge.”;kirkpatrick
1;26;121-123;My men – attending to this little speech – I made so keen to take the onward way that even I could hardly have restrained them.;kirkpatrick
1;26;124-126;Wheeling our stern against the morning sun, we made our oars our wings in crazy flight, then on, and always leftward making gain.;kirkpatrick
1;26;127-129;Now every star around the alien pole I saw by night. Our own star sank so low it never rose above the ocean floor.;kirkpatrick
1;26;130-132;Five times the light that shines beneath the moon had flared anew – and five times, too, grown dim – since we had set our course on that high venture.;kirkpatrick
1;26;133-135;Ahead of us, a mountain now appeared, darkened through distance, soaring (to my eyes) higher by far than any ever seen.;kirkpatrick
1;26;136-138;We cheered for joy. This quickly turned to tears. For now a wind was born from that new land. Twisting, it struck at our forward timbers.;kirkpatrick
1;26;139-141;The waves and keel three times it swirled around. And then a fourth. The afterdeck rose up, the prow went down, as pleased Another’s will,;kirkpatrick
1;26;142-142;until once more the sea closed over us.’;kirkpatrick
1;27;1-3;The flame was upright now, and still. It meant to say no more. And so (the poet gently gave his leave) it went its way, away from us.;kirkpatrick
1;27;4-6;But close behind, another blaze came up, and made us turn (a sound, confusedly, had issued out) and glance towards its top.;kirkpatrick
1;27;7-9;This bellowed its inaugural – and justly so – with wailings from the smith who’d filed it smooth – these bellows echoing its victim’s moans –;kirkpatrick
1;27;10-12;So that, although, in form mere hollow bronze, it was, it seemed, transfixed with living pains.;kirkpatrick
1;27;13-15;So now those words which, dreadfully, could find no vent or outlet from their burning source, were spoken in an accent of their own.;kirkpatrick
1;27;16-18;But when these sounds had made their way along, and reached the tip which gave that flick and twist that tongues will give to any stream of air,;kirkpatrick
1;27;19-21;We heard: ‘You there! I square my words at you. I heard you say – in Lombard tones – just now: “Be out of it! I’ll rile on you no more.”;kirkpatrick
1;27;22-24;I’m here, perhaps belatedly. But you, I hope, will not be loath to stay and speak. You see how far from loath I am. And I burn!;kirkpatrick
1;27;25-27;If you have fallen even now to this blind world, leaving the land of lovely Italy (from which I carried any guilt I share),;kirkpatrick
1;27;28-30;Tell me: Romagna – is it peace or war? I was myself from those Urbino hills, the mountain yoke that first unlocks the Tiber.’;kirkpatrick
1;27;31-33;I held my head bowed low attentively, until my leader lightly touched my side, saying: ‘You speak. This one’s from Italy.’;kirkpatrick
1;27;34-36;And I, who had indeed got words prepared, began without delay to speak to him: ‘You, then, below! The soul that’s hidden there!;kirkpatrick
1;27;37-39;Your dear Romagna (despots all the lot) is not without, nor ever was, some war-at-heart. On leaving, though, I saw no open conflict.;kirkpatrick
1;27;40-42;"Ravenna stands as she has stood for years. The Eagle, blazon of the Clan Polenta, broods in her skies; its vanes hide even Cervia.";kirkpatrick
1;27;43-45;Forlì (her towers withstood that lengthy siege that left a blood-stained pile of French invaders) goes ever on beneath the green-clawed Lion.;kirkpatrick
1;27;46-48;The Mastiffs, old and young, of Fort Verucchio, vicious in lordship over Lord Montagna, still, as is usual, gnash and suck their bone.;kirkpatrick
1;27;49-51;And where Lamone and Santerno flow, the towns are schooled by Lion’s-Whelp-sur-Argent. Summer to winter, north to south, he cants.;kirkpatrick
1;27;52-54;"And then that place whose rim the Savio bathes – between the mountain and the plain it lies; it lives between high tyranny and freedom.";kirkpatrick
1;27;55-57;So, who are you? I beg you now to say. If you still wish your name to brave the world, be no more stiff than others are with you.’;kirkpatrick
1;27;58-60;The flame, as was its wont, first roared a while. Then, to and fro it writhed its pointed peak and finally pronounced this speaking breath:;kirkpatrick
1;27;61-63;‘Should I suppose, in answering, I spoke to any person who should ever see the world again, this flame would shake no more.;kirkpatrick
1;27;64-66;But since, if all I hear is true, there’s none who ever yet, alive, escaped these deeps, I may reply without the fear of infamy.;kirkpatrick
1;27;67-69;I, once great warlord, was a friar next, believing, bound by cord, I’d make amends. And my beliefs would all have been assured,;kirkpatrick
1;27;70-72;Had not there been (he’ll rot!) that sovereign priest who won me, firmly, back to former sins. Qua re and “how” I mean that you should hear.;kirkpatrick
1;27;73-75;While I was still, in form, such pulp and bone as, first, my mother gave to me, actions of mine all favoured rather fox than lion.;kirkpatrick
1;27;76-78;Stratagems, wiles and covert operations – I knew them all. These arts I so pursued that word of me rang out throughout the world.;kirkpatrick
1;27;79-81;But when I recognized that now I’d come to where we all in life ought, properly, to furl our sail and take our rigging in,;kirkpatrick
1;27;82-84;Whatever once had pleased me now annoyed. I vowed – repentant, shriven – all obedience. It might (what misery!) have worked out well.;kirkpatrick
1;27;85-87;"The foremost lord of our new Pharisees, who waged in Rome a war around the Lateran (never, of course, with Jew or Saracen;";kirkpatrick
1;27;88-90;"His foes were faithful Christians everyone; none had been present at the fall of Acre, none worked as trader in the Sultan’s souks),";kirkpatrick
1;27;91-93;Did not, considering his own account, consult his office or his holy rule, nor mine – that cord which makes its wearer thin.;kirkpatrick
1;27;94-96;As once, on Mount Soracte, Constantine required that Pope Silvester cure his leprosy, so he, mi-lording it, commanded me;kirkpatrick
1;27;97-99;To cure him of his fevered arrogance. He asked advice, and I maintained my silence. He seemed plain drunk in what he had to say.;kirkpatrick
1;27;100-102;But still he urged: “Don’t let your heart be doubtful. I grant you henceforth total absolution. Teach me how Penestrina may be razed.;kirkpatrick
1;27;103-105;The power is mine (you know it well) to unlock Heaven’s door. Or lock it fast. Hence these two keys. My predecessor held them far from dear.”;kirkpatrick
1;27;106-108;Such points – all weighty – drove me to the view that silence now was worse than quick assent. “Father,” I answered, “since you wash away;kirkpatrick
1;27;109-111;The sin that I must now be guilty of, some promise – generous though of mean extent – assures you triumph from your lofty throne.”;kirkpatrick
1;27;112-114;Now dead, Saint Francis came for me. But then a black alumnus of the Cherubim cried out: “Don’t cheat! You can’t dispose of him.;kirkpatrick
1;27;115-117;Down must he come, to join my squalid thralls. His sound advice was, after all, deceitful. And since that hour, I’ve hovered round his hair.;kirkpatrick
1;27;118-120;Repentance fails? There can’t be absolution, nor penitence when willing ill goes on. That is, by contradiction, impossibile.”;kirkpatrick
1;27;121-123;The pain I felt! I shook myself awake. To me he said (he took a grip): “Perhaps you never knew: I practise logic, too.”;kirkpatrick
1;27;124-126;To Minos he transported me, who then – eight times! – coiled tail around relentless spine. In utter ire, he bit this thing, and then;kirkpatrick
1;27;127-129;Declared: “Condemned is he to thievish fire.” So that is why, as you see here, I’m lost, and thus go dressed in inward bitterness.’;kirkpatrick
1;27;130-132;And once it reached the end of these few words, grieving, the flame went off along its way, thrashing its horn and wrenching it awry.;kirkpatrick
1;27;133-135;We now – my lord and I – went further on, rounding the ridge to find another arch to span Ditch Nine – wherein, a fee is paid,;kirkpatrick
1;27;136-136;Incurred by those who force fair deals apart.;kirkpatrick
1;28;1-3;Who could relate – even in words set loose from rhyme, even by telling it over and over – all that I witnessed now, the blood, the wounds.;kirkpatrick
1;28;4-6;There is no doubt: all human speech would fail. Our powers, whether of mind or tongue, cannot embrace that measure of understanding.;kirkpatrick
1;28;7-9;Suppose that, gathered in one single whole, were all those people of the fated South whose blood was shed in pain on the Apulian fields –;kirkpatrick
1;28;10-12;Be it as victims of the sons of Troy, or else, as Livy writes unerringly, in that long war where rings were heaped as spoils.;kirkpatrick
1;28;13-15;Then add all those who suffered grievous wounds in wars against the Norman king, Guiscardo, and also add that band whose bones are gleaned;kirkpatrick
1;28;16-18;At Ceperano still (where southerners, each one, proved traitorous). To Tagliacozzo, then, move on. There, ageing Elard won – by guile, not arms.;kirkpatrick
1;28;19-21;Were every lopped-off limb or part pierced through seen once again, that, even so, would far from equal all the foul display in Pocket Nine.;kirkpatrick
1;28;22-24;One I saw riven from his chin to fart hole. No barrel – midslat or moon rib missing – ever, I am certain, gaped as wide as that.;kirkpatrick
1;28;25-27;Between his legs his guts all dangled down, innards and heart on show, and that grim bag that turns to shit whatever gullets swallow.;kirkpatrick
1;28;28-30;My eyes were fixed and gazed on him alone. And he gazed back. Then, opening up his thorax, hands at work: ‘Look now,’ he said, ‘how wide I spread!;kirkpatrick
1;28;31-33;You see how mangled is the great Mohammed. Ali, ahead, wends weeping on his way, cloven in countenance from quiff to chin.;kirkpatrick
1;28;34-36;So, too, the others that you here observe, all in their lives sowed schism, scandal, discord. And that is why they all are here so splintered.;kirkpatrick
1;28;37-39;Back there a devil deftly decks us out in these cruel ornaments, and crops each page in every quire that comes upon his sword edge.;kirkpatrick
1;28;40-42;For, as we pass around this road of pain, each wound and gash is made entire and whole before we come to face him once again.;kirkpatrick
1;28;43-45;But who are you, who there sniff down at us and so perhaps are slow to meet the harm that you’ve been sentenced to for your own crime?’;kirkpatrick
1;28;46-48;‘Death has not reached him yet,’ my teacher said, ‘nor is he drawn by guilt to any pain. I, being dead, to give him full experience,;kirkpatrick
1;28;49-51;Am bound to lead him all through Hell, from gyre to gyre from ring to ring through every round. And this, I tell you, is the simple truth.’;kirkpatrick
1;28;52-54;To hear this said, a hundred (or yet more) stopped short. They looked in wonder from the ditch at me, in awe, forgetting their own agony.;kirkpatrick
1;28;55-57;‘Since you, perhaps, will shortly hail the sun, then say: If Fra Dolcino is not keen to join me soon, he’d better stockpile well,;kirkpatrick
1;28;58-60;Lest winter snow in drifts makes barriers bestowing triumph on the Novarese, which they’d not lightly come by otherwise.’;kirkpatrick
1;28;61-63;That was Mohammed who – as now to leave – had raised his foot while uttering these words. He placed it flat to ground and went his way.;kirkpatrick
1;28;64-66;Another then – his throat pierced through, his nose shorn off and level with his hanging brows, one ear alone, and only that to hear –;kirkpatrick
1;28;67-69;Now paused with all the rest to stare at me, but opened up, before the others might, his windpipe, crimson in its outward parts.;kirkpatrick
1;28;70-72;‘You there,’ he said, ‘whom guilt does not condemn, I’ve met you once on our Italian soil, unless I’m much beguiled by close resemblance.;kirkpatrick
1;28;73-75;If you should see once more the lovely plain that slopes between Vercelli and Marcabo, then call to mind again Da Medicina.;kirkpatrick
1;28;76-78;And let the two best men of Fano know (Guido and Angiolello, his peer), supposing that our foresight is not vain,;kirkpatrick
1;28;79-81;They’ll both be slung, their necks bedecked with stones, from boats that coast around Cattolica, betrayed in this by a villainous baron.;kirkpatrick
1;28;82-84;From Cyprus on to the Majorcan isles, Neptune has never seen a crime so great pulled off by pirates or Argolian Greeks.;kirkpatrick
1;28;85-87;That traitor with his single seeing eye (who rules a city that another with me here might wish his sight had still to hunger for);kirkpatrick
1;28;88-90;Will work it so that they will come to parley, then work it so they’ll need no prayer or vow to save them from the gales around Focara.’;kirkpatrick
1;28;91-93;And I in answer: ‘Show me. Make it clear – if you so wish I’ll take back news of you – who is that despot with the bitter view?’;kirkpatrick
1;28;94-96;At which, he put his hand around the jaw of one beside him, prising wide his mouth, and yelled out: ‘Here he is. And he can’t utter.;kirkpatrick
1;28;97-99;Exiled, he drowned all Caesar’s hesitations. For, “Anyone,” he said, “who’s well prepared will always suffer harm from titubation.”’;kirkpatrick
1;28;100-102;How dismal and confused he seemed to be, his tongue hacked out and hollow in his gullet, so headstrong once, this Curio, in parley.;kirkpatrick
1;28;103-105;"Then one came round with both his hands cut off. He raised his flesh stumps through the blackened air; he made his face drip filthy red with blood,";kirkpatrick
1;28;106-108;And yelled: ‘Me too! I’m Mosca, you’ll recall, who said, alas: “What’s done, well, that is done.” And this sowed evil seed for every Tuscan.’;kirkpatrick
1;28;109-111;To which I added: ‘Death to all your clan!’ So, piling always grief on top of grief, he went his way, a melancholic madman.;kirkpatrick
1;28;112-114;But I stayed there and, staring at the throng, I now saw something which, without more proof, I fear that I could never hope to speak of.;kirkpatrick
1;28;115-117;Conscience, though, lends me confidence to try. That good companion renders all men free under its breastplate, knowing we are pure.;kirkpatrick
1;28;118-120;I saw – I’m sure – and still I seem to now, in company with others in that herd, a torso striding by without a head,;kirkpatrick
1;28;121-123;Who held that head, though severed, by the hair. It swung as might a lantern from his hand. ‘Alas!’ it said, and stared at us in wonder.;kirkpatrick
1;28;124-126;Himself he made a lamp for his own light. So here were two in one and one in two. How that can be He knows who orders so.;kirkpatrick
1;28;127-129;He stood directly by the bridge foot now. He raised an arm (so, therefore, head and all) to throw his words the closer to us there.;kirkpatrick
1;28;130-132;And these words came: ‘See this, the harm, the hurt. Breathing you go still, watching on the dead. See now: is any punishment as great?;kirkpatrick
1;28;133-135;And so you may return with news of me, then know that I’m that Bertran de Born who gave false comfort to the youthful king.;kirkpatrick
1;28;136-138;Father and son, I set at mortal odds. No worse, with Absalom, Ahithophel, whose evil promptings prodded David on.;kirkpatrick
1;28;139-141;Since persons so close-linked I put apart, so I, alas, apart now bear my brain, thus severed from its root in this great trunk.;kirkpatrick
1;28;142-142;In me, then, counter-suffering can be seen.’;kirkpatrick
1;29;1-3;This multitude, their wounds so various, had made my eyes (the lights I look by) drunk. So now they wished to stand there, and just gaze.;kirkpatrick
1;29;4-6;But Virgil said: ‘Are you still staring on? Why is your seeing plunged so deep among such miserable, mutilated shades?;kirkpatrick
1;29;7-9;You’ve not done this in any other pocket. Do you imagine you can count them all? Well, think! This trench goes twenty miles around.;kirkpatrick
1;29;10-12;The moon already is below our feet. The time that we’re allowed to stay is short. And much is yet to see that still you’ve not.’;kirkpatrick
1;29;13-15;‘If you had only cared,’ I answered him, ‘to know the reasons for that lingering look, you would perhaps have let me stay still longer.’;kirkpatrick
1;29;16-18;But he (my leader), and myself behind, was pressing on. I answered thus, and added, as I went: ‘Within that den;kirkpatrick
1;29;19-21;Where I just now, with reason, fixed my eye, there is a spirit of my blood who weeps, grieving the guilt that, down there, sets its price.’;kirkpatrick
1;29;22-24;My teacher then: ‘Allow no wave of thought henceforth to break around his memory. Attend to other things. And let him be.;kirkpatrick
1;29;25-27;I saw him standing by the bridge foot there, still gesturing – a threatening finger raised – and heard his name called out: Geri del Bello.;kirkpatrick
1;29;28-30;You were so caught, intent upon the sight of that one there, once sire of Altafort, you did not care to look around. So off he went.’;kirkpatrick
1;29;31-33;‘His violent death,’ I now addressed my lord, ‘which goes yet unavenged by any kin, whose fate must be to share this lasting shame,;kirkpatrick
1;29;34-36;Inspires disdain in him. I judge that this is why he left, speaking no word to me. This all the more makes clear to me my duty.’;kirkpatrick
1;29;37-39;Our talk went on in such-like terms until we found the jutting spur that showed (or would, had there been light to see) the floor beyond.;kirkpatrick
1;29;40-42;I stood there high above the final cloister of Rottenpockets. All its postulants were present and revealed for us to see.;kirkpatrick
1;29;43-45;A host of lamentations shot around me, their iron barbs sharp-tipped with pain and pity. I covered up my ears with both my hands.;kirkpatrick
1;29;46-48;Such sicknesses as here there’d be if all contagions born of summer heat – from wards throughout Sardinia, the Chiana Vale, Maremma –;kirkpatrick
1;29;49-51;Were brought together in one single hole. That’s what it was, the stench that came from it, a fetor rising as from rotting limbs.;kirkpatrick
1;29;52-54;Veering still leftwards as we always did, we searched that ridge and reached its final crag. And there more vividly I came to view;kirkpatrick
1;29;55-57;The depths in which, unerringly, the power of justice – minister of One on High – will castigate those known on earth as frauds.;kirkpatrick
1;29;58-60;No greater woe, as I imagine it, was ever, even in Aegina, known – where plague infected every citizen and air;kirkpatrick
1;29;61-63;So dripped malignancy, its creatures all – down to the smallest worm – fell, sickening fast. This ancient race was then restored (so say;kirkpatrick
1;29;64-66;Those poets who believe it true) by seed of ants. Such woe appeared across the dark pit floor. See, in their different stooks, the spirits languishing.;kirkpatrick
1;29;67-69;Some sprawled across the stomach of the next, some over shoulders. Others, on all fours, dragged on (to make a change) along the road.;kirkpatrick
1;29;70-72;Without a word, we went on, step by step, still gazing at and listening to the sick. They could not lift their bodies from the ground.;kirkpatrick
1;29;73-75;I saw there leaning, one against the next – propped up as pairs of saucepans are to lose their heat – two, scabby-spotted head to toe.;kirkpatrick
1;29;76-78;And never have I seen a currycomb whisked (by a groom whose boss is waiting by, or else disgruntled to be woken up);kirkpatrick
1;29;79-81;So brisk as these attacked that raging itch – for which no salve can ever now be found – with biting fingernails to scrape at each.;kirkpatrick
1;29;82-84;With fingernails, each tore off showers of scabs, as might a fish knife when it’s skinning bream, or else, perhaps, some type with larger scales.;kirkpatrick
1;29;85-87;‘You there, whose fingers tear your chainmail off’ – to one of them my leader spoke these words – ‘employing them as pincers sometimes, too,;kirkpatrick
1;29;88-90;Now tell us (may your manicure endure, your nails work well to all eternity!), are there Italians sunk with you down there?’;kirkpatrick
1;29;91-93;‘We, wrecked and ruined, are Italians both.’ So, weeping, one of them made this reply. ‘But who are you that put to us this question?’;kirkpatrick
1;29;94-96;‘I’m one,’ my leader answered, ‘who descends with this still-living man from ledge to ledge. My purpose is to show him all of Hell.’;kirkpatrick
1;29;97-99;At this, the coupling that had held them sheared, and, trembling, each one turned himself to me, as others did who heard these words in echoes.;kirkpatrick
1;29;100-102;My good, kind teacher came up close to me, saying: ‘Just tell him what it is you want.’ And so, as he now wanted, I began:;kirkpatrick
1;29;103-105;‘So may the thought of you be never robbed from human memories in the first of lives, but live on brightly under many suns,;kirkpatrick
1;29;106-108;Tell me who you might be, and of what kin. Dread not – for all your foul and loathsome pain – but openly make known yourselves to me.’;kirkpatrick
1;29;109-111;‘I was,’ one answered, ‘an Aretine once. Albero of Siena had me burned alive. But I’m not brought for what I died for here.;kirkpatrick
1;29;112-114;O yes! It’s true, in jest I said to him: “I’ve got the knowhow. I can fly through air.” Then he – all eyes, excited, but no genius –;kirkpatrick
1;29;115-117;Was eager that I put my art on show. I did not do a Daedalus. For that alone, he got the one who called him son to burn me.;kirkpatrick
1;29;118-120;But Minos – not allowed to judge amiss – condemned me to this final slot because, in life, I practised as an alchemist.’;kirkpatrick
1;29;121-123;‘On land or sea,’ I turned towards the poet, ‘was anyone as gormless as these Sienese? Even the French aren’t that idiotic.’;kirkpatrick
1;29;124-126;At which, the other leper, overhearing, quipped in return: ‘Except, of course, for Stricca, who really knew what temperate spending is!;kirkpatrick
1;29;127-129;And Nick as well, the twit. He, in that garden where the clove seed grows, discovered first how rich the virtues of carnation are.;kirkpatrick
1;29;130-132;Omit, as well, those merry men with whom Kid d’Ascian consumed both farms and vines. Dazzledeye, too – who taught the boy such wisdom.;kirkpatrick
1;29;133-135;To see, however, who (like you) speaks here so anti-Sienese, just sharpen up your eye. My face – look hard – may give you your reply.;kirkpatrick
1;29;136-138;I am, you’ll see, the shadow of Capocchio. Alchemically, I falsified base metals and, if I eye you well, then you’ll recall;kirkpatrick
1;29;139-139;How marvellous an ape of nature I was.’;kirkpatrick
1;30;1-3;Think of that age when Juno – wracked with wrath, so envious of Semele – expressed her spite, over and over, against the blood of Thebes.;kirkpatrick
1;30;4-6;That was the time when Athamas ran mad. He saw his wife who carried, as she went, in either arm the load of their two sons,;kirkpatrick
1;30;7-9;And yelled: ‘Come on! Let’s spread those nets! I mean to stalk them all, both whelps and lioness.’ He then stretched out his unrelenting claws.;kirkpatrick
1;30;10-12;He grasped one child (Learchus was his name). He whirled him round. He dashed him on a stone. His wife drowned, loaded with their second son.;kirkpatrick
1;30;13-15;When, likewise, ever-turning Fate brought down, in flames, the Trojans from all-daring height – and so, together, king and kingdom broke –;kirkpatrick
1;30;16-18;Hecuba, grieving, wretched, now enslaved, first saw Polyxena, her daughter, dead, and then – to find there, lain along the margin;kirkpatrick
1;30;19-21;Of the sea, her youngest, Polydorus – barked in her lunacy like any cur, the pain of it so wrenched her mind askew.;kirkpatrick
1;30;22-24;And yet no fury known in Troy or Thebes was ever seen, in anyone, to strike so viciously at beast or human limb;kirkpatrick
1;30;25-27;As now I saw in two blank, naked shades – who, racing round that circle, gnashed and gored as swine do when their pigsty is unbarred.;kirkpatrick
1;30;28-30;One got Capocchio. At the very knot of neck and spine, his tusks sank in. Then round the hard pit floor he hauled him, belly scraping.;kirkpatrick
1;30;31-33;The Aretine (still there) spoke all atremble: ‘That banshee idiot is Gianni Schicchi. He rages on, and treats us all like that.’;kirkpatrick
1;30;34-36;‘Really?’ I answered. ‘Well, let’s hope his fangs don’t pierce your rear. But (not to trouble you), please say who’s that, before it springs away.’;kirkpatrick
1;30;37-39;‘That soul is known in legend,’ he declared. ‘It’s Myrrha the Depraved, beyond the bounds of love (as love should be) her father’s friend.;kirkpatrick
1;30;40-42;She made her way to meet him in that sin, shaping herself in counterfeit disguise. So, too, the other, shooting off. To win;kirkpatrick
1;30;43-45;A mare (the queen of all the herd) he shaped in counterfeit the guise of dying Buoso, whose testament, attested thus, was sound.’;kirkpatrick
1;30;46-48;And now, when these two raging shades, on whom till now I’d fixed my eye, had gone their way, I turned and looked at other ill-created souls.;kirkpatrick
1;30;49-51;And one I saw was fashioned like a lute, or would have been if severed at the groin, to amputate those parts where humans fork.;kirkpatrick
1;30;52-54;Dropsy (osmosis of a morbid flux): that discomposes, as the swellings rise, all natural fit – so face and paunch mismatch –;kirkpatrick
1;30;55-57;Constrained him, so his mouth hung open wide. So, too, in fever victims, wracked with thirst, one lip curls back, the lower meets the chin.;kirkpatrick
1;30;58-60;‘O you who pass and know no pain (though why I cannot understand) through this mean world,’ so he began, ‘behold and hold in mind;kirkpatrick
1;30;61-63;"The miseries of mastercraftsman Adam. I had, alive, my share of all I sought; and now I crave, alas, the merest water drop.";kirkpatrick
1;30;64-66;Those brooks that trickle down the high green hills to reach the Arno from the Casentine and, as they run, make channels, chill and moist,;kirkpatrick
1;30;67-69;Stand always in my sight. And not in vain: the image of them parches me far more than this disease that strips my face of meat.;kirkpatrick
1;30;70-72;Unbending justice probes me to the core. It takes its hint from regions where I sinned, meaning the more to put my sighs to flight.;kirkpatrick
1;30;73-75;Here Fort Romena stands, and here I forged fake specie, printed with the Baptist marque. On that account, I left, up there, my body burned.;kirkpatrick
1;30;76-78;Yet could I only glimpse those woeful souls – Guido or Sandro or their brother – here, I’d not exchange the Branda Spring for that.;kirkpatrick
1;30;79-81;Already in, there’s one of them, if those crazed shadows as they whirl around speak truth. What use is that to me? My limbs are bound.;kirkpatrick
1;30;82-84;If only I were still so light and lithe to travel in a hundred years one inch, already I’d have started on that path,;kirkpatrick
1;30;85-87;Seeking him out from all this filthy clan. And this ditch turns eleven miles around. Nor is it less than half a mile across!;kirkpatrick
1;30;88-90;I’m only in this mess because of them. They led me on. I counterfeited florins so each contained three carats-worth of dross.’;kirkpatrick
1;30;91-93;‘And who,’ I said, ‘are those two so-and-sos, steaming as wet hands do on winter days, those lying tight against your left frontier?’;kirkpatrick
1;30;94-96;‘I found them here,’ he said, ‘(they’ve not turned since) as soon as I showered down upon this midden. I do not think they’ll budge in all eternity.;kirkpatrick
1;30;97-99;Joseph was falsely charged by that “she” there. The other, just as false, is Sinon (Trojan-Greek!). Their biting fever brews that curdled reek.’;kirkpatrick
1;30;100-102;Then one of them, who took it much amiss – or so I’d guess, to hear his name so sullied – now thumped that tight-stretched belly with his fist.;kirkpatrick
1;30;103-105;It rumbled forth as though it were a drum. Adam (the master) countered with his arm to strike him no less hard across the face,;kirkpatrick
1;30;106-108;And said: ‘It may well be I cannot move, seeing how heavy I’ve become in limb. But still my arms are free to do the job.’;kirkpatrick
1;30;109-111;The answer came: ‘You weren’t as free as that when, arms trussed up, you went to mount the pyre. Your arms were free, though, in their forging days.’;kirkpatrick
1;30;112-114;‘There,’ the hydroptic said, ‘you speak mere truth. Yet, as a witness, you were not so true at Troy, when true words were required of you.’;kirkpatrick
1;30;115-117;‘Well, I spoke false, and you struck dodgy coin. But I’m here,’ Sinon said, ‘for one plain fault. You were accused of more than any demon.’;kirkpatrick
1;30;118-120;‘The horse! Remember that, you lying cheat!’ (This came in answer out of Swollenguts.) ‘Tough luck on you that all the world knows that.’;kirkpatrick
1;30;121-123;‘And tough on you,’ the Greek replied, ‘the thirst that cracks your bloated tongue, the bilge that swells that belly to a hedgerow round your eyes.’;kirkpatrick
1;30;124-126;At which: ‘Yeah, yeah’ (the coiner). ‘Sickness has stretched your mouth (what’s new?) to tearing point. I may be dry. I’m swollen, ripe with pus.;kirkpatrick
1;30;127-129;But you’re burnt-out. Your sick head throbs and aches. It wouldn’t take too much – a word or so – to make you lick the mirror of Narcissus.’;kirkpatrick
1;30;130-132;All ears, I strained to listen in – until I heard my teacher speak: ‘Go on! Just gaze! It won’t take much for me to fight with you.’;kirkpatrick
1;30;133-135;And when I heard his words, so near to wrath, I turned towards him with a shame that still, on calling it to mind, brews vertigo.;kirkpatrick
1;30;136-138;Like someone dreaming of a harm to come, who, dreaming, yearns for this to be some dream, and hence desires what is as though it weren’t,;kirkpatrick
1;30;139-141;So was I now. For wishing I could speak, and so excuse myself, I so excused myself, and did not think that all along I did.;kirkpatrick
1;30;142-144;‘Less shame,’ my master said to me, ‘makes clean far greater fault than yours has been. And so cast off the weight of all your misery.;kirkpatrick
1;30;145-147;Consider well. I’m always by your side. Remember this, if Fortune leads you on to where such spats as this are played out loud.;kirkpatrick
1;30;148-148;To wish to hear such stuff is pretty low.’;kirkpatrick
1;31;1-3;The self-same tongue that bit me first so hard that both my cheeks had coloured up, bright red, now offered once again its remedy.;kirkpatrick
1;31;4-6;So, too (as I have heard the story told), the spear that both Achilles and his father bore would cause a wound that spear alone could cure.;kirkpatrick
1;31;7-9;We turned our back upon the dismal deep, riding the bank that circles it around, and made our way across without more speech.;kirkpatrick
1;31;10-12;Here it was less than night and less than day, so that our seeing went no way ahead. But then I heard a horn ring out so loud;kirkpatrick
1;31;13-15;That thunder in comparison is vapid, and, turning back to see the echoing source, I fixed my eyes upon one single place.;kirkpatrick
1;31;16-18;After the great and grievous rout at which was lost the sacred band of Charlemagne, great Roland sounded notes of no such terror.;kirkpatrick
1;31;19-21;I had not held my head turned there for long when (so it seemed) I now saw many towers. And therefore, ‘Sir,’ I said, ‘what town is this?’;kirkpatrick
1;31;22-24;‘Because,’ he said, ‘through all these wreaths of shade you rush ahead too far from what’s at hand, you form of it a blurred and empty image.;kirkpatrick
1;31;25-27;You’ll see quite clearly when you soon arrive how greatly distance may deceive the sense. So drive yourself a little further on.’;kirkpatrick
1;31;28-30;Then, with great tenderness, he took my hand. He then went on: ‘And yet before we step ahead – so all these facts may seem less odd –;kirkpatrick
1;31;31-33;You ought to know that these aren’t towers. They’re giants. These stand within the well around its rim, navel height downwards, all the lot of them.’;kirkpatrick
1;31;34-36;As when a mist is thinning out, the gaze will, point by point, begin to recompose the figure hidden by the steam-thick air,;kirkpatrick
1;31;37-39;So, boring through that dense, dark atmosphere, approaching ever closer to the edge, false knowledge fled and fear grew yet more great.;kirkpatrick
1;31;40-42;For, as above its circling curtain wall, Montereggione boasts a crown of towers, so too above the bank that rings the well;kirkpatrick
1;31;43-45;Stood, towering here to half their body height, the dreadful giants, who are under threat from highest Jove whenever he wields thunder.;kirkpatrick
1;31;46-48;By now I saw, in each of these, the face, the chest and shoulders, areas of paunch, and, down the ribcage, all their dangling arms.;kirkpatrick
1;31;49-51;Nature did well, desisting from the art of forming animals like that. She thus deprived great Mars of his executors.;kirkpatrick
1;31;52-54;If she, on that account, did not repent of whales and elephants, to subtle minds this will seem right, and most intelligent.;kirkpatrick
1;31;55-57;For when the powers of working intellect are wed to strength and absolute ill will, then humans cannot find a place to hide.;kirkpatrick
1;31;58-60;In bulk and length, his face could be compared to that bronze pine cone in Saint Peter’s, Rome. His other bones were all in due proportion.;kirkpatrick
1;31;61-63;And so that bank (his fig leaf, ‘zone’ or apron, hanging around his loins below) displayed, above, up to his mane, as much of him;kirkpatrick
1;31;64-66;As three tall Frisians would boast in vain. I saw their thirty-eight-inch finger spans down from the point where cloaks are buckled on.;kirkpatrick
1;31;67-69;‘Raphèl maìamècche zabì almì,’ so screaming it began, that fearsome mouth, unfit to utter any sweeter psalm.;kirkpatrick
1;31;70-72;My leader aimed: ‘You idiotic soul! Stick to your horn. With that, give vent to wrath, or any passion that you chance to feel.;kirkpatrick
1;31;73-75;Just fumble round your neck, you great dumb thing. You’ll find the cord it’s tied to. There it rests. A chevron – see? – across your mighty breast.’;kirkpatrick
1;31;76-78;And then to me: ‘He stands his own accuser. It’s Nimrod there. Through his sick whim no single tongue is spoken anywhere.;kirkpatrick
1;31;79-81;So, let him be. We’ll not speak in that vein. For every tongue, to him, remains the same as his tongue is to others: quite unknown.’;kirkpatrick
1;31;82-84;"Now, turning left, we made a longer march; and there (the distance of a crossbow shot) we found a bigger ogre, fiercer still.";kirkpatrick
1;31;85-87;Who that lord was I cannot tell, who locked these shackles round him and about. He held his right arm bound in front, his left behind,;kirkpatrick
1;31;88-90;By one tight chain that – tangling down – was hitched a full five turns around the bits we saw, netherwards stretching from his neck to waist.;kirkpatrick
1;31;91-93;‘This one, in pride, was quick to prove his power against the majesty of Jupiter.’ Thus spoke my leader. ‘His reward is this.;kirkpatrick
1;31;94-96;By name Ephialtes, his deeds were done when giants caused the deities such dread. He can’t now budge the arm he wielded then.’;kirkpatrick
1;31;97-99;And I to him: ‘If it were possible to gain with my own eyes experience of measureless Briareus, that I’d like.’;kirkpatrick
1;31;100-102;‘Antaeus,’ he in answer said, ‘you’ll see not very far from here. And he – unchained and speaking, too – will lower us to sin’s last floor.;kirkpatrick
1;31;103-105;The one whom you so keenly wish to see is over there, a good way further on, constrained like these but fiercer still in mien.’;kirkpatrick
1;31;106-108;No earthquake, rude in vigour, ever struck a tower with such great force as Ephialtes, writhing round suddenly, now shook himself.;kirkpatrick
1;31;109-111;And, more than ever now in mortal fear, sheer terror would have done the trick, had I not seen the fetters that restrained him there.;kirkpatrick
1;31;112-114;And now, as we proceeded on our way, we came upon Antaeus, rising high (omitting head) five yards above the pit.;kirkpatrick
1;31;115-117;‘You there! Yes, you! In that propitious vale where Hannibal turned tail with all his men – and so made Scipio the heir of fame –;kirkpatrick
1;31;118-120;You brought as spoils a thousand lions back. And if, like all your brothers, you had joined in battle with the gods above, then (some;kirkpatrick
1;31;121-123;Believe) those earthborn sons might well have won. Then set us down – and please, no dark disdain – deep in Cocytus, locked by freezing keys.;kirkpatrick
1;31;124-126;Don’t make us trudge to Tityos or Typhon. This man can give you what you yearn to have. Therefore bend down. And do not twist your snout.;kirkpatrick
1;31;127-129;To earth he can still carry back your name. He’s living still – and so expects to, long, unless grace summons him before his time.’;kirkpatrick
1;31;130-132;My teacher spoke. The giant in great haste stretched out his hands – whose powerful clutch had once been felt by Hercules – to take him in his fist.;kirkpatrick
1;31;133-135;And Virgil, when he felt himself well held, now said to me: ‘Come here so I can take you!’ He packed us in – one bundle, him and me.;kirkpatrick
1;31;136-138;Just as the Garisenda tower, when viewed beneath its leaning side, appears to fall if any floating cloud should pass behind,;kirkpatrick
1;31;139-141;So, too, Antaeus seemed to me, as there I stood expecting him to bend. And now I’d willingly have gone some other way.;kirkpatrick
1;31;142-144;Yet lightly he set us, lightly, in those depths that eat at Lucifer and Judas, too. He did not, bowing so, make long delay,;kirkpatrick
1;31;145-145;But swayed again up straight as ship masts do.;kirkpatrick
1;32;1-3;If I had rhymes that rawly rasped and cackled (and chimed in keeping with that cacky hole at which, point down, all other rock rings peak),;kirkpatrick
1;32;4-6;I might then squeeze the juices of my thought more fully out of me. But since I don’t, not without dread, I bring myself to speak.;kirkpatrick
1;32;7-9;It’s not (no kidding) any sort of joke to form in words the universal bum, no task for tongues still whimpering ‘Mum!’ and ‘Dad!’;kirkpatrick
1;32;10-12;The Muses, though, may raise my verse – women who once helped Amphion lock Thebes in walls – so fact and word may not too far diverge.;kirkpatrick
1;32;13-15;You ill-begotten zombies, worst of all, who stand there where to utter is so hard, better had you been born as sheep or bezoars!;kirkpatrick
1;32;16-18;Now deep within the darkness of that well and further even than those giant feet, I stood and gazed sheer upwards at that wall;kirkpatrick
1;32;19-21;"When, out of nowhere, I heard: ‘Watch your step! Don’t plant those feet of yours on some poor head; we’re here all brothers in this sorry crowd.’";kirkpatrick
1;32;22-24;I turned at this, and now could see – around, and all beneath, my feet – a lake of ice that seemed far less like water than clear glass.;kirkpatrick
1;32;25-27;The Danube, even in winter Österreich, never congealed its currents to so thick a veil (the Don, neither, under freezing skies);kirkpatrick
1;32;28-30;As this. And if the crags of Tambernic had crashed down here – or Pike Pietrapana – its very fringe would not have cracked or creaked.;kirkpatrick
1;32;31-33;As frogs sit croaking in the harvest month (when country girls will dream of gleaning corn), their snouts just poking from the water line,;kirkpatrick
1;32;34-36;So too these shadows, fixed in ice lead-blue, to where, in shame, we start to blush, their teeth as rhythmic, beakily, as chattering storks.;kirkpatrick
1;32;37-39;And each one kept his face bent down. From mouths the cold, from hearts their miseries force a public testament to suffering.;kirkpatrick
1;32;40-42;I stood a while just gazing all around, then, glancing to my feet, I saw here two embraced so closely that their head hair mixed.;kirkpatrick
1;32;43-45;‘Go on,’ I said, ‘so tell me who you are, straining so tightly, tit to tit.’ Coupled, the two eased back their necks. Their faces now;kirkpatrick
1;32;46-48;Were straight to mine. Once moist within, their eyes welled up. The teardrops flowed toward their lips. But chill gripped these, to lock them in their holes.;kirkpatrick
1;32;49-51;"To wood wood never has been clamped so hard as these two were; and, overwhelmed with ire, each butted each like any pair of goats.";kirkpatrick
1;32;52-54;Another in the frost had lost both ears. Still gazing downwards, he was first to speak: ‘Why eye us so, as though we were your mirror?;kirkpatrick
1;32;55-57;If you’re so keen to know who these two are, that valley where Bisenzio streams down belonged to them, as to their father, earlier.;kirkpatrick
1;32;58-60;They issued from a single womb. And you may go, if you so please, through all of Cain finding no shadow freeze in aspic fitter,;kirkpatrick
1;32;61-63;Not Mordred, even – breast and shadow pierced by thrusts his “uncle,” great King Arthur, gave – neither Focaccia (source of strife), nor this one here,;kirkpatrick
1;32;64-66;Whose head, annoyingly, so cramps my view. His name was Sassolo Mascheroni, and you, if you are Tuscan, know him well.;kirkpatrick
1;32;67-69;However, not to drag out speeches further, be told that I’m Camiscion de’ Pazzi. I wait for Carlin. He’ll acquit me here.’;kirkpatrick
1;32;70-72;And then I saw a thousand mongrel faces bitten by frost. (I shiver, remembering – and always will – to see a frozen puddle.);kirkpatrick
1;32;73-75;Trembling, as ever, in the endless nip, onwards we went to reach the cone’s last core, where all the weight of everything weighs down.;kirkpatrick
1;32;76-78;And whether by intention, chance or fate (well, I don’t know!) pacing among these heads, hard in the face of one, I struck my foot.;kirkpatrick
1;32;79-81;It screeched out, whingingly: ‘Why stamp on me? Unless, of course, you’re here to take revenge for Montaperti. If not, why do me harm?’;kirkpatrick
1;32;82-84;I to my teacher: ‘Wait a little here. I’ll go and free myself of doubts with him. Then push me on as much as you desire.’;kirkpatrick
1;32;85-87;My leader paused. And, turning to the one still spitting curses out, I now inquired: ‘So who are you, to go on scolding others?’;kirkpatrick
1;32;88-90;‘And who are you? You trek through Antenora, bashing,’ he said, ‘at other people’s cheeks. Were you alive, I wouldn’t stand for it.’;kirkpatrick
1;32;91-93;‘I am alive,’ I answered him. ‘How dear to you I might become, if fame is what you thirst for! I could well note your name among the rest.’;kirkpatrick
1;32;94-96;‘I yearn,’ he answered, ‘for the opposite. Just go away and give me no more grief. You don’t know how to flatter in a bog like this.’;kirkpatrick
1;32;97-99;And so I grasped him tight against the scalp. ‘You’ll name yourself,’ I said to him. ‘If not, you’ll find no single bristle on your topknot.’;kirkpatrick
1;32;100-102;‘Don’t think,’ he said, ‘because you pluck my curls, I mean to say or show you bugger all, bomb as you may my skull ten thousand times.’;kirkpatrick
1;32;103-105;I’d got him twisted in my fingers now, and had, already, yanked out several tufts. He barked, but kept his eyes held firmly down.;kirkpatrick
1;32;106-108;Another yelling now: ‘What’s with you, Big Mouth? Not satisfied to castanet cold jaws? You bark as well. What devil’s got to you?’;kirkpatrick
1;32;109-111;And then I said: ‘I’d have you speak no more. You’re vile, you traitor. I’ll augment your shame, I’ll carry in your name a true report.’;kirkpatrick
1;32;112-114;‘Go on,’ he answered, ‘gossip all you like. But don’t, if you get out of here, be silent concerning him, his tongue so slick.;kirkpatrick
1;32;115-117;He weeps for having fingered French-y silver. Now you can say: “I saw that man from Duera. He dwells where all the sinners keep quite cool.”;kirkpatrick
1;32;118-120;And should you ask me: “Are there others here?” Beside you, there is Abbot Beccheria, the one whose gizzard Florence sawed right through.;kirkpatrick
1;32;121-123;Then Ghibelline Jack, I guess, is further on, with Ganelon and Tebaldello, too. He slid the doors of sleeping Faience back.’;kirkpatrick
1;32;124-126;By now we had already gone our way. But then I saw two frozen in one single hole, one head a headpiece to the one below.;kirkpatrick
1;32;127-129;As bread is mangled by some famished mouth, so too the higher gnawed the lower head, precisely where the nape and brainstem meet.;kirkpatrick
1;32;130-132;The dying Tydeus in this same way, in loathing, chewed the brows of dead Menalippus, gnawing the skull and everything besides.;kirkpatrick
1;32;133-135;‘O you who by so bestial a show make known your hatred for the one you eat, now tell me – why? I give my word,’ I said,;kirkpatrick
1;32;136-138;‘If you complain of him with proper cause, then once I know his name and how he sinned, I’ll make you in the world a fair return,;kirkpatrick
1;32;139-139;Provided means of speech do not fall dry.’;kirkpatrick
1;33;1-3;Jaws lifted now from that horrible dish, the sinner – wiping each lip clean on hair that fringed the mess he’d left the head in, at its rear –;kirkpatrick
1;33;4-6;Began: ‘You ask that I should tell anew the pain that hopelessly, in thought alone, before I voice it, presses at my heart.;kirkpatrick
1;33;7-9;Yet if I may, by speaking, sow the fruit of hate to slur this traitor, caught between my teeth, then words and tears, you’ll see, will flow as one.;kirkpatrick
1;33;10-12;Who you might be, I do not know, nor how you’ve come to be down here. But when you speak, you seem (there’s little doubt) a Florentine.;kirkpatrick
1;33;13-15;You need to see: I was Count Ugolino. This is Ruggieri, the archbishop, there. I’ll tell you now why we two are so close.;kirkpatrick
1;33;16-18;That I, in consequence of his vile thoughts, was captured – though I trusted in this man – and after died, I do not need to say.;kirkpatrick
1;33;19-21;But this cannot have carried to your ears: that is, how savagely I met my death. You’ll hear it now, and know if he has injured me.;kirkpatrick
1;33;22-24;One scant slit in the walls of Eaglehouse (because of me, they call it now the Hunger Tower. Be sure, though: others will be locked up there);kirkpatrick
1;33;25-27;Had shown me, in the shaft that pierces it, many new moons by now, when this bad dream tore wide the veil of what my future was.;kirkpatrick
1;33;28-30;This thing here then appeared to me as Master of the Hounds, who tracked the wolf – his cubs as well – out on the hill where Lucca hides from Pisa.;kirkpatrick
1;33;31-33;In front, as leaders of the pack, he placed the clans Gualandi, Sismond and Lanfranchi, their bitches hunting eager, lean and smart.;kirkpatrick
1;33;34-36;"The chase was brief. Father and sons, it seemed, were wearying; and soon – or so it seemed – I saw those sharp fangs raking down their flanks.";kirkpatrick
1;33;37-39;I woke before the day ahead had come, and heard my sons (my little ones were there) cry in their sleep and call out for some food.;kirkpatrick
1;33;40-42;How hard you are if, thinking what my heart foretold, you do not feel the pain of it. Whatever will you weep for, if not that?;kirkpatrick
1;33;43-45;By now they all had woken up. The time was due when, as routine, our food was brought. Yet each was doubtful, thinking of their dream.;kirkpatrick
1;33;46-48;Listening, I heard the door below locked shut, then nailed in place against that dreadful tower. I looked in their dear faces, spoke no word.;kirkpatrick
1;33;49-51;I did not weep. Inward, I turned to stone. They wept. And then my boy Anselmo spoke: “What are you staring at? Father, what’s wrong?”;kirkpatrick
1;33;52-54;And so I held my tears in check and gave no answer all that day, nor all the night that followed on, until another sun came up.;kirkpatrick
1;33;55-57;A little light had forced a ray into our prison, so full of pain. I now could see on all four faces my own expression.;kirkpatrick
1;33;58-60;Out of sheer grief, I gnawed on both my hands. And they – who thought I did so from an urge to eat – all, on the instant, rose and said:;kirkpatrick
1;33;61-63;“Father, for us the pain would be far less if you would choose to eat us. You, having dressed us in this wretched flesh, ought now to strip it off.”;kirkpatrick
1;33;64-66;So I kept still, to not increase their miseries. And that day and the day beyond, we all were mute. Hard, cruel earth, why did you not gape wide?;kirkpatrick
1;33;67-69;As then we reached the fourth of all those days, Gaddo pitched forward, stretching at my feet. “Help me,” he said. “Why don’t you help me, Dad!”;kirkpatrick
1;33;70-72;And there he died. You see me here. So I saw them, the three remaining, falling one by one between the next days – five and six – then let;kirkpatrick
1;33;73-75;Myself, now blind, feel over them, calling on each, now all were dead, for two days more. Then hunger proved a greater power than grief.’;kirkpatrick
1;33;76-78;His words were done. Now, eyes askew, he grabbed once more that miserable skull – his teeth, like any dog’s teeth, strong against the bone.;kirkpatrick
1;33;79-81;Pisa, you scandal of the lovely land where ‘yes’ is uttered in the form of sì, your neighbours may be slow to punish you,;kirkpatrick
1;33;82-84;But let those reefs, Capraia and Gorgogna, drift, as a barrage, to the Arno’s mouth, so that your people – every one – are drowned.;kirkpatrick
1;33;85-87;So what if – as the rumour goes – the great Count Ugolino did cheat fortresses from you. You had no right to crucify his children.;kirkpatrick
1;33;88-90;Pisa, you are a newborn Thebes! Those boys were young. That made them innocent. I’ve named just two. I now name Uguiccione and Brigata.;kirkpatrick
1;33;91-93;We now moved on, and came to where the ice so roughly swaddled yet another brood. And these – not hunched – bend back for all to view.;kirkpatrick
1;33;94-96;They weep. Yet weeping does not let them weep. Their anguish meets a blockage at the eye. Turned in, this only makes their heartache more.;kirkpatrick
1;33;97-99;Their tears first cluster into frozen buds, and then – as though a crystal visor – fill the socket of the eye beneath each brow.;kirkpatrick
1;33;100-102;My own face now – a callus in the chill – had ceased to be a throne to any kind of sentiment. And yet, in spite of all,;kirkpatrick
1;33;103-105;It seemed I felt a wind still stirring here. ‘Who moves these currents, sir?’ I now inquired. ‘At depths like these, aren’t vapours wholly spent?’;kirkpatrick
1;33;106-108;He in reply: ‘Come on, come on! You soon will stand where your own probing eye shall see what brings this drizzling exhalation on.’;kirkpatrick
1;33;109-111;A case of icy-eye-scab now yelled out: ‘You must be souls of such malignancy you merit placement in the lowest hole.;kirkpatrick
1;33;112-114;Prise off this rigid veil, to clear my eyes. Let me awhile express the grief that swells in my heart’s womb before my tears next freeze.’;kirkpatrick
1;33;115-117;I answered: ‘Are you asking help from me? Tell me who you are. Then I’ll free your gaze, or travel – promise! – to the deepest ice.’;kirkpatrick
1;33;118-120;‘I,’ he replied, ‘am Brother Alberigo, I of the Evil Orchard, Fruiterer. Here I receive exquisite dates for figs.’;kirkpatrick
1;33;121-123;‘Oh,’ I now said, ‘so you’re already dead?’ ‘Well, how my body fares above,’ he said, ‘still in the world, my knowledge is not sure.;kirkpatrick
1;33;124-126;There is, in Ptolomea, this advantage, that souls will frequently come falling down before Fate Atropos has granted them discharge.;kirkpatrick
1;33;127-129;I very willingly will tell you more, but only scrape this tear-glaze from my face. The instant any soul commits, like me,;kirkpatrick
1;33;130-132;Some act of treachery, a demon takes possession of that body-form and rules its deeds until its time is done. Swirling,;kirkpatrick
1;33;133-135;The soul runs downwards to this sink. And so the body of that shade behind – a-twitter all this winter through – still seems up there, perhaps.;kirkpatrick
1;33;136-138;You’re bound to know, arriving only now, that this is Signor Branca (“Hookhand”) d’Oria. Years have gone by since he was ice-packed here.’;kirkpatrick
1;33;139-141;‘I think,’ I said, ‘that this must be a con. For how can Branca d’Oria be dead? He eats and drinks and sleeps and puts his clothes on.’;kirkpatrick
1;33;142-144;‘Recall that ditch,’ he said, ‘named Rotklorsville, where, higher up, they brew adhesive pitch? Well, long before Mike Zanche got to that,;kirkpatrick
1;33;145-147;Hookhand was history. He, as proxy, left a devil in his skin (his kinsman’s here as well, the one who planned with him the double-cross).;kirkpatrick
1;33;148-150;But please, now reach your hand to me down here. Open my eyes for me.’ I did not open them. To be a swine in this case was pure courtesy.;kirkpatrick
1;33;151-153;You Genovese, deviant, deranged and stuffed with every sort of vicious canker! Why have you not been wiped yet from the earth?;kirkpatrick
1;33;154-156;Among the worst of all the Romagnuoli I found there one of yours, whose works were such his soul already bathes in Cocytus.;kirkpatrick
1;33;157-157;His body, seemingly, lives on above.;kirkpatrick
1;34;1-3;‘Vexilla regis prodeunt inferni, marching towards us. Fix your eyes ahead,’ my teacher said, ‘and see if you can see it.’;kirkpatrick
1;34;4-6;As though a windmill when a thick fog breathes – or else when dark night grips our hemisphere – seen from a distance, turning in the wind,;kirkpatrick
1;34;7-9;So there a great contraption had appeared. And I now shrank, against the wind, behind my guide. There were no glades to shelter in.;kirkpatrick
1;34;10-12;I was by now (I write this verse in fear) where all the shades in ice were covered up, transparent as are straws preserved in glass.;kirkpatrick
1;34;13-15;Some lay there flat, and some were vertical, one with head raised, another soles aloft, another like a bow, bent face to feet.;kirkpatrick
1;34;16-18;And then when we had got still further on, where now my master chose to show to me that creature who had once appeared so fair,;kirkpatrick
1;34;19-21;He drew away from me and made me stop, saying: ‘Now see! Great Dis! Now see the place where you will need to put on all your strength.’;kirkpatrick
1;34;22-24;How weak I now became, how faded, dry – reader, don’t ask, I shall not write it down – for anything I said would fall far short.;kirkpatrick
1;34;25-27;I neither died nor wholly stayed alive. Just think yourselves, if your minds are in flower, what I became, bereft of life and death.;kirkpatrick
1;34;28-30;The emperor of all these realms of gloom stuck from the ice at mid-point on his breast. And I am more a giant (to compare);kirkpatrick
1;34;31-33;Than any giant measured to his arm. So now you’ll see how huge the whole must be, when viewed in fit proportion to that limb.;kirkpatrick
1;34;34-36;If, once, he was as lovely as now vile, when first he raised his brow against his maker, then truly grief must all proceed from him.;kirkpatrick
1;34;37-39;How great a wonder it now seemed to me to see three faces on a single head! The forward face was bright vermilion.;kirkpatrick
1;34;40-42;The other two attached themselves to that along each shoulder on the central point, and joined together at the crest of hair.;kirkpatrick
1;34;43-45;The rightward face was whitish, dirty yellow. The left in colour had the tint of those beyond the source from which the Nile first swells.;kirkpatrick
1;34;46-48;Behind each face there issued two great vanes, all six proportioned to a fowl like this. I never saw such size in ocean sails.;kirkpatrick
1;34;49-51;Not feathered as a bird’s wings are, bat-like and leathery, each fanned away the air, so three unchanging winds moved out from him,;kirkpatrick
1;34;52-54;Cocytus being frozen hard by these. He wept from all six eyes. And down each chin both tears and bloody slobber slowly ran.;kirkpatrick
1;34;55-57;In every mouth he mangled with his teeth (as flax combs do) a single sinning soul, but brought this agony to three at once.;kirkpatrick
1;34;58-60;Such biting, though, affects the soul in front as nothing to the scratching he received. His spine at times showed starkly, bare of skin.;kirkpatrick
1;34;61-63;‘That one up there, condemned to greater pain, is Judas Iscariot,’ my teacher said, ‘his head inside, his feet out, wriggling hard.;kirkpatrick
1;34;64-66;The other two, their heads hung down below, are Brutus, dangling from the jet black snout (look how he writhes there, uttering not a word!),;kirkpatrick
1;34;67-69;The other Cassius with burly look. But night ascends once more. And now it’s time for us to quit this hole. We’ve seen it all.’;kirkpatrick
1;34;70-72;As he desired, I clung around his neck. With purpose, he selected time and place and, when the wings had opened to the full,;kirkpatrick
1;34;73-75;He took a handhold on the furry sides, and then, from tuft to tuft, he travelled down between the shaggy pelt and frozen crust.;kirkpatrick
1;34;76-78;But then, arriving where the thigh bone turns (the hips extended to their widest there), my leader, with the utmost stress and strain,;kirkpatrick
1;34;79-81;Swivelled his head to where his shanks had been and clutched the pelt like someone on a climb, so now I thought: ‘We’re heading back to Hell.’;kirkpatrick
1;34;82-84;‘Take care,’ my teacher said. ‘By steps like these,’ breathless and panting, seemingly all-in, ‘we need to take our leave of so much ill.’;kirkpatrick
1;34;85-87;Then through a fissure in that rock he passed and set me down to perch there on its rim. After, he stretched his careful stride towards me.;kirkpatrick
1;34;88-90;Raising my eyes, I thought that I should see Lucifer where I, just now, had left him, but saw instead his legs held upwards there.;kirkpatrick
1;34;91-93;If I was struggling then to understand, let other dimwits think how they’d have failed to see what point it was that I now passed.;kirkpatrick
1;34;94-96;‘Up on your feet!’ my teacher ordered me. ‘The way is long, the road is cruelly hard. The sun is at the morning bell already.’;kirkpatrick
1;34;97-99;This was no stroll, where now we had arrived, through any palace but a natural cave. The ground beneath was rough, the light was weak.;kirkpatrick
1;34;100-102;‘Before my roots are torn from this abyss, sir,’ I said, upright, ‘to untangle me from error, say a little more of this.;kirkpatrick
1;34;103-105;Where is the ice? And why is that one there fixed upside down? How is it that the sun progressed so rapidly from evening on to day?’;kirkpatrick
1;34;106-108;And he in answer: ‘You suppose you’re still on that side of the centre where I gripped that wormrot’s coat that pierces all the world.;kirkpatrick
1;34;109-111;While I was still descending, you were there. But once I turned, you crossed, with me, the point to which from every part all weight drags down.;kirkpatrick
1;34;112-114;So you stand here beneath the hemisphere that now is covered wholly with dry land, under the highest point at which there died;kirkpatrick
1;34;115-117;The one man sinless in his birth and life. Your feet are set upon a little sphere that forms the other aspect of Giudecca.;kirkpatrick
1;34;118-120;It’s morning here. It’s evening over there. The thing that made a ladder of his hair is still as fixed as he has always been.;kirkpatrick
1;34;121-123;Falling from Heaven, when he reached this side, the lands that then spread out to southern parts in fear of him took on a veil of sea.;kirkpatrick
1;34;124-126;These reached our hemisphere. Whatever now is visible to us – in flight perhaps from him – took refuge here and left an empty space.’;kirkpatrick
1;34;127-129;There is a place (as distant from Beelzebub as his own tomb extends in breadth) known not by sight but rather by the sound;kirkpatrick
1;34;130-132;Of waters falling in a rivulet eroding, by the winding course it takes (which is not very steep), an opening in that rock.;kirkpatrick
1;34;133-135;So now we entered on that hidden path, my lord and I, to move once more towards a shining world. We did not care to rest.;kirkpatrick
1;34;136-138;We climbed, he going first and I behind, until through some small aperture I saw the lovely things the skies above us bear.;kirkpatrick
1;34;139-139;Now we came out, and once more saw the stars.;kirkpatrick
