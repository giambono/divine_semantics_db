1;1;1;1;At one point midway on our path in life,;kirkpatrick
1;1;2;2;I came around and found myself now searching;kirkpatrick
1;1;3;3;through a dark wood, the right way blurred and lost.;kirkpatrick
1;1;4;4;How hard it is to say what that wood was,;kirkpatrick
1;1;5;5;a wilderness, savage, brute, harsh and wild.;kirkpatrick
1;1;6;6;Only to think of it renews my fear!;kirkpatrick
1;1;7;7;So bitter, that thought, that death is hardly more so.;kirkpatrick
1;1;8;8;But since my theme will be the good I found there, I mean;kirkpatrick
1;1;9;9;to speak of other things I saw.;kirkpatrick
1;1;10;10;I do not know, I cannot rightly say,;kirkpatrick
1;1;11;11;how ﬁrst I came to be here – so full of sleep,;kirkpatrick
1;1;12;12;that moment, abandoning the true way on.;kirkpatrick
1;1;13;13;But then, on reaching the foot of a hill;kirkpatrick
1;1;14;14;which marked the limit of the dark ravine;kirkpatrick
1;1;15;15;that had before so pierced my heart with panic,;kirkpatrick
1;1;16;16;I looked to that height and saw its shoulders;kirkpatrick
1;1;17;17;already clothed in rays from the planet;kirkpatrick
1;1;18;18;that leads all others, on any road, aright.;kirkpatrick
1;1;19;19;My fears, at this, were somewhat quieted,;kirkpatrick
1;1;20;20;though terror, awash in the lake of my heart,;kirkpatrick
1;1;21;21;had lasted all the night I’d passed in anguish.;kirkpatrick
1;1;22;22;And then, like someone labouring for breath;kirkpatrick
1;1;23;23;who, safely reaching shore from open sea,;kirkpatrick
1;1;24;24;still turns and stares across those perilous waves,  so in;kirkpatrick
1;1;25;25;my mind – my thoughts all ﬂeeing still –;kirkpatrick
1;1;26;26;I turned around to marvel at that strait;kirkpatrick
1;1;27;27;that let no living soul pass through till now.;kirkpatrick
1;1;28;28;And then – my weary limbs a little rested –;kirkpatrick
1;1;29;29;I started up the lonely scree once more,;kirkpatrick
1;1;30;30;the foot that drives me always set the lower.;kirkpatrick
1;1;31;31;But look now! Almost as the scarp begins,;kirkpatrick
1;1;32;32;a leopard, light and lively, svelte and quick,;kirkpatrick
1;1;33;33;its coat displaying a dappled marking.;kirkpatrick
1;1;34;34;This never ceased to dance before my face.;kirkpatrick
1;1;35;35;No. On it came, so bothering my tread;kirkpatrick
1;1;36;36;I’d half a mind at every turn to turn.;kirkpatrick
1;1;37;37;The time, however, was the hour of dawn.;kirkpatrick
1;1;38;38;The sun was mounting, and those springtime stars;kirkpatrick
1;1;39;39;that rose along with it when Holy Love;kirkpatrick
1;1;40;40;ﬁrst moved to being all these lovely things.;kirkpatrick
1;1;41;41;So these – the morning hour, the gentle season –;kirkpatrick
1;1;42;42;led me to ﬁnd good reason for my hopes,;kirkpatrick
1;1;43;43;seeing that creature with its sparkling hide.;kirkpatrick
1;1;44;44;Yet not so far that no fear pressed on me,;kirkpatrick
1;1;45;45;to see, appearing now, a lion face.;kirkpatrick
1;1;46;46;This, as it seemed, came on and on towards me;kirkpatrick
1;1;47;47;hungrily, its ravening head held high,;kirkpatrick
1;1;48;48;so that, in dread, the air around it trembled.;kirkpatrick
1;1;49;49;And then a wolf. And she who, seemingly,;kirkpatrick
1;1;50;50;was gaunt yet gorged on every kind of craving –;kirkpatrick
1;1;51;51;and had already blighted many a life –;kirkpatrick
1;1;52;52;so heavily oppressed my thought with fears,;kirkpatrick
1;1;53;53;which spurted even at the sight of her,;kirkpatrick
1;1;54;54;I lost all hope of reaching to those heights.;kirkpatrick
1;1;55;55;We all so willingly record our gains,;kirkpatrick
1;1;56;56;until the hour that leads us into loss.;kirkpatrick
1;1;57;57;Then every single thought is tears and sadness.;kirkpatrick
1;1;58;58;So, now, with me. That brute which knows no peace;kirkpatrick
1;1;59;59;came ever nearer me and, step by step,;kirkpatrick
1;1;60;60;drove me back down to where the sun is mute.;kirkpatrick
1;1;61;61;As I went, ruined, rushing to that low,;kirkpatrick
1;1;62;62;there had, before my eyes, been oﬀered one;kirkpatrick
1;1;63;63;who seemed – long silent – to be faint and dry.;kirkpatrick
1;1;64;64;Seeing him near in that great wilderness,;kirkpatrick
1;1;65;65;to him I screamed my ‘Miserere’ : ‘Save me,;kirkpatrick
1;1;66;66;whatever – shadow or truly man – you be.’;kirkpatrick
1;1;67;67;"His answer came to me: ‘No man; a man";kirkpatrick
1;1;68;68;I was in times long gone. Of Lombard stock,;kirkpatrick
1;1;69;69;my parents both by patria were Mantuan.;kirkpatrick
1;1;70;70;And I was born, though late, sub Iulio.;kirkpatrick
1;1;71;71;I lived at Rome in good Augustus’ day,;kirkpatrick
1;1;72;72;in times when all the gods were lying cheats.;kirkpatrick
1;1;73;73;I was a poet then. I sang in praise;kirkpatrick
1;1;74;74;of all the virtues of Anchises’ son. From Troy;kirkpatrick
1;1;75;75;he came – proud Ilion razed in ﬂame.;kirkpatrick
1;1;76;76;But you turn back. Why seek such grief and harm?;kirkpatrick
1;1;77;77;Why climb no higher up that lovely hill?;kirkpatrick
1;1;78;78;The cause and origin of joy shines there.’;kirkpatrick
1;1;79;79;‘So, could it be,’ I answered him (my brow,;kirkpatrick
1;1;80;80;in shy respect, bent low), ‘you are that Virgil,;kirkpatrick
1;1;81;81;whose words (a river running full) ﬂow wide?;kirkpatrick
1;1;82;82;You are the light and glory of all poets.;kirkpatrick
1;1;83;83;May this well serve me: my unending care, the love so;kirkpatrick
1;1;84;84;great, that’s made me search your writings through!;kirkpatrick
1;1;85;85;You are my teacher. You, my lord and law.;kirkpatrick
1;1;86;86;From you alone I took the ﬁne-tuned style;kirkpatrick
1;1;87;87;that has, already, brought me so much honour.;kirkpatrick
1;1;88;88;See there? That beast! I turned because of that.;kirkpatrick
1;1;89;89;Help me – your wisdom’s known – escape from her.;kirkpatrick
1;1;90;90;To every pulsing vein, she brings a tremor.’;kirkpatrick
1;1;91;91;Seeing my tears, he answered me: ‘There is;kirkpatrick
1;1;92;92;another road. And that, if you intend;kirkpatrick
1;1;93;93;to quit this wilderness, you’re bound to take.;kirkpatrick
1;1;94;94;That beast – you cry out at the very sight –;kirkpatrick
1;1;95;95;lets no one through who passes on her way.;kirkpatrick
1;1;96;96;"She blocks their progress; and there they all die.";kirkpatrick
1;1;97;97;She by her nature is cruel, so vicious;kirkpatrick
1;1;98;98;she never can sate her voracious will,;kirkpatrick
1;1;99;99;but, feasting well, is hungrier than before.;kirkpatrick
1;1;100;100;She couples, a mate to many a creature,;kirkpatrick
1;1;101;101;and will so with more, till at last there comes;kirkpatrick
1;1;102;102;the hunting hound that deals her death and pain.;kirkpatrick
1;1;103;103;He will not feed on dross or cash or gelt,;kirkpatrick
1;1;104;104;but thrive in wisdom, virtue and pure love.;kirkpatrick
1;1;105;105;Born he shall be between the felt and felt.;kirkpatrick
1;1;106;106;To all the shores where Italy bows down;kirkpatrick
1;1;107;107;(here chaste Camilla died of wounds, Turnus,;kirkpatrick
1;1;108;108;Euryalus and Nisus, too), he’ll bring true health.;kirkpatrick
1;1;109;109;Hunting that animal from every town,;kirkpatrick
1;1;110;110;at last he’ll chase her back once more to Hell,;kirkpatrick
1;1;111;111;from which invidia has set her loose.;kirkpatrick
1;1;112;112;Therefore, considering what’s best for you,;kirkpatrick
1;1;113;113;I judge that you should follow, I should guide,;kirkpatrick
1;1;114;114;and hence through an eternal space lead on.;kirkpatrick
1;1;115;115;There you shall hear shrill cries of desperation,;kirkpatrick
1;1;116;116;and see those spirits, mourning ancient pain,;kirkpatrick
1;1;117;117;who all cry out for death to come once more.;kirkpatrick
1;1;118;118;And then you’ll see those souls who live in ﬁre,;kirkpatrick
1;1;119;119;content to hope – whenever that time comes –;kirkpatrick
1;1;120;120;they too will be among the blessed choirs.;kirkpatrick
1;1;121;121;To which if you shall ever wish to rise,;kirkpatrick
1;1;122;122;a soul will come far worthier than me.;kirkpatrick
1;1;123;123;I must, at parting, leave you in her care.;kirkpatrick
1;1;124;124;Reigning on high, there is an Emperor;kirkpatrick
1;1;125;125;who, since I was a rebel to His law,;kirkpatrick
1;1;126;126;will not allow His city as my goal.;kirkpatrick
1;1;127;127;He rules there, sovereign over every part.;kirkpatrick
1;1;128;128;There stands His capital, His lofty throne.;kirkpatrick
1;1;129;129;Happy the one He chooses for His own.’;kirkpatrick
1;1;130;130;‘Poet,’ I answered, ‘by that God whose name;kirkpatrick
1;1;131;131;you never knew, I beg you, I entreat –;kirkpatrick
1;1;132;132;so I may ﬂee this ill and worse – that you;kirkpatrick
1;1;133;133;now lead me on to where you’ve spoken of,;kirkpatrick
1;1;134;134;to ﬁnd the gate where now Saint Peter stands,;kirkpatrick
1;1;135;135;and all those souls that you say are so sad.’;kirkpatrick
1;1;136;136;"He made to move; and I came close behind.";kirkpatrick
1;2;137;1;Daylight was leaving us, and darkened air;kirkpatrick
1;2;138;2;drawing those creatures that there are on earth;kirkpatrick
1;2;139;3;from all their labours. I alone, I was;kirkpatrick
1;2;140;4;the only one preparing, as in war,;kirkpatrick
1;2;141;5;to onward-march and bear the agony;kirkpatrick
1;2;142;6;that thought will now unfailingly relate.;kirkpatrick
1;2;143;7;I call the Muses. You great Heights of Mind;kirkpatrick
1;2;144;8;bring help to me. You, Memory, wrote down all I saw.;kirkpatrick
1;2;145;9;Now shall be seen the greatness of your power.;kirkpatrick
1;2;146;10;‘You,’ I began, ‘my poet and my guide,;kirkpatrick
1;2;147;11;look at me hard. Am I in spirit strong enough;kirkpatrick
1;2;148;12;for you to trust me on this arduous road?;kirkpatrick
1;2;149;13;As you once told, the sire of Silvius;kirkpatrick
1;2;150;14;travelled, though still in fragile ﬂesh, to realms immortal,;kirkpatrick
1;2;151;15;and his senses all alive.;kirkpatrick
1;2;152;16;Nor will it seem (to those of intellect);kirkpatrick
1;2;153;17;unﬁtting if the enemy of ill;kirkpatrick
1;2;154;18;should thus so greatly favour him, recalling;kirkpatrick
1;2;155;19;what ﬂowed from him, his name and who he was.;kirkpatrick
1;2;156;20;He was ordained, in empyrean skies,;kirkpatrick
1;2;157;21;father of Rome – its noble heart and empire.;kirkpatrick
1;2;158;22;To speak the truth: that city – and the sphere;kirkpatrick
1;2;159;23;it ruled – was founded as the sacred seat;kirkpatrick
1;2;160;24;for all inheritors of great Saint Peter.;kirkpatrick
1;2;161;25;You have proclaimed the glory of that march.;kirkpatrick
1;2;162;26;He on his way heard prophecies that led;kirkpatrick
1;2;163;27;to all his triumphs and the papal stole.;kirkpatrick
1;2;164;28;And then Saint Paul, the chosen Vessel, came –;kirkpatrick
1;2;165;29;to carry back a strengthening of that faith;kirkpatrick
1;2;166;30;from which salvation always must begin.;kirkpatrick
1;2;167;31;But me? Why me? Who says I can? I’m not;kirkpatrick
1;2;168;32;your own Aeneas. I am not Saint Paul.;kirkpatrick
1;2;169;33;No one – not me! – could think I’m ﬁt for this.;kirkpatrick
1;2;170;34;Surrendering, I’ll say I’ll come. I fear;kirkpatrick
1;2;171;35;this may be lunacy. You, though, are wise.;kirkpatrick
1;2;172;36;You know me better than my own words say.’;kirkpatrick
1;2;173;37;And so – as though unwanting every want,;kirkpatrick
1;2;174;38;so altering all at every altering thought,;kirkpatrick
1;2;175;39;now drawing back from everything begun –;kirkpatrick
1;2;176;40;I stood there on the darkened slope, fretting;kirkpatrick
1;2;177;41;away from thought to thought the bold intent;kirkpatrick
1;2;178;42;that seemed so very urgent at the outset.;kirkpatrick
1;2;179;43;‘Supposing I have heard your words aright,’;kirkpatrick
1;2;180;44;the shadow of that noble mind replied,;kirkpatrick
1;2;181;45;‘your heart is struck with ignominious dread.;kirkpatrick
1;2;182;46;This, very often, is the stumbling block;kirkpatrick
1;2;183;47;that turns a noble enterprise oﬀ-course –;kirkpatrick
1;2;184;48;as beasts will balk at shadows falsely seen.;kirkpatrick
1;2;185;49;I mean that you should free yourself from fear,;kirkpatrick
1;2;186;50;and therefore I will say why ﬁrst I came,;kirkpatrick
1;2;187;51;and what – when ﬁrst I grieved for you – I heard.;kirkpatrick
1;2;188;52;With those I was whose lives are held in poise.;kirkpatrick
1;2;189;53;And then I heard a lady call – so blessed,;kirkpatrick
1;2;190;54;so beautiful – I begged her tell me all she wished.;kirkpatrick
1;2;191;55;Her eyes were shining brighter than the stars.;kirkpatrick
1;2;192;56;Then gently, softly, calmly, she began,;kirkpatrick
1;2;193;57;speaking, as angels might, in her own tongue:;kirkpatrick
1;2;194;58;“You, Mantuan, so courteous in spirit,;kirkpatrick
1;2;195;59;your fame endures undimmed throughout the world, and;kirkpatrick
1;2;196;60;shall endure as still that world moves onwards.;kirkpatrick
1;2;197;61;A man most dear to me – though not to fate –;kirkpatrick
1;2;198;62;is so entrammelled on the lonely hill;kirkpatrick
1;2;199;63;that now he turns, all terror, from the way.;kirkpatrick
1;2;200;64;My fear must be he’s so bewildered there;kirkpatrick
1;2;201;65;that – hearing all I’ve heard of him in Heaven – I rise too;kirkpatrick
1;2;202;66;late to bring him any aid.;kirkpatrick
1;2;203;67;Now make your way. With all your eloquence,;kirkpatrick
1;2;204;68;and all that his deliverance demands,;kirkpatrick
1;2;205;69;lend him your help so I shall be consoled.;kirkpatrick
1;2;206;70;For me you’ll go, since I am Beatrice.;kirkpatrick
1;2;207;71;And I have come from where I long to be.;kirkpatrick
1;2;208;72;Love is my mover, source of all I say.;kirkpatrick
1;2;209;73;When I again appear before my Lord,;kirkpatrick
1;2;210;74;then I shall often speak your praise to Him.”;kirkpatrick
1;2;211;75;She now fell silent. I began to speak:;kirkpatrick
1;2;212;76;“Lady of worth and truth, through you alone;kirkpatrick
1;2;213;77;the human race goes far beyond that bourne;kirkpatrick
1;2;214;78;set by the moon’s sphere, smallest of all the skies.;kirkpatrick
1;2;215;79;To me, so welcome is your least command,;kirkpatrick
1;2;216;80;I’d be too slow had I obeyed by now.;kirkpatrick
1;2;217;81;You need no more declare to me your will.;kirkpatrick
1;2;218;82;But tell me why you take so little care;kirkpatrick
1;2;219;83;and, down to this dead middle point, you leave;kirkpatrick
1;2;220;84;the spacious circle where you burn to go.”;kirkpatrick
1;2;221;85;“Since you desire to know so inwardly,;kirkpatrick
1;2;222;86;then brieﬂy,” she replied, “I’ll tell you why;kirkpatrick
1;2;223;87;I feel no dread at entering down here.;kirkpatrick
1;2;224;88;We dread an object when (but only when);kirkpatrick
1;2;225;89;that object has the power to do some harm.;kirkpatrick
1;2;226;90;Nothing can otherwise occasion fear.;kirkpatrick
1;2;227;91;I was created by the grace of God –;kirkpatrick
1;2;228;92;and so untouched by all your wretchedness.;kirkpatrick
1;2;229;93;Nor can the ﬂames of this great ﬁre assail me.;kirkpatrick
1;2;230;94;In Heaven, a Lady, gracious, good and kind,;kirkpatrick
1;2;231;95;grieves at the impasse that I send you to,;kirkpatrick
1;2;232;96;and, weeping, rives the high, unbending rule.;kirkpatrick
1;2;233;97;She called Lucia, seeking her reply.;kirkpatrick
1;2;234;98;‘Your faithful one,’ she said to her, ‘has now;kirkpatrick
1;2;235;99;great need of you. I give him to your care.’;kirkpatrick
1;2;236;100;Lucia is the enemy of harm.;kirkpatrick
1;2;237;101;Leaving her place, she came at once to where;kirkpatrick
1;2;238;102;I sat – Rachel, long-famed, along with me.;kirkpatrick
1;2;239;103;‘You, Beatrice, are, in truth, God’s praise.;kirkpatrick
1;2;240;104;Why not,’ she said, ‘make haste to him? He loves you,;kirkpatrick
1;2;241;105;and, loving you, he left the common herd.;kirkpatrick
1;2;242;106;Can you not hear the pity of his tears?;kirkpatrick
1;2;243;107;Do you not see the death that beats him down,;kirkpatrick
1;2;244;108;swirling in torrents that no sea could boast?’;kirkpatrick
1;2;245;109;No one on earth has ever run more rapidly;kirkpatrick
1;2;246;110;to seek advantage or else ﬂee from harm,;kirkpatrick
1;2;247;111;than I in coming – when her words were done –;kirkpatrick
1;2;248;112;down from that throne of happiness, to trust;kirkpatrick
1;2;249;113;in your great words, their dignity and truth.;kirkpatrick
1;2;250;114;These honour you and those who hear you speak.”;kirkpatrick
1;2;251;115;When she had said her say, in tears, she turned;kirkpatrick
1;2;252;116;her eyes away – which shone as she was weeping.;kirkpatrick
1;2;253;117;And this made me far quicker still for you.;kirkpatrick
1;2;254;118;So now, as she had willed, I made my way,;kirkpatrick
1;2;255;119;to raise you from the face of that brute beast;kirkpatrick
1;2;256;120;that stole your pathway up that lovely hill.;kirkpatrick
1;2;257;121;What is it, then? What’s wrong? Why still delay?;kirkpatrick
1;2;258;122;Why fondle in your heart such feebleness?;kirkpatrick
1;2;259;123;Why wait? Be forthright, brave and resolute.;kirkpatrick
1;2;260;124;Three ladies of the court of Paradise,;kirkpatrick
1;2;261;125;in utmost happiness watch over you.;kirkpatrick
1;2;262;126;My own words promise you the utmost good.’;kirkpatrick
1;2;263;127;As little ﬂowers bend low on freezing nights,;kirkpatrick
1;2;264;128;closed tight, but then, as sunlight whitens them, grow;kirkpatrick
1;2;265;129;upright on their stems and fully open,;kirkpatrick
1;2;266;130;now so did I. My wearied powers reviving,;kirkpatrick
1;2;267;131;there ran such wealth of boldness to my heart;kirkpatrick
1;2;268;132;that openly – all new and free – I now began:;kirkpatrick
1;2;269;133;‘How quick in compassion her aid to me!;kirkpatrick
1;2;270;134;And you – so courteous, prompt to accede;kirkpatrick
1;2;271;135;to all the words of truth that she has oﬀered!;kirkpatrick
1;2;272;136;You, as you speak, have so disposed my heart;kirkpatrick
1;2;273;137;in keen desire to journey on the way;kirkpatrick
1;2;274;138;that I return to ﬁnd my ﬁrst good purpose.;kirkpatrick
1;2;275;139;Set oﬀ! A single will inspires us both.;kirkpatrick
1;2;276;140;You are my lord, my leader and true guide.’;kirkpatrick
1;2;277;141;All this I said to him as he moved on.;kirkpatrick
1;2;278;142;I entered on that deep and wooded road.;kirkpatrick
1;3;279;1;‘Through me you go to the grief-wracked city.;kirkpatrick
1;3;280;2;Through me to everlasting pain you go.;kirkpatrick
1;3;281;3;Through me you go and pass among lost souls.;kirkpatrick
1;3;282;4;Justice inspired my exalted Creator.;kirkpatrick
1;3;283;5;I am a creature of the Holiest Power,;kirkpatrick
1;3;284;6;of Wisdom in the Highest and of Primal Love.;kirkpatrick
1;3;285;7;Nothing till I was made was made, only;kirkpatrick
1;3;286;8;eternal beings. And I endure eternally.;kirkpatrick
1;3;287;9;Surrender as you enter every hope you have.’;kirkpatrick
1;3;288;10;These were the words that – written in dark tones –;kirkpatrick
1;3;289;11;I saw there, on the summit of a door.;kirkpatrick
1;3;290;12;I turned: ‘Their meaning, sir, for me is hard.’;kirkpatrick
1;3;291;13;And he in answering (as though he understood):;kirkpatrick
1;3;292;14;‘You needs must here surrender all your doubts.;kirkpatrick
1;3;293;15;All taint of cowardice must here be dead.;kirkpatrick
1;3;294;16;We now have come where, as I have said, you’ll see;kirkpatrick
1;3;295;17;in suﬀering the souls of those who’ve lost;kirkpatrick
1;3;296;18;the good that intellect desires to win.’;kirkpatrick
1;3;297;19;And then he placed his hand around my own,;kirkpatrick
1;3;298;20;he smiled, to give me some encouragement,;kirkpatrick
1;3;299;21;and set me on to enter secret things.;kirkpatrick
1;3;300;22;Sighing, sobbing, moans and plaintive wailing;kirkpatrick
1;3;301;23;all echoed here through air where no star shone,;kirkpatrick
1;3;302;24;and I, as this began, began to weep.;kirkpatrick
1;3;303;25;Discordant tongues, harsh accents of horror,;kirkpatrick
1;3;304;26;tormented words, the twang of rage, strident;kirkpatrick
1;3;305;27;voices, the sound, as well, of smacking hands,;kirkpatrick
1;3;306;28;together these all stirred a storm that swirled;kirkpatrick
1;3;307;29;for ever in the darkened air where no time was,;kirkpatrick
1;3;308;30;as sand swept up in breathing spires of wind.;kirkpatrick
1;3;309;31;I turned, my head tight-bound in confusion,;kirkpatrick
1;3;310;32;to say to my master: ‘What is it that I hear?;kirkpatrick
1;3;311;33;Who can these be, so overwhelmed by pain?’;kirkpatrick
1;3;312;34;‘This baleful condition is one,’ he said,;kirkpatrick
1;3;313;35;‘that grips those souls whose lives, contemptibly, were;kirkpatrick
1;3;314;36;void alike of honour and ill fame.;kirkpatrick
1;3;315;37;These all co-mingle with a noisome choir;kirkpatrick
1;3;316;38;of angels who – not rebels, yet not true;kirkpatrick
1;3;317;39;to God – existed for themselves alone.;kirkpatrick
1;3;318;40;To keep their beauty whole, the Heavens spurned them.;kirkpatrick
1;3;319;41;Nor would the depths of Hell receive them in,;kirkpatrick
1;3;320;42;lest truly wicked souls boast over them.’;kirkpatrick
1;3;321;43;And I: ‘What can it be, so harsh, so heavy,;kirkpatrick
1;3;322;44;that draws such loud lamentings from these crowds?’;kirkpatrick
1;3;323;45;And he replied: ‘My answer can be brief:;kirkpatrick
1;3;324;46;These have no hope that death will ever come.;kirkpatrick
1;3;325;47;And so degraded is the life they lead;kirkpatrick
1;3;326;48;all look with envy on all other fates.;kirkpatrick
1;3;327;49;The world allows no glory to their name.;kirkpatrick
1;3;328;50;Mercy and Justice alike despise them.;kirkpatrick
1;3;329;51;Let us not speak of them. Look, then pass on.’;kirkpatrick
1;3;330;52;I did look, intently. I saw a banner;kirkpatrick
1;3;331;53;running so rapidly, whirling forwards,;kirkpatrick
1;3;332;54;that nothing, it seemed, would ever grant a pause.;kirkpatrick
1;3;333;55;Drawn by that banner was so long a trail;kirkpatrick
1;3;334;56;of men and women I should not have thought;kirkpatrick
1;3;335;57;that death could ever have unmade so many.;kirkpatrick
1;3;336;58;A few I recognized. And then I saw –;kirkpatrick
1;3;337;59;and knew beyond all doubt – the shadow of the one;kirkpatrick
1;3;338;60;who made, from cowardice, the great denial.;kirkpatrick
1;3;339;61;So I, at that instant, was wholly sure;kirkpatrick
1;3;340;62;this congregation was that worthless mob;kirkpatrick
1;3;341;63;loathsome alike to God and their own enemies.;kirkpatrick
1;3;342;64;These wretched souls were never truly live.;kirkpatrick
1;3;343;65;They now went naked and were sharply spurred;kirkpatrick
1;3;344;66;by wasps and hornets, thriving all around.;kirkpatrick
1;3;345;67;The insects streaked the face of each with blood.;kirkpatrick
1;3;346;68;"Mixing with tears, the lines ran down; and then";kirkpatrick
1;3;347;69;were garnered at their feet by ﬁlthy worms.;kirkpatrick
1;3;348;70;And when I’d got myself to look beyond,;kirkpatrick
1;3;349;71;others, I saw, were ranged along the bank;kirkpatrick
1;3;350;72;of some great stream. ‘Allow me, sir,’ I said,;kirkpatrick
1;3;351;73;‘to know who these might be. What drives them on,;kirkpatrick
1;3;352;74;and makes them all (as far, in this weak light,;kirkpatrick
1;3;353;75;as I discern) so eager for the crossing?’;kirkpatrick
1;3;354;76;‘That will, of course, be clear to you,’ he said,;kirkpatrick
1;3;355;77;‘when once our footsteps are set ﬁrm upon;kirkpatrick
1;3;356;78;the melancholic shores of Acheron.’;kirkpatrick
1;3;357;79;At this – ashamed, my eyes cast humbly down,;kirkpatrick
1;3;358;80;fearing my words had weighed on him too hard –;kirkpatrick
1;3;359;81;I held my tongue until we reached the stream.;kirkpatrick
1;3;360;82;Look now! Towards us in a boat there came;kirkpatrick
1;3;361;83;an old man, yelling, hair all white and aged,;kirkpatrick
1;3;362;84;‘Degenerates! Your fate is sealed! Cry woe!;kirkpatrick
1;3;363;85;Don’t hope you’ll ever see the skies again!;kirkpatrick
1;3;364;86;I’m here to lead you to the farther shore,;kirkpatrick
1;3;365;87;into eternal shadow, heat and chill.;kirkpatrick
1;3;366;88;And you there! You! Yes, you, the living soul!;kirkpatrick
1;3;367;89;Get right away from this gang! These are dead.’;kirkpatrick
1;3;368;90;But then, on seeing that I did not move:;kirkpatrick
1;3;369;91;‘You will arrive by other paths and ports.;kirkpatrick
1;3;370;92;You’ll start your journey from a diﬀerent beach.;kirkpatrick
1;3;371;93;A lighter hull must carry you across.’;kirkpatrick
1;3;372;94;‘Charon,’ my leader, ‘don’t torment yourself.;kirkpatrick
1;3;373;95;For this is willed where all is possible;kirkpatrick
1;3;374;96;that is willed there. And so demand no more.’;kirkpatrick
1;3;375;97;The ﬂeecy wattles of the ferry man –;kirkpatrick
1;3;376;98;who plied across the liverish swamp, eyeballs;kirkpatrick
1;3;377;99;encircled by two wheels of ﬂame – fell mute.;kirkpatrick
1;3;378;100;But not the other souls. Naked and drained,;kirkpatrick
1;3;379;101;their complexions changed. Their teeth began;kirkpatrick
1;3;380;102;(hearing his raw command) to gnash and grind.;kirkpatrick
1;3;381;103;They raged, blaspheming God and their own kin,;kirkpatrick
1;3;382;104;the human race, the place and time, the seed;kirkpatrick
1;3;383;105;from which they’d sprung, the day that they’d been born.;kirkpatrick
1;3;384;106;And then they came together all as one,;kirkpatrick
1;3;385;107;wailing aloud along the evil margin;kirkpatrick
1;3;386;108;that waits for all who have no fear of God.;kirkpatrick
1;3;387;109;Charon the demon, with his hot-coal eyes,;kirkpatrick
1;3;388;110;glared what he meant to do. He swept all in.;kirkpatrick
1;3;389;111;He struck at any dawdler with his oar.;kirkpatrick
1;3;390;112;In autumn, leaves are lifted, one by one,;kirkpatrick
1;3;391;113;away until the branch looks down and sees;kirkpatrick
1;3;392;114;its tatters all arrayed upon the ground.;kirkpatrick
1;3;393;115;In that same way did Adam’s evil seed;kirkpatrick
1;3;394;116;hurtle, in sequence, from the river rim,;kirkpatrick
1;3;395;117;as birds that answer to their handler’s call.;kirkpatrick
1;3;396;118;Then oﬀ they went, to cross the darkened ﬂood.;kirkpatrick
1;3;397;119;And, long before they’d landed over there,;kirkpatrick
1;3;398;120;another ﬂock assembled in their stead.;kirkpatrick
1;3;399;121;Attentively, my master said: ‘All those,;kirkpatrick
1;3;400;122;dear son, who perish in the wrath of God,;kirkpatrick
1;3;401;123;meet on this shore, wherever they were born.;kirkpatrick
1;3;402;124;And they are eager to be shipped across.;kirkpatrick
1;3;403;125;Justice of God so spurs them all ahead;kirkpatrick
1;3;404;126;that fear in them becomes that sharp desire.;kirkpatrick
1;3;405;127;But no good soul will ever leave from here.;kirkpatrick
1;3;406;128;And so when Charon thus complains of you,;kirkpatrick
1;3;407;129;you may well grasp the sense that sounds within.’;kirkpatrick
1;3;408;130;His words now done, the desolate terrain;kirkpatrick
1;3;409;131;trembled with such great violence that the thought soaks;kirkpatrick
1;3;410;132;me once more in a terriﬁed sweat.;kirkpatrick
1;3;411;133;The tear-drenched earth gave out a gust of wind,;kirkpatrick
1;3;412;134;erupting in a ﬂash of bright vermilion,;kirkpatrick
1;3;413;135;that overwhelmed all conscious sentiment.;kirkpatrick
1;3;414;136;I fell like someone gripped by sudden sleep.;kirkpatrick
1;4;415;1;Thunder rolling heavily in my head;kirkpatrick
1;4;416;2;shattered my deep sleep. Startled, I awoke –;kirkpatrick
1;4;417;3;as though just shaken in some violent grip.;kirkpatrick
1;4;418;4;And then once more my sight grew ﬁrm and ﬁxed.;kirkpatrick
1;4;419;5;Now upright and again afoot, I scanned,;kirkpatrick
1;4;420;6;intently, all around to view where I might be.;kirkpatrick
1;4;421;7;I found I’d reached – and this is true – the edge;kirkpatrick
1;4;422;8;of the abyss, that cavern of grief and pain;kirkpatrick
1;4;423;9;that rings a peal of endless miseries.;kirkpatrick
1;4;424;10;The pit, so dark, so wreathed in cloud, went down;kirkpatrick
1;4;425;11;so far that – peering towards its deepest ﬂoor – I still could;kirkpatrick
1;4;426;12;not discern a single thing.;kirkpatrick
1;4;427;13;‘Let us descend,’ the poet now began,;kirkpatrick
1;4;428;14;‘and enter this blind world.’ His face was pale.;kirkpatrick
1;4;429;15;‘I shall go ﬁrst. Then you come close behind.’;kirkpatrick
1;4;430;16;I was aware of his altered colour.;kirkpatrick
1;4;431;17;‘How can I come, when you,’ I said, ‘my strength in every;kirkpatrick
1;4;432;18;time of doubt, are terriﬁed?’;kirkpatrick
1;4;433;19;‘It is the agony,’ he answered me,;kirkpatrick
1;4;434;20;‘of those below that paints my features thus –;kirkpatrick
1;4;435;21;not fear, as you suppose it is, but pity.;kirkpatrick
1;4;436;22;Let us go on. The long road spurs our pace.’;kirkpatrick
1;4;437;23;So now he set himself – and me as well –;kirkpatrick
1;4;438;24;to enter Circle One, which skirts the emptiness.;kirkpatrick
1;4;439;25;Here in the dark (where only hearing told);kirkpatrick
1;4;440;26;there were no tears, no weeping, only sighs;kirkpatrick
1;4;441;27;that caused a trembling in the eternal air –;kirkpatrick
1;4;442;28;sighs drawn from sorrowing, although no pain.;kirkpatrick
1;4;443;29;This weighs on all of them, those multitudes;kirkpatrick
1;4;444;30;of speechless children, women and full-grown men.;kirkpatrick
1;4;445;31;‘You do not ask,’ my teacher in his goodness said,;kirkpatrick
1;4;446;32;‘who all these spirits are that you see here?;kirkpatrick
1;4;447;33;Do not, I mean, go further till you know:;kirkpatrick
1;4;448;34;these never sinned. And some attained to merit.;kirkpatrick
1;4;449;35;But merit falls far short. None was baptized.;kirkpatrick
1;4;450;36;None passed the gate, in your belief, to faith.;kirkpatrick
1;4;451;37;They lived before the Christian age began.;kirkpatrick
1;4;452;38;They paid no reverence, as was due to God.;kirkpatrick
1;4;453;39;And in this number I myself am one.;kirkpatrick
1;4;454;40;For such deﬁciencies, no other crime,;kirkpatrick
1;4;455;41;we all are lost yet only suﬀer harm;kirkpatrick
1;4;456;42;through living in desire, but hopelessly.’;kirkpatrick
1;4;457;43;At hearing this, great sorrow gripped my heart.;kirkpatrick
1;4;458;44;For many persons of the greatest worth;kirkpatrick
1;4;459;45;were held, I knew, suspended on this strip.;kirkpatrick
1;4;460;46;‘Tell me, sir, tell me, my dearest teacher,’;kirkpatrick
1;4;461;47;so I began, determined – on a point;kirkpatrick
1;4;462;48;of faith, which routs all error – to be sure,;kirkpatrick
1;4;463;49;‘has anyone, by merit of his own;kirkpatrick
1;4;464;50;or else another’s, left here then been blessed?’;kirkpatrick
1;4;465;51;And he, who read the sense my words had hid,;kirkpatrick
1;4;466;52;answered: ‘I still was new to this strange state;kirkpatrick
1;4;467;53;when, now advancing, I beheld a power;kirkpatrick
1;4;468;54;whose head was crowned with signs of victory.;kirkpatrick
1;4;469;55;He led away the shadow of our primal sire,;kirkpatrick
1;4;470;56;shades of his oﬀspring, Abel and Noah,;kirkpatrick
1;4;471;57;Moses, who uttered (and observed) the law,;kirkpatrick
1;4;472;58;of Abraham the patriarch, David the king,;kirkpatrick
1;4;473;59;Israel, his father and his own twelve sons,;kirkpatrick
1;4;474;60;with Rachel, too, for whom he laboured long,;kirkpatrick
1;4;475;61;and many more besides. All these He blessed.;kirkpatrick
1;4;476;62;This too I mean you’ll know: until these were,;kirkpatrick
1;4;477;63;no human soul had ever been redeemed.’;kirkpatrick
1;4;478;64;Speak as he might, our journey did not pause,;kirkpatrick
1;4;479;65;but on we went, and onward, through the wood –;kirkpatrick
1;4;480;66;the wood, I mean, of spirits thronging round.;kirkpatrick
1;4;481;67;Our steps were still not far from where, in sleep,;kirkpatrick
1;4;482;68;I fell, when now, ahead, I saw a ﬁre;kirkpatrick
1;4;483;69;that overcame a hemisphere of shade.;kirkpatrick
1;4;484;70;From this we were, as yet, some paces oﬀ,;kirkpatrick
1;4;485;71;but not so far that I should fail to see;kirkpatrick
1;4;486;72;that men of honour made this place their own.;kirkpatrick
1;4;487;73;‘Honour you bring, my lord, to art and learning.;kirkpatrick
1;4;488;74;Inform me who these are – their honour great –;kirkpatrick
1;4;489;75;who stand apart in some way from the rest.’;kirkpatrick
1;4;490;76;He answered me: ‘The honour of their name;kirkpatrick
1;4;491;77;rings clear for those, like you, who live above, and here;kirkpatrick
1;4;492;78;gains favour out of Heaven’s grace.’;kirkpatrick
1;4;493;79;And then there came upon my ear a voice:;kirkpatrick
1;4;494;80;‘Honour be his, the poet in the heights.;kirkpatrick
1;4;495;81;His shadow now returns which had departed.’;kirkpatrick
1;4;496;82;The voice was still and silent once again.;kirkpatrick
1;4;497;83;And now, I saw, there came four noble shades,;kirkpatrick
1;4;498;84;no sorrow in their countenance, nor joy.;kirkpatrick
1;4;499;85;My teacher – that good man – began to speak:;kirkpatrick
1;4;500;86;‘Look on. Behold the one who, sword in hand,;kirkpatrick
1;4;501;87;precedes, as their true lord, the other three.;kirkpatrick
1;4;502;88;This is that sovereign Homer, poet.;kirkpatrick
1;4;503;89;Horace the satirist is next to come,;kirkpatrick
1;4;504;90;Ovid is third. Then (see!) there is Lucan.;kirkpatrick
1;4;505;91;All these, by right, must duly share with me;kirkpatrick
1;4;506;92;the name that sounded in that single voice.;kirkpatrick
1;4;507;93;They do me honour thus, and thus do well.’;kirkpatrick
1;4;508;94;And so I saw, assembling there as one,;kirkpatrick
1;4;509;95;the lovely college of that lord of song;kirkpatrick
1;4;510;96;whose verses soar like eagles over all.;kirkpatrick
1;4;511;97;Some little time they talked among themselves,;kirkpatrick
1;4;512;98;then turned to me and oﬀered signs of greeting.;kirkpatrick
1;4;513;99;On seeing all of this, my teacher smiled.;kirkpatrick
1;4;514;100;And greater honour still they paid me now:;kirkpatrick
1;4;515;101;they summoned me to join them in their ranks.;kirkpatrick
1;4;516;102;I came and walked as sixth among such wisdom.;kirkpatrick
1;4;517;103;So on we went to reach the dome of light;kirkpatrick
1;4;518;104;and spoke of things which, proper where I was,;kirkpatrick
1;4;519;105;are relegated, rightly, here to silence.;kirkpatrick
1;4;520;106;We reached the footings of a noble fort,;kirkpatrick
1;4;521;107;circled around by seven curtain walls;kirkpatrick
1;4;522;108;and also, as its moat, a lovely stream.;kirkpatrick
1;4;523;109;We passed this brook as though it were dry land.;kirkpatrick
1;4;524;110;Through seven gates I went with these ﬁve sages.;kirkpatrick
1;4;525;111;We then came out upon a verdant lawn.;kirkpatrick
1;4;526;112;Here there were some whose eyes were ﬁrm and grave;kirkpatrick
1;4;527;113;–;kirkpatrick
1;4;528;114;all, in demeanour, of authority –;kirkpatrick
1;4;529;115;"who seldom spoke; their tones were calm and gentle.";kirkpatrick
1;4;530;116;And so we drew aside and found a space,;kirkpatrick
1;4;531;117;illuminated, open, high and airy,;kirkpatrick
1;4;532;118;where all of these were able to be seen.;kirkpatrick
1;4;533;119;And there, across that bright enamelled green,;kirkpatrick
1;4;534;120;these ancient heroes were displayed to me.;kirkpatrick
1;4;535;121;And I within myself am still raised high;kirkpatrick
1;4;536;122;at what I saw: Electra, many round her.;kirkpatrick
1;4;537;123;Hector I recognized, Aeneas, too,;kirkpatrick
1;4;538;124;and Caesar in arms, with his hawk-like eyes.;kirkpatrick
1;4;539;125;Camilla I saw and Penthesilea,;kirkpatrick
1;4;540;126;and King Latinus on the other side –;kirkpatrick
1;4;541;127;his daughter seated with him, his Lavinia.;kirkpatrick
1;4;542;128;Brutus (he drove proud Tarquin out), Lucrece;kirkpatrick
1;4;543;129;and Julia, Marcia, Cornelia – all these I saw,;kirkpatrick
1;4;544;130;and there alone, apart, the sultan Saladin.;kirkpatrick
1;4;545;131;And then – my brow raised higher still – I saw,;kirkpatrick
1;4;546;132;among his family of philosophers,;kirkpatrick
1;4;547;133;the master of all those who think and know.;kirkpatrick
1;4;548;134;To him all look in wonder, all in honour.;kirkpatrick
1;4;549;135;And, closer to his side than all the rest,;kirkpatrick
1;4;550;136;I now saw Socrates, I saw now Plato,;kirkpatrick
1;4;551;137;and one, Democritus, who claims the world is chance,;kirkpatrick
1;4;552;138;Diogenes and Tales, Anaxagoras,;kirkpatrick
1;4;553;139;Empedocles, Heraclitus and Zeno.;kirkpatrick
1;4;554;140;Then one I saw who gathered healing herbs –;kirkpatrick
1;4;555;141;I mean good Dioscorides. Orpheus I saw,;kirkpatrick
1;4;556;142;and Seneca the moralist, Linus, Tully,;kirkpatrick
1;4;557;143;Euclid (geometer) and Ptolemy,;kirkpatrick
1;4;558;144;Hippocrates, Avicenna and Galen,;kirkpatrick
1;4;559;145;Averroes, too, who made the Commentary.;kirkpatrick
1;4;560;146;"I cannot here draw portraits of them all;";kirkpatrick
1;4;561;147;my lengthy subject presses me ahead,;kirkpatrick
1;4;562;148;and saying often falls far short of fact.;kirkpatrick
1;4;563;149;That company of six declines to two.;kirkpatrick
1;4;564;150;My lord in wisdom leads a diﬀerent way,;kirkpatrick
1;4;565;151;out of that quiet into trembling air.;kirkpatrick
1;4;566;152;And nothing, where I now arrive, is shining.;kirkpatrick
1;5;567;1;And so from Circle One I now went down;kirkpatrick
1;5;568;2;deeper, to Circle Two, which bounds a lesser space and;kirkpatrick
1;5;569;3;therefore greater suﬀering. Its sting is misery.;kirkpatrick
1;5;570;4;Minos stands there – horribly there – and barking.;kirkpatrick
1;5;571;5;He, on the threshold, checks degrees of guilt,;kirkpatrick
1;5;572;6;then judges and dispatches with his twirling tail.;kirkpatrick
1;5;573;7;I mean that every ill-begotten creature,;kirkpatrick
1;5;574;8;when summoned here, confesses everything.;kirkpatrick
1;5;575;9;And he (his sense of sin is very ﬁne);kirkpatrick
1;5;576;10;perceives what place in Hell best suits each one,;kirkpatrick
1;5;577;11;and coils his tail around himself to tell;kirkpatrick
1;5;578;12;the numbered ring to which he’ll send them down.;kirkpatrick
1;5;579;13;Before him, always, stands a crowd of souls.;kirkpatrick
1;5;580;14;By turns they go, each one, for sentencing.;kirkpatrick
1;5;581;15;Each pleads, attends – and then is tipped below.;kirkpatrick
1;5;582;16;‘You there, arriving at this house of woe,’;kirkpatrick
1;5;583;17;so, when he saw me there, the judge spoke forth, (to;kirkpatrick
1;5;584;18;interrupt a while his formal role),;kirkpatrick
1;5;585;19;‘watch as you enter – and in whom you trust.;kirkpatrick
1;5;586;20;Don’t let yourself be fooled by this wide threshold.’;kirkpatrick
1;5;587;21;My leader’s thrust: ‘This yelling! Why persist?;kirkpatrick
1;5;588;22;Do not impede him on his destined way.;kirkpatrick
1;5;589;23;For this is willed where all is possible;kirkpatrick
1;5;590;24;that is willed there. And so demand no more.’;kirkpatrick
1;5;591;25;But now the tones of pain, continuing,;kirkpatrick
1;5;592;26;demand I hear them out. And now I’ve come;kirkpatrick
1;5;593;27;where grief and weeping pierce me at the heart.;kirkpatrick
1;5;594;28;And so I came where light is mute, a place;kirkpatrick
1;5;595;29;that moans as oceans do impelled by storms,;kirkpatrick
1;5;596;30;surging, embattled in conﬂicting squalls.;kirkpatrick
1;5;597;31;The swirling wind of Hell will never rest.;kirkpatrick
1;5;598;32;It drags these spirits onwards in its force.;kirkpatrick
1;5;599;33;It chafes them – rolling, clashing – grievously.;kirkpatrick
1;5;600;34;Then, once they reach the point from which they fell…;kirkpatrick
1;5;601;35;screams, keening cries, the agony of all,;kirkpatrick
1;5;602;36;and all blaspheming at the Holy Power.;kirkpatrick
1;5;603;37;Caught in this torment, as I understood,;kirkpatrick
1;5;604;38;were those who – here condemned for carnal sin – made;kirkpatrick
1;5;605;39;reason bow to their instinctual bent.;kirkpatrick
1;5;606;40;As starlings on the wing in winter chills;kirkpatrick
1;5;607;41;are borne along in wide and teeming ﬂocks,;kirkpatrick
1;5;608;42;so on these breathing gusts the evil souls.;kirkpatrick
1;5;609;43;This way and that and up and down they’re borne.;kirkpatrick
1;5;610;44;Here is no hope of any comfort ever,;kirkpatrick
1;5;611;45;neither of respite nor of lesser pain.;kirkpatrick
1;5;612;46;And now, as cranes go singing lamentations;kirkpatrick
1;5;613;47;and form themselves through air in long-drawn lines,;kirkpatrick
1;5;614;48;coming towards me, trailing all their sorrows,;kirkpatrick
1;5;615;49;I saw new shadows lifted by this force.;kirkpatrick
1;5;616;50;‘Who are these people? Tell me, sir,’ I said,;kirkpatrick
1;5;617;51;‘why black air scourges them so viciously.’;kirkpatrick
1;5;618;52;‘The ﬁrst of those whose tale you wish to hear,’;kirkpatrick
1;5;619;53;he answered me without a moment’s pause,;kirkpatrick
1;5;620;54;‘governed as empress over diverse tongues.;kirkpatrick
1;5;621;55;She was so wracked by lust and luxury,;kirkpatrick
1;5;622;56;licentiousness was legal under laws she made –;kirkpatrick
1;5;623;57;to lift the blame that she herself incurred.;kirkpatrick
1;5;624;58;This is Semiramis. Of her one reads;kirkpatrick
1;5;625;59;that she, though heir to Ninus, was his bride.;kirkpatrick
1;5;626;60;Her lands were those where now the Sultan reigns.;kirkpatrick
1;5;627;61;The other, lovelorn, slew herself and broke;kirkpatrick
1;5;628;62;her vow of faith to Sichaeus’s ashes.;kirkpatrick
1;5;629;63;And next, so lascivious, Cleopatra.;kirkpatrick
1;5;630;64;Helen. You see? Because of her, a wretched;kirkpatrick
1;5;631;65;waste of years went by. See! Great Achilles.;kirkpatrick
1;5;632;66;He fought with love until his ﬁnal day.;kirkpatrick
1;5;633;67;Paris you see, and Tristan there.’ And more;kirkpatrick
1;5;634;68;than a thousand shadows he numbered, naming;kirkpatrick
1;5;635;69;them all, whom Love had led to leave our life.;kirkpatrick
1;5;636;70;Hearing that man of learning herald thus;kirkpatrick
1;5;637;71;these chevaliers of old, and noble ladies,;kirkpatrick
1;5;638;72;pity oppressed me and I was all but lost.;kirkpatrick
1;5;639;73;‘How willingly,’ I turned towards the poet,;kirkpatrick
1;5;640;74;‘I’d speak to those two there who go conjoined;kirkpatrick
1;5;641;75;and look to be so light upon the wind.’;kirkpatrick
1;5;642;76;And he to me: ‘You’ll see them clearer soon.;kirkpatrick
1;5;643;77;When they are closer, call to them. Invoke;kirkpatrick
1;5;644;78;the love that draws them on, and they will come.’;kirkpatrick
1;5;645;79;The wind had swept them nearer to us now.;kirkpatrick
1;5;646;80;I moved to them in words: ‘Soul-wearied creatures!;kirkpatrick
1;5;647;81;Come, if none forbids, to us and, breathless, speak.’;kirkpatrick
1;5;648;82;As doves, when called by their desires, will come –;kirkpatrick
1;5;649;83;wings spreading high – to settle on their nest,;kirkpatrick
1;5;650;84;borne through the air by their own steady will,;kirkpatrick
1;5;651;85;so these two left the ﬂock where Dido is.;kirkpatrick
1;5;652;86;They came, approaching through malignant air,;kirkpatrick
1;5;653;87;so strong for them had been my feeling cry.;kirkpatrick
1;5;654;88;‘Our fellow being, gracious, kind and good!;kirkpatrick
1;5;655;89;You, on your journeying through this bruised air, here visit;kirkpatrick
1;5;656;90;two who tinged the world with blood.;kirkpatrick
1;5;657;91;Suppose the Sovereign of the Universe;kirkpatrick
1;5;658;92;were still our friend, we’d pray He grant you peace.;kirkpatrick
1;5;659;93;You pity so the ill perverting us.;kirkpatrick
1;5;660;94;Whatever you may please to hear or say,;kirkpatrick
1;5;661;95;we, as we hear, we, as we speak, assent,;kirkpatrick
1;5;662;96;so long – as now they do – these winds stay silent.;kirkpatrick
1;5;663;97;My native place is set along those shores;kirkpatrick
1;5;664;98;through which the river Po comes down, to be;kirkpatrick
1;5;665;99;at last at peace with all its tributaries.;kirkpatrick
1;5;666;100;Love, who so fast brings ﬂame to generous hearts,;kirkpatrick
1;5;667;101;seized him with feeling for the lovely form,;kirkpatrick
1;5;668;102;now torn from me. The harm of how still rankles.;kirkpatrick
1;5;669;103;Love, who no loved one pardons love’s requite,;kirkpatrick
1;5;670;104;seized me for him so strongly in delight;kirkpatrick
1;5;671;105;that, as you see, he does not leave me yet.;kirkpatrick
1;5;672;106;Love drew us onwards to consuming death.;kirkpatrick
1;5;673;107;Cain’s ice awaits the one who quenched our lives.’;kirkpatrick
1;5;674;108;These words, borne on to us from them, were theirs.;kirkpatrick
1;5;675;109;And when I heard these spirits in distress,;kirkpatrick
1;5;676;110;I bowed my eyes and held them low, until,;kirkpatrick
1;5;677;111;at length, the poet said: ‘What thoughts are these?’;kirkpatrick
1;5;678;112;I, answering in the end, began: ‘Alas,;kirkpatrick
1;5;679;113;how many yearning thoughts, what great desire,;kirkpatrick
1;5;680;114;have led them through such sorrow to their fate?’;kirkpatrick
1;5;681;115;And turning to them now I came to say:;kirkpatrick
1;5;682;116;‘Francesca, how your suﬀering saddens me!;kirkpatrick
1;5;683;117;Sheer pity brings me to the point of tears.;kirkpatrick
1;5;684;118;But tell me this: the how of it – and why –;kirkpatrick
1;5;685;119;that Love, in sweetness of such sighing hours,;kirkpatrick
1;5;686;120;permitted you to know these doubtful pangs.’;kirkpatrick
1;5;687;121;To me she said: ‘There is no sorrow greater;kirkpatrick
1;5;688;122;than, in times of misery, to hold at heart;kirkpatrick
1;5;689;123;the memory of happiness. (Your teacher knows.);kirkpatrick
1;5;690;124;And yet, if you so deeply yearn to trace;kirkpatrick
1;5;691;125;the root from which the love we share ﬁrst sprang, then I;kirkpatrick
1;5;692;126;shall say – and speak as though in tears.;kirkpatrick
1;5;693;127;One day we read together, for pure joy;kirkpatrick
1;5;694;128;how Lancelot was taken in Love’s palm.;kirkpatrick
1;5;695;129;We were alone. We knew no suspicion.;kirkpatrick
1;5;696;130;Time after time, the words we read would lift;kirkpatrick
1;5;697;131;our eyes and drain all colour from our faces.;kirkpatrick
1;5;698;132;A single point, however, vanquished us.;kirkpatrick
1;5;699;133;For when at last we read the longed-for smile;kirkpatrick
1;5;700;134;of Guinevere – at last her lover kissed –;kirkpatrick
1;5;701;135;he, who from me will never now depart,;kirkpatrick
1;5;702;136;touched his kiss, trembling to my open mouth.;kirkpatrick
1;5;703;137;This book was Galehault – pander-penned, the pimp!;kirkpatrick
1;5;704;138;That day we read no further down those lines.’;kirkpatrick
1;5;705;139;And all the while, as one of them spoke on,;kirkpatrick
1;5;706;140;the other wept, and I, in such great pity,;kirkpatrick
1;5;707;141;fainted away as though I were to die.;kirkpatrick
1;5;708;142;And now I fell as bodies fall, for dead.;kirkpatrick
1;6;709;1;As now I came once more to conscious mind –;kirkpatrick
1;6;710;2;closed in those feelings for the kindred souls;kirkpatrick
1;6;711;3;that had, in sudden sadness, overcome me –;kirkpatrick
1;6;712;4;wherever I might turn I saw – wherever;kirkpatrick
1;6;713;5;I might move, look around or settle my gaze –;kirkpatrick
1;6;714;6;new forms of torment, new tormented souls.;kirkpatrick
1;6;715;7;I am in Circle Three. And rain falls there,;kirkpatrick
1;6;716;8;endlessly, chill, accursed and heavy,;kirkpatrick
1;6;717;9;its rate and composition never new.;kirkpatrick
1;6;718;10;Snow, massive hailstones, black, tainted water;kirkpatrick
1;6;719;11;pour down in sheets through tenebrae of air.;kirkpatrick
1;6;720;12;The earth absorbs it all and stinks, revoltingly.;kirkpatrick
1;6;721;13;Cerberus, weird and monstrously cruel,;kirkpatrick
1;6;722;14;barks from his triple throats in cur-like yowls;kirkpatrick
1;6;723;15;over the heads of those who lie there, drowned.;kirkpatrick
1;6;724;16;His eyes vermilion, beard a greasy black,;kirkpatrick
1;6;725;17;his belly broad, his ﬁngers all sharp-nailed,;kirkpatrick
1;6;726;18;he mauls and skins, then hacks in four, these souls.;kirkpatrick
1;6;727;19;From all of them, rain wrings a wet-dog howl.;kirkpatrick
1;6;728;20;They squirm, as ﬂank screens ﬂank. They twist, they turn,;kirkpatrick
1;6;729;21;and then – these vile profanities – they turn again.;kirkpatrick
1;6;730;22;That reptile Cerberus now glimpsed us there.;kirkpatrick
1;6;731;23;"He stretched his jaws; he showed us all his fangs.";kirkpatrick
1;6;732;24;And me? No member in my frame stayed still!;kirkpatrick
1;6;733;25;My leader, bending with his palms wide-spanned,;kirkpatrick
1;6;734;26;scooped dirt in each, and then – his ﬁsts both full – hurled;kirkpatrick
1;6;735;27;these as sops down all three ravening throats.;kirkpatrick
1;6;736;28;A hungry mongrel – yapping, thrusting out,;kirkpatrick
1;6;737;29;intent on nothing but the meal to come –;kirkpatrick
1;6;738;30;is silent only when its teeth sink in.;kirkpatrick
1;6;739;31;In that same way, with three repulsive muzzles,;kirkpatrick
1;6;740;32;the demon Cerberus. His thunderous growlings;kirkpatrick
1;6;741;33;stunned these souls. They wished themselves stone deaf.;kirkpatrick
1;6;742;34;Over such shadows, ﬂat in that hard rain,;kirkpatrick
1;6;743;35;we travelled onwards still. Our tread now fell;kirkpatrick
1;6;744;36;on voided nothings only seeming men.;kirkpatrick
1;6;745;37;Across the whole terrain these shades were spread,;kirkpatrick
1;6;746;38;except that one, at seeing us pass by,;kirkpatrick
1;6;747;39;sat, on the sudden, upright and then cried:;kirkpatrick
1;6;748;40;‘You there! Drawn onwards through this stretch of Hell,;kirkpatrick
1;6;749;41;tell me you know me. Say so, if so you can.;kirkpatrick
1;6;750;42;You! Made as man before myself unmade.’;kirkpatrick
1;6;751;43;And I replied: ‘The awful pain you feel;kirkpatrick
1;6;752;44;perhaps has cancelled you from memory.;kirkpatrick
1;6;753;45;Till now, it seems, I’ve never even seen you.;kirkpatrick
1;6;754;46;Then tell me who you are, and why you dwell;kirkpatrick
1;6;755;47;in such a place? And why a pain like this?;kirkpatrick
1;6;756;48;Others may well be worse, none so disgusting.’;kirkpatrick
1;6;757;49;And he: ‘That burgh of yours – that sack of bile;kirkpatrick
1;6;758;50;that brims by now to overﬂow – I lived;kirkpatrick
1;6;759;51;as hers throughout my own ﬁne-weather years.;kirkpatrick
1;6;760;52;You knew me, like your city friends, as Hoggo.;kirkpatrick
1;6;761;53;So here I am, condemned for gullet sins,;kirkpatrick
1;6;762;54;lying, you see, squashed ﬂat by battering rain.;kirkpatrick
1;6;763;55;I’m not alone in misery of soul.;kirkpatrick
1;6;764;56;These all lie subject to the self-same pain.;kirkpatrick
1;6;765;57;Their guilt is mine.’ He spoke no further word.;kirkpatrick
1;6;766;58;‘Hoggo, your heavy labours,’ I replied,;kirkpatrick
1;6;767;59;‘weigh on me hard and prompt my heavy tears.;kirkpatrick
1;6;768;60;But tell me, if you can, where they’ll all end,;kirkpatrick
1;6;769;61;the citizens of that divided town?;kirkpatrick
1;6;770;62;Is there among them any honest man?;kirkpatrick
1;6;771;63;Why is that place assailed by so much strife?’;kirkpatrick
1;6;772;64;His answer was: ‘From each side, long harangues.;kirkpatrick
1;6;773;65;And then to blood. The Wildwood boys;kirkpatrick
1;6;774;66;will drive the others out. They’ll do great harm.;kirkpatrick
1;6;775;67;But then, within the span of three brief suns,;kirkpatrick
1;6;776;68;that side will fall and others rise and thrive,;kirkpatrick
1;6;777;69;spurred on by one who now just coasts between.;kirkpatrick
1;6;778;70;For quite some time they’ll hold their heads up high;kirkpatrick
1;6;779;71;and grind the others under heavy weights,;kirkpatrick
1;6;780;72;however much, for shame, these weep and writhe.;kirkpatrick
1;6;781;73;Of this lot, two are honest yet not heard.;kirkpatrick
1;6;782;74;For pride and avarice and envy are;kirkpatrick
1;6;783;75;the three ﬁerce sparks that set all hearts ablaze.’;kirkpatrick
1;6;784;76;With this, his tear-drenched song now reached an end.;kirkpatrick
1;6;785;77;But I to him: ‘I still want more instruction.;kirkpatrick
1;6;786;78;This gift I ask of you: please do say more.;kirkpatrick
1;6;787;79;Tegghiaio, Farinata – men of rank –;kirkpatrick
1;6;788;80;Mosca, Arrigo, Rusticucci, too,;kirkpatrick
1;6;789;81;and others with their minds on noble deeds,;kirkpatrick
1;6;790;82;tell me, so I may know them, where they are.;kirkpatrick
1;6;791;83;For I am gripped by great desire, to tell;kirkpatrick
1;6;792;84;if Heaven holds them sweet – or poisonous Hell.’;kirkpatrick
1;6;793;85;And he: ‘These dwell among the blackest souls,;kirkpatrick
1;6;794;86;loaded down deep by sins of diﬀering types.;kirkpatrick
1;6;795;87;If you sink far enough, you’ll see them all.;kirkpatrick
1;6;796;88;But when you walk once more where life is sweet,;kirkpatrick
1;6;797;89;bring me, I beg, to others in remembrance.;kirkpatrick
1;6;798;90;No more I’ll say, nor answer any more.’;kirkpatrick
1;6;799;91;His forward gaze now twisted to a squint.;kirkpatrick
1;6;800;92;He stared at me a little, bent his head,;kirkpatrick
1;6;801;93;then fell face down and joined his fellow blind.;kirkpatrick
1;6;802;94;My leader now addressed me: ‘He’ll not stir;kirkpatrick
1;6;803;95;until the trumpets of the angels sound,;kirkpatrick
1;6;804;96;at which his enemy, True Power, will come.;kirkpatrick
1;6;805;97;Then each will see once more his own sad tomb,;kirkpatrick
1;6;806;98;and each, once more, assume its ﬂesh and ﬁgure,;kirkpatrick
1;6;807;99;each hear the rumbling thunder roll for ever.’;kirkpatrick
1;6;808;100;So on we fared across that ﬁlthy blend;kirkpatrick
1;6;809;101;of rain and shadow spirit, slow in step,;kirkpatrick
1;6;810;102;touching a little on the life to come.;kirkpatrick
1;6;811;103;Concerning which, ‘These torments, sir,’ I said,;kirkpatrick
1;6;812;104;‘when judgement has been ﬁnally proclaimed –;kirkpatrick
1;6;813;105;will these increase or simmer just the same?’;kirkpatrick
1;6;814;106;‘Return,’ he said, ‘to your ﬁrst principles:;kirkpatrick
1;6;815;107;when anything (these state) becomes more perfect,;kirkpatrick
1;6;816;108;then all the more it feels both good and pain.;kirkpatrick
1;6;817;109;Albeit these accursed men will not;kirkpatrick
1;6;818;110;achieve perfection full and true, they still,;kirkpatrick
1;6;819;111;beyond that Day, will come to sharper life.’;kirkpatrick
1;6;820;112;So, circling on the curve around that path,;kirkpatrick
1;6;821;113;we talked of more than I shall here relate,;kirkpatrick
1;6;822;114;but reached the brow, from which the route descends,;kirkpatrick
1;6;823;115;and found there Plutus, the tremendous foe.;kirkpatrick
1;7;824;1;‘Popoi Satan, popoi Satan! Alezorul!’;kirkpatrick
1;7;825;2;So Plutus – shrill voice clucking on – began.;kirkpatrick
1;7;826;3;But Virgil, wise and noble, knowing all,;kirkpatrick
1;7;827;4;spoke out, to comfort me: ‘Let not your fears;kirkpatrick
1;7;828;5;occasion you distress. Despite his powers,;kirkpatrick
1;7;829;6;he cannot steal your right to scale this rock face.’;kirkpatrick
1;7;830;7;And then he turned to meet those rabid lips.;kirkpatrick
1;7;831;8;‘Silence, you execrable wolf!’ he said.;kirkpatrick
1;7;832;9;‘May fury gnaw you inwardly away.;kirkpatrick
1;7;833;10;To these dark depths, with every right he treads.;kirkpatrick
1;7;834;11;All this is willed where Michael, in the heights,;kirkpatrick
1;7;835;12;avenged the rapine wrought by prideful hordes.’;kirkpatrick
1;7;836;13;As sails, inﬂated by a furious wind,;kirkpatrick
1;7;837;14;fall in a tangle when the main mast snaps,;kirkpatrick
1;7;838;15;so too he ﬂopped, this predator, to ground.;kirkpatrick
1;7;839;16;Then downwards to the seventh sink we went,;kirkpatrick
1;7;840;17;advancing further down the curving wall;kirkpatrick
1;7;841;18;that bags up all the evil of the universe.;kirkpatrick
1;7;842;19;God in all justice! I saw there so many;kirkpatrick
1;7;843;20;new forms of travail, so tightly crammed. By whom?;kirkpatrick
1;7;844;21;How can our guilt so rend and ruin us?;kirkpatrick
1;7;845;22;Over Charybdis, the sea surge swirls;kirkpatrick
1;7;846;23;and shatters on the swell it clashes with.;kirkpatrick
1;7;847;24;So must these people dance their morisco.;kirkpatrick
1;7;848;25;I saw, in numbers greater than elsewhere,;kirkpatrick
1;7;849;26;two factions, hollering, this one to that,;kirkpatrick
1;7;850;27;who rolled great boulders, thrust by rib and tit.;kirkpatrick
1;7;851;28;Their stones would clash. Then wheeling they’d retreat;kirkpatrick
1;7;852;29;and yell, across their shoulders, cry and counter-cry.;kirkpatrick
1;7;853;30;‘You miser! Why?’ ‘Why ﬂing it all away?’;kirkpatrick
1;7;854;31;So back along that dismal curve they went,;kirkpatrick
1;7;855;32;to reach, at either end, the diametric points,;kirkpatrick
1;7;856;33;still screaming shamefully insulting chants.;kirkpatrick
1;7;857;34;Arriving – each round his half-circle – back,;kirkpatrick
1;7;858;35;each whisked around to tilt against the next other.;kirkpatrick
1;7;859;36;At this – my heart transﬁxed, or very nearly:;kirkpatrick
1;7;860;37;‘Sir,’ I spoke up, ‘make clear to me what folk;kirkpatrick
1;7;861;38;these are, and whether – to our left – all those;kirkpatrick
1;7;862;39;with tonsured scalps could really have been clerics.’;kirkpatrick
1;7;863;40;‘Without exception, all of these,’ he said,;kirkpatrick
1;7;864;41;‘when ﬁrst they lived, had such strabismic minds;kirkpatrick
1;7;865;42;they’d bear no check or measure on expense.;kirkpatrick
1;7;866;43;And when they reach the two points in the round;kirkpatrick
1;7;867;44;where converse crimes uncouple each from each,;kirkpatrick
1;7;868;45;they bark their meaning out and sound it clear.;kirkpatrick
1;7;869;46;Clerics they were – all those whose heads aren’t dressed;kirkpatrick
1;7;870;47;with shaggy hair. All popes – or cardinals.;kirkpatrick
1;7;871;48;In that lot, avarice displays its worst.’;kirkpatrick
1;7;872;49;‘Well, sir,’ I said, ‘in any group like this,;kirkpatrick
1;7;873;50;I surely ought to recognize some few;kirkpatrick
1;7;874;51;who bore in life the taint of this disease.’;kirkpatrick
1;7;875;52;‘You seek,’ he said, ‘to form an idle thought.;kirkpatrick
1;7;876;53;The mindless lives that made them all so foul;kirkpatrick
1;7;877;54;darken them now against all acts of mind.;kirkpatrick
1;7;878;55;Both, to eternity, will buck and butt.;kirkpatrick
1;7;879;56;These from their tombs will rise with ﬁsts tight shut, the;kirkpatrick
1;7;880;57;others with their curly manes cropped short.;kirkpatrick
1;7;881;58;Their frenzied sprees or febrile hoardings-up;kirkpatrick
1;7;882;59;have wrung from them the beauty of the world,;kirkpatrick
1;7;883;60;and brought them ﬁrmly to this ugly brawl.;kirkpatrick
1;7;884;61;You now can see, dear son, the short-lived pranks;kirkpatrick
1;7;885;62;that goods consigned to Fortune’s hand will play,;kirkpatrick
1;7;886;63;causing such squabbles in the human ranks.;kirkpatrick
1;7;887;64;For all the gold that lies beneath the moon –;kirkpatrick
1;7;888;65;or all that ever did lie there – would bring;kirkpatrick
1;7;889;66;no respite to these worn-out souls, not one.’;kirkpatrick
1;7;890;67;‘Please tell me, sir,’ I said, a little more,;kirkpatrick
1;7;891;68;‘what can it be, this Fortune that you touch on,;kirkpatrick
1;7;892;69;that clasps all earthly goods between its claws?’;kirkpatrick
1;7;893;70;And he to me: ‘You idiotic creatures,;kirkpatrick
1;7;894;71;so greatly hurt by your own ignorance!;kirkpatrick
1;7;895;72;Feed on my words. I’d have you grasp their sense.;kirkpatrick
1;7;896;73;He who transcends in wisdom all that is,;kirkpatrick
1;7;897;74;wrought every sphere and gave to each a guide,;kirkpatrick
1;7;898;75;so every part shines out to every part;kirkpatrick
1;7;899;76;always in equal distribution of light.;kirkpatrick
1;7;900;77;So, too, above the splendours of the world,;kirkpatrick
1;7;901;78;He set a sovereign minister, ordained to move –;kirkpatrick
1;7;902;79;in permutations at the proper time –;kirkpatrick
1;7;903;80;vain goods from tribe to tribe, from blood to blood, in;kirkpatrick
1;7;904;81;ways from which no human wisdom hides.;kirkpatrick
1;7;905;82;And this is why, where one race rules supreme,;kirkpatrick
1;7;906;83;another faints and languishes: they all pursue;kirkpatrick
1;7;907;84;her judgements, secret as a snake in grass.;kirkpatrick
1;7;908;85;Your powers of mind cannot contend with her.;kirkpatrick
1;7;909;86;She, looking forwards, will pronounce her law,;kirkpatrick
1;7;910;87;advancing, as do other gods, her own domain.;kirkpatrick
1;7;911;88;Her permutations never come to rest.;kirkpatrick
1;7;912;89;It is necessity that makes her quick,;kirkpatrick
1;7;913;90;so thick they come by turns to meet their fate.;kirkpatrick
1;7;914;91;She is the one so often crossed and cursed;kirkpatrick
1;7;915;92;by those who, rightly, ought to sing her praise,;kirkpatrick
1;7;916;93;yet vilify her name and speak her ill.;kirkpatrick
1;7;917;94;But she, a holy being, pays no heed.;kirkpatrick
1;7;918;95;Happy, with all the other primal powers,;kirkpatrick
1;7;919;96;she turns her sphere, rejoicing in beatitude.;kirkpatrick
1;7;920;97;So let us now go down to greater pain.;kirkpatrick
1;7;921;98;The stars that rose when I ﬁrst stirred now fall.;kirkpatrick
1;7;922;99;We cannot stay too long. That is forbidden.’;kirkpatrick
1;7;923;100;Cutting across the circle, we approached;kirkpatrick
1;7;924;101;the margins of a spring – which, seething, spilled;kirkpatrick
1;7;925;102;and ran from there along an outer sluice.;kirkpatrick
1;7;926;103;The waters here were darker, far, than perse.;kirkpatrick
1;7;927;104;So, on – accompanied by murky waves –;kirkpatrick
1;7;928;105;downwards we travelled by a weirder route.;kirkpatrick
1;7;929;106;Into a swamp (by name, the loathsome Styx);kirkpatrick
1;7;930;107;this melancholy brook makes way, and ﬁnds;kirkpatrick
1;7;931;108;the foot of those malignant, grey-black slopes.;kirkpatrick
1;7;932;109;As there I stood, intent and wondering,;kirkpatrick
1;7;933;110;I saw there, plunged within that stagnant fen,;kirkpatrick
1;7;934;111;a peevish people, naked, caked with mud.;kirkpatrick
1;7;935;112;Each battered each – and not with ﬁsts alone,;kirkpatrick
1;7;936;113;also with head butts, kicks and charging chests.;kirkpatrick
1;7;937;114;Their teeth, too, tore them, bit by bit, to shreds.;kirkpatrick
1;7;938;115;‘You witness now,’ my gentle teacher said,;kirkpatrick
1;7;939;116;‘the souls of those whom anger overthrew.;kirkpatrick
1;7;940;117;And this I’d also have you know: be sure,;kirkpatrick
1;7;941;118;beneath the surface of this slick are some;kirkpatrick
1;7;942;119;whose sighs – as you can see at every turn –;kirkpatrick
1;7;943;120;now aerate that pullulating ﬁlm.;kirkpatrick
1;7;944;121;So, stuck there fast in slime, they hum: “Mournful;kirkpatrick
1;7;945;122;we were. Sunlight rejoices the balmy air.;kirkpatrick
1;7;946;123;We, though, within ourselves nursed sullen fumes,;kirkpatrick
1;7;947;124;and come to misery in this black ooze.”;kirkpatrick
1;7;948;125;That is the hymn each gurgles in his gorge,;kirkpatrick
1;7;949;126;unable to articulate a single phrase.’;kirkpatrick
1;7;950;127;So, on around this sour, revolting pit,;kirkpatrick
1;7;951;128;between the sludge and arid rock, we swung;kirkpatrick
1;7;952;129;our arc, eyes bent on those who gulped that slop.;kirkpatrick
1;7;953;130;We reached, in ﬁne, the bottom of a tower.;kirkpatrick
1;8;954;1;And so I say (continuing) that, long before;kirkpatrick
1;8;955;2;we reached the bottom of that lofty tower,;kirkpatrick
1;8;956;3;our eyes had travelled upwards to its summit,;kirkpatrick
1;8;957;4;drawn by a pair of tiny ﬂames, set there –;kirkpatrick
1;8;958;5;as now we saw – to signal to a third,;kirkpatrick
1;8;959;6;so far away the eye could hardly grasp it.;kirkpatrick
1;8;960;7;I turned towards the ocean of all wisdom:;kirkpatrick
1;8;961;8;‘What do they mean?’ I said to him. ‘What answer does;kirkpatrick
1;8;962;9;the farther ﬁre now give? Who makes these signs?’;kirkpatrick
1;8;963;10;And he: ‘Across these waves of foaming mire,;kirkpatrick
1;8;964;11;you may already glimpse what they’ve been waiting for,;kirkpatrick
1;8;965;12;unless it still goes hidden by these marshy fumes.’;kirkpatrick
1;8;966;13;No bow string ever shot through air an arrow;kirkpatrick
1;8;967;14;rapider than now, at speed, I saw come on;kirkpatrick
1;8;968;15;towards us there, a mean little vessel,;kirkpatrick
1;8;969;16;within it – as pilot plying these waters –;kirkpatrick
1;8;970;17;a single galley man who strained the oar,;kirkpatrick
1;8;971;18;squealing: ‘You ﬁend! You’ve got it coming now!’;kirkpatrick
1;8;972;19;‘Phlegyas, Phlegyas!’ my master said.;kirkpatrick
1;8;973;20;‘Your screams and shouts have, this time, little point.;kirkpatrick
1;8;974;21;We’re yours – but only while we cross this marsh.’;kirkpatrick
1;8;975;22;Like someone hearing that a massive hoax;kirkpatrick
1;8;976;23;has just, to his disgruntlement, been pulled on him, so;kirkpatrick
1;8;977;24;Phlegyas now stood, in pent-up rage.;kirkpatrick
1;8;978;25;My lord stepped down, and, entering the boat,;kirkpatrick
1;8;979;26;he made me, in my turn, embark behind.;kirkpatrick
1;8;980;27;The hull seemed laden only when I did.;kirkpatrick
1;8;981;28;At once – my leader boarded, me as well –;kirkpatrick
1;8;982;29;the ancient prow put out. It sawed the waves;kirkpatrick
1;8;983;30;more deeply than it would with other crews.;kirkpatrick
1;8;984;31;So, rushing forwards on that lifeless slick,;kirkpatrick
1;8;985;32;there jerked up, fronting me, one brimming slime who;kirkpatrick
1;8;986;33;spoke: ‘So who – you come too soon! – are you?’;kirkpatrick
1;8;987;34;"And my riposte: ‘I come, perhaps; I’ll not remain.";kirkpatrick
1;8;988;35;But who might you be, brutishly befouled?’;kirkpatrick
1;8;989;36;His answer was: ‘Just look at me. I’m one;kirkpatrick
1;8;990;37;who weeps.’ And I to him: ‘Weep on. In grief,;kirkpatrick
1;8;991;38;may you remain, you spirit of damnation!;kirkpatrick
1;8;992;39;I know who you are, ﬁlth as you may be.’;kirkpatrick
1;8;993;40;And then he stretched both hands towards our gunwales.;kirkpatrick
1;8;994;41;My teacher, though – alert – soon drove him back, saying:;kirkpatrick
1;8;995;42;‘Get down! Be oﬀ with all that dog pack!’;kirkpatrick
1;8;996;43;And then he ringed both arms around my neck.;kirkpatrick
1;8;997;44;He kissed my face, then said: ‘You wrathful soul!;kirkpatrick
1;8;998;45;Blessed the one that held you in her womb.;kirkpatrick
1;8;999;46;That man, alive, ﬂaunted his arrogance,;kirkpatrick
1;8;1000;47;and nothing good adorns his memory.;kirkpatrick
1;8;1001;48;So here his shadow is possessed with rage.;kirkpatrick
1;8;1002;49;How many, in the world above, pose there;kirkpatrick
1;8;1003;50;as kings but here will lie like pigs in muck,;kirkpatrick
1;8;1004;51;leaving behind them horrible dispraise.’;kirkpatrick
1;8;1005;52;‘Sir,’ I replied, ‘this I should really like:;kirkpatrick
1;8;1006;53;before we make our way beyond this lake,;kirkpatrick
1;8;1007;54;to see him dabbled in the minestrone.’;kirkpatrick
1;8;1008;55;He gave me my answer: ‘Before that shore;kirkpatrick
1;8;1009;56;has come to view, you’ll surely have your ﬁll.;kirkpatrick
1;8;1010;57;And rightly you rejoice in this desire.’;kirkpatrick
1;8;1011;58;Then, moments on, I saw that sinner ripped;kirkpatrick
1;8;1012;59;to vicious tatters by that mud-caked lot.;kirkpatrick
1;8;1013;60;I praise God still, and still give thanks for that.;kirkpatrick
1;8;1014;61;‘Get him,’ they howled. ‘Let’s get him – Silver Phil!’;kirkpatrick
1;8;1015;62;That crazy Florentine! He bucked, he baulked.;kirkpatrick
1;8;1016;63;Turning, the Guelf turned teeth upon himself.;kirkpatrick
1;8;1017;64;We left him there. Of him, my story tells no more.;kirkpatrick
1;8;1018;65;And yet my ears were pierced with cries of pain.;kirkpatrick
1;8;1019;66;At which, I barred my eyes intently forwards.;kirkpatrick
1;8;1020;67;‘Dear son,’ my teacher in his goodness said,;kirkpatrick
1;8;1021;68;‘we now approach the city known as Dis,;kirkpatrick
1;8;1022;69;its teeming crowds and weighty citizens.’;kirkpatrick
1;8;1023;70;‘Already, sir,’ I said, ‘I clearly can;kirkpatrick
1;8;1024;71;make out the minarets beyond this moat,;kirkpatrick
1;8;1025;72;as bright and red, it seems, as if they sprang;kirkpatrick
1;8;1026;73;from ﬁre.’ ‘Eternal ﬁre,’ he answered me,;kirkpatrick
1;8;1027;74;‘burning within, projects, as you can see,;kirkpatrick
1;8;1028;75;these glowing proﬁles from the depths of Hell.’;kirkpatrick
1;8;1029;76;We now arrived within the deep-dug ditch –;kirkpatrick
1;8;1030;77;the channel round that place disconsolate,;kirkpatrick
1;8;1031;78;whose walls, it seemed to me, were formed of iron.;kirkpatrick
1;8;1032;79;Not without, ﬁrst, encircling it about,;kirkpatrick
1;8;1033;80;we came to where the ferry man broke forth:;kirkpatrick
1;8;1034;81;‘Out you all get!’ he yelled. ‘The entry’s here.’;kirkpatrick
1;8;1035;82;I saw there, on that threshold – framed – more than;kirkpatrick
1;8;1036;83;a thousand who had rained from Heaven. Spitting;kirkpatrick
1;8;1037;84;in wrath. ‘Who’s that,’ they hissed, ‘who, yet undead,;kirkpatrick
1;8;1038;85;travels the kingdom of the truly dead?’;kirkpatrick
1;8;1039;86;He gave a sign, my teacher in all wisdom,;kirkpatrick
1;8;1040;87;saying he sought some secret word with them.;kirkpatrick
1;8;1041;88;At which they somewhat hid their ﬁerce disdain.;kirkpatrick
1;8;1042;89;‘You come, but on your own!’ they said. ‘Let him, so;kirkpatrick
1;8;1043;90;brazen entering our realm, walk by.;kirkpatrick
1;8;1044;91;He may retrace his foolish path alone –;kirkpatrick
1;8;1045;92;or try it, if he can – while you’ll stay here.;kirkpatrick
1;8;1046;93;You’ve been his escort through this dark terrain.’;kirkpatrick
1;8;1047;94;Reader, imagine! I grew faint at heart,;kirkpatrick
1;8;1048;95;to hear these cursed phrases ringing out.;kirkpatrick
1;8;1049;96;I truly thought I’d never make it back.;kirkpatrick
1;8;1050;97;‘My guide, my dearest master. Seven times –;kirkpatrick
1;8;1051;98;or more by now – you’ve brought me safely through.;kirkpatrick
1;8;1052;99;You’ve drawn me from the face of towering doom.;kirkpatrick
1;8;1053;100;Do not, I beg you, leave me here undone.;kirkpatrick
1;8;1054;101;If we are now denied a clear way on,;kirkpatrick
1;8;1055;102;then let us quickly trace our footsteps back.’;kirkpatrick
1;8;1056;103;My lord had led me onwards to that place –;kirkpatrick
1;8;1057;104;and now he said: ‘Do not be terriﬁed.;kirkpatrick
1;8;1058;105;No one can take from us our right to pass.;kirkpatrick
1;8;1059;106;Wait here a while. Refresh your weary soul.;kirkpatrick
1;8;1060;107;Take strength. Be comforted. Feed on good hope.;kirkpatrick
1;8;1061;108;I’ll not desert you in this nether world.’;kirkpatrick
1;8;1062;109;So oﬀ he went. He there abandoned me,;kirkpatrick
1;8;1063;110;my sweetest father. Plunged in ‘perhapses’,;kirkpatrick
1;8;1064;111;I so remained, brain arguing ‘yes’ and ‘no’.;kirkpatrick
1;8;1065;112;What he then said to them I could not tell.;kirkpatrick
1;8;1066;113;Yet hardly had he taken up his stand;kirkpatrick
1;8;1067;114;when all ran, jostling, to return inside.;kirkpatrick
1;8;1068;115;They barred the door, these enemies of ours,;kirkpatrick
1;8;1069;116;to meet his thrust. My lord remained shut out.;kirkpatrick
1;8;1070;117;With heavy tread, he now came back to me.;kirkpatrick
1;8;1071;118;Eyes bent upon the ground, his forehead shaved;kirkpatrick
1;8;1072;119;of all brave conﬁdence, sighing, he said:;kirkpatrick
1;8;1073;120;‘Who dares deny me entrance to this house of grief?’;kirkpatrick
1;8;1074;121;To me he said: ‘You see. I’m angry now.;kirkpatrick
1;8;1075;122;Don’t be dismayed. They’ll fuss around in there.;kirkpatrick
1;8;1076;123;They’ll seek to keep us out. But I’ll win through.;kirkpatrick
1;8;1077;124;This insolence of theirs is nothing new.;kirkpatrick
1;8;1078;125;At some less secret gate they tried it once.;kirkpatrick
1;8;1079;126;But that still stands without its lock, ajar.;kirkpatrick
1;8;1080;127;You’ve seen the door, dead words scribed on its beam.;kirkpatrick
1;8;1081;128;And now already there descends the slope –;kirkpatrick
1;8;1082;129;passing these circles, and without a guide –;kirkpatrick
1;8;1083;130;someone through whom the city will lie open.’;kirkpatrick
1;9;1084;1;The colour that courage failing brought out;kirkpatrick
1;9;1085;2;so quickly in me, seeing my leader retreat,;kirkpatrick
1;9;1086;3;made him, the sooner, check his own new pallor.;kirkpatrick
1;9;1087;4;Intently, as though listening hard, he stopped.;kirkpatrick
1;9;1088;5;Eyesight unaided – in that blackened air,;kirkpatrick
1;9;1089;6;through foggy, dense swirls – could not carry far.;kirkpatrick
1;9;1090;7;‘This contest, even so, we’re bound to win.;kirkpatrick
1;9;1091;8;If not…’ he began. ‘Yet granted such a one…;kirkpatrick
1;9;1092;9;How long to me it seems till that one comes!’;kirkpatrick
1;9;1093;10;I saw quite clearly how he covered up;kirkpatrick
1;9;1094;11;his opening thoughts with those that followed on – words;kirkpatrick
1;9;1095;12;inconsistent with the ﬁrst he spoke.;kirkpatrick
1;9;1096;13;Yet fear came over me at what he had said.;kirkpatrick
1;9;1097;14;And so, from these truncated words, I drew;kirkpatrick
1;9;1098;15;a meaning worse, perhaps, than he had meant.;kirkpatrick
1;9;1099;16;‘Into the hollow deep of this grim bowl;kirkpatrick
1;9;1100;17;do any make their way from that ﬁrst rung;kirkpatrick
1;9;1101;18;where nothing, save for thwarted hope, brings pain?’;kirkpatrick
1;9;1102;19;I put this question to him. ‘Seldom,’ he said.;kirkpatrick
1;9;1103;20;‘It happens rarely that our people take;kirkpatrick
1;9;1104;21;the path that I am venturing to tread.;kirkpatrick
1;9;1105;22;It’s true, of course, I’ve been here once before,;kirkpatrick
1;9;1106;23;conjured to come by bitter Erichtho –;kirkpatrick
1;9;1107;24;she who called shadows back into their limbs.;kirkpatrick
1;9;1108;25;A short while only was I bare of ﬂesh;kirkpatrick
1;9;1109;26;until, as she compelled, I breached these walls;kirkpatrick
1;9;1110;27;to fetch a spirit from the Judas ring.;kirkpatrick
1;9;1111;28;That is the utmost deep, the darkest place,;kirkpatrick
1;9;1112;29;the furthest from the sky’s all-turning sphere.;kirkpatrick
1;9;1113;30;I know the way. Be conﬁdent, be sure.;kirkpatrick
1;9;1114;31;This marsh, exhaling such a nauseous stench,;kirkpatrick
1;9;1115;32;forms in a belt around the mournful town;kirkpatrick
1;9;1116;33;and not without due anger shall we enter in.’;kirkpatrick
1;9;1117;34;He said much more. But what I can’t recall.;kirkpatrick
1;9;1118;35;My eyes in all attention now were drawn;kirkpatrick
1;9;1119;36;towards the blazing summit of that gate,;kirkpatrick
1;9;1120;37;where suddenly, at one point, there had sprung;kirkpatrick
1;9;1121;38;three blood-stained Furies from the depths of Hell.;kirkpatrick
1;9;1122;39;In pose and body they were, all three, women,;kirkpatrick
1;9;1123;40;wound round about with water snakes, bright green.;kirkpatrick
1;9;1124;41;Fringing their vicious brows they bore, as hair,;kirkpatrick
1;9;1125;42;entwining snakes. Their curls were sharp-horned vipers.;kirkpatrick
1;9;1126;43;And he – who knew quite well that these were slaves;kirkpatrick
1;9;1127;44;who served the empress of unending tears –;kirkpatrick
1;9;1128;45;said to me: ‘Look! The cruel Eumenides!;kirkpatrick
1;9;1129;46;That one’s Megaera, on the left-hand side.;kirkpatrick
1;9;1130;47;Weeping there stands Alecto, on the right.;kirkpatrick
1;9;1131;48;Tisiphone’s between these two.’ He paused.;kirkpatrick
1;9;1132;49;Each rent her breast with her own ﬁngernails.;kirkpatrick
1;9;1133;50;With slapping palm, each beat herself and screamed – so;kirkpatrick
1;9;1134;51;loud I strained, all doubt, against the poet.;kirkpatrick
1;9;1135;52;‘Come now, Medusa! Turn him – quick! – to stone!’;kirkpatrick
1;9;1136;53;Staring hard down they spoke in unison.;kirkpatrick
1;9;1137;54;‘The Theseus raid went unavenged! We’re wrong!’;kirkpatrick
1;9;1138;55;‘Turn round! Your back to them! Your eyes tight shut!;kirkpatrick
1;9;1139;56;For if the Gorgon shows and you catch sight,;kirkpatrick
1;9;1140;57;there’ll be no way of ever getting out.’;kirkpatrick
1;9;1141;58;He spoke and then, himself, he made me turn;kirkpatrick
1;9;1142;59;and, not relying on my hands alone,;kirkpatrick
1;9;1143;60;to shield my eyes he closed his own on mine.;kirkpatrick
1;9;1144;61;Look hard, all you whose minds are sound and sane,;kirkpatrick
1;9;1145;62;and wonder at the meaning lying veiled;kirkpatrick
1;9;1146;63;beyond the curtain of this alien verse.;kirkpatrick
1;9;1147;64;Already across the turbid swell there came;kirkpatrick
1;9;1148;65;a shattering resonance that, charged with panic,;kirkpatrick
1;9;1149;66;evoked great tremors down each river bank.;kirkpatrick
1;9;1150;67;In this way, too, a driving wind – impelled;kirkpatrick
1;9;1151;68;by clashing currents through the burning air –;kirkpatrick
1;9;1152;69;strikes at a grove and, meeting no resistance,;kirkpatrick
1;9;1153;70;splinters the branches ﬂat and bears them oﬀ.;kirkpatrick
1;9;1154;71;So, proudly on it goes, in clouds of dust,;kirkpatrick
1;9;1155;72;shepherds and beasts all ﬂeeing in its path.;kirkpatrick
1;9;1156;73;He loosed my eyes, ‘And now,’ he said, ‘stretch straigh;kirkpatrick
1;9;1157;74;your strings of sight across this age-old scum;kirkpatrick
1;9;1158;75;to where the fumes are thickest, stinging most.’;kirkpatrick
1;9;1159;76;Like frogs that glimpse their enemy the snake,;kirkpatrick
1;9;1160;77;and vanish rapidly across the pond –;kirkpatrick
1;9;1161;78;diving till each sits huddling on its bed –;kirkpatrick
1;9;1162;79;I saw a thousand ruined souls or more;kirkpatrick
1;9;1163;80;scattering in ﬂight, ahead of one whose pace;kirkpatrick
1;9;1164;81;passed, yet kept dry, across the river Styx.;kirkpatrick
1;9;1165;82;The greasy air he wafted from his face,;kirkpatrick
1;9;1166;83;his left hand drawn before him, as a fan.;kirkpatrick
1;9;1167;84;And this was all the strain, it seemed, that tired him.;kirkpatrick
1;9;1168;85;I saw full well that he was sent from Heaven,;kirkpatrick
1;9;1169;86;I turned towards my teacher, and he signed;kirkpatrick
1;9;1170;87;that I should bend in silent deference.;kirkpatrick
1;9;1171;88;How full he seemed to me of high disdain!;kirkpatrick
1;9;1172;89;He reached the gates. And, simply with his rod,;kirkpatrick
1;9;1173;90;he opened them. For nothing held them ﬁrm.;kirkpatrick
1;9;1174;91;‘Outcasts from Heaven, driven beyond contempt!’;kirkpatrick
1;9;1175;92;Thus, in that dreadful doorway, he began:;kirkpatrick
1;9;1176;93;‘How is such truculence bred up in you?;kirkpatrick
1;9;1177;94;Why so recalcitrant against that will;kirkpatrick
1;9;1178;95;whose aim and purpose never can be maimed,;kirkpatrick
1;9;1179;96;which has so often now increased your pain?;kirkpatrick
1;9;1180;97;What is the point? Why kick against your fate?;kirkpatrick
1;9;1181;98;Your guard dog Cerberus is still (remember?);kirkpatrick
1;9;1182;99;hairless for doing so, at chin and neck.’;kirkpatrick
1;9;1183;100;He then turned back along the ﬁlthy road.;kirkpatrick
1;9;1184;101;He spoke no word to us. He had the look;kirkpatrick
1;9;1185;102;of someone gnawed and gathered up by care –;kirkpatrick
1;9;1186;103;though not the cares that here confronted him.;kirkpatrick
1;9;1187;104;And now we set our tread towards that land.;kirkpatrick
1;9;1188;105;The holy words had made us conﬁdent.;kirkpatrick
1;9;1189;106;We entered. And no force was oﬀered us.;kirkpatrick
1;9;1190;107;So, eager to survey what such a fort;kirkpatrick
1;9;1191;108;could lock within the conﬁnes of its wall,;kirkpatrick
1;9;1192;109;when once inside, I cast my eyes about.;kirkpatrick
1;9;1193;110;I see a plain, extending all around.;kirkpatrick
1;9;1194;111;And everywhere is grief and wracking pain.;kirkpatrick
1;9;1195;112;Compare: at Arles (the Rhône there forms a marsh),;kirkpatrick
1;9;1196;113;or else at Polj by the Kvarner gulf,;kirkpatrick
1;9;1197;114;which shuts the door on Italy and bathes its bounds,;kirkpatrick
1;9;1198;115;are sepulchres that make the ground uneven.;kirkpatrick
1;9;1199;116;And so, too, here, a tomb at every turn,;kirkpatrick
1;9;1200;117;except that all was done more bitterly.;kirkpatrick
1;9;1201;118;For ﬂames were scattered round among these tombs.;kirkpatrick
1;9;1202;119;The pits were therefore so intensely ﬁred,;kirkpatrick
1;9;1203;120;no tradesman needs his brand iron half so hot.;kirkpatrick
1;9;1204;121;"The covers of the tombs all stood half-raised;";kirkpatrick
1;9;1205;122;and out of each there came such cruel lamenting;kirkpatrick
1;9;1206;123;these must have been the cries from pain within.;kirkpatrick
1;9;1207;124;And I to my master: ‘Who can these all be,;kirkpatrick
1;9;1208;125;these people buried in the sepulchres?;kirkpatrick
1;9;1209;126;They make their presence felt in such pained sighs?’;kirkpatrick
1;9;1210;127;The answer: ‘These are the master heretics,;kirkpatrick
1;9;1211;128;with all their followers from every sect.;kirkpatrick
1;9;1212;129;These tombs are ﬁlled with more than you suspect.;kirkpatrick
1;9;1213;130;Those of like mind are buried each with each.;kirkpatrick
1;9;1214;131;The monuments are all at diﬀering heats.’;kirkpatrick
1;9;1215;132;He turned towards the right, then on we went,;kirkpatrick
1;9;1216;133;between the torments and high battlements.;kirkpatrick
1;10;1217;1;Onward along a secret path – conﬁned;kirkpatrick
1;10;1218;2;between those ramparts and the shows of pain –;kirkpatrick
1;10;1219;3;my teacher led and I was at his shoulder.;kirkpatrick
1;10;1220;4;‘You,’ I began, ‘true power and height of strength,;kirkpatrick
1;10;1221;5;you bring me, turning, through these godless whirls.;kirkpatrick
1;10;1222;6;Speak, if this pleases you. Feed my desires.;kirkpatrick
1;10;1223;7;Those people lying in the sepulchres –;kirkpatrick
1;10;1224;8;what chance is there of seeing them? The lids;kirkpatrick
1;10;1225;9;are oﬀ already. No one stands on guard.’;kirkpatrick
1;10;1226;10;‘These tombs,’ he said, ‘will ﬁnally be shut;kirkpatrick
1;10;1227;11;when, from Jehoshaphat on Judgement Day,;kirkpatrick
1;10;1228;12;sinners bring back their bodies left above.;kirkpatrick
1;10;1229;13;This circle is the cemetery for all;kirkpatrick
1;10;1230;14;disciples of the Epicurus school,;kirkpatrick
1;10;1231;15;who say the body dies, so too the soul.;kirkpatrick
1;10;1232;16;The question, therefore, that you’ve put to me,;kirkpatrick
1;10;1233;17;once you’re within, will soon be satisﬁed,;kirkpatrick
1;10;1234;18;so, too, the longing that you keep unsaid.’;kirkpatrick
1;10;1235;19;‘I never would – my lord, my trusted guide –;kirkpatrick
1;10;1236;20;keep, save for brevity, my heart from you.;kirkpatrick
1;10;1237;21;And brevity you’ve urged on me before.’;kirkpatrick
1;10;1238;22;‘Tuscan! You go through the city of ﬁre;kirkpatrick
1;10;1239;23;alive and speaking as a man of worth.;kirkpatrick
1;10;1240;24;Come, if you will, and rest in this domain.;kirkpatrick
1;10;1241;25;Your accent manifests that you were born;kirkpatrick
1;10;1242;26;a son of that great fatherland on which,;kirkpatrick
1;10;1243;27;perhaps, I wreaked too harsh an injury.’;kirkpatrick
1;10;1244;28;This sound, so suddenly, came ringing out;kirkpatrick
1;10;1245;29;from one among the sepulchres. Fearful,;kirkpatrick
1;10;1246;30;I shrank still closer to my leader’s side.;kirkpatrick
1;10;1247;31;‘What’s wrong?’ he said to me. ‘Just turn around!;kirkpatrick
1;10;1248;32;And see there, upright, risen, Farinata.;kirkpatrick
1;10;1249;33;From cincture upwards you will see him whole.’;kirkpatrick
1;10;1250;34;My gaze was trained already into his,;kirkpatrick
1;10;1251;35;while he, brow raised, was thrusting out his chest, as;kirkpatrick
1;10;1252;36;though he held all Hell in high disdain.;kirkpatrick
1;10;1253;37;My leader (hands in animated aid);kirkpatrick
1;10;1254;38;drove me towards him down the line of vaults.;kirkpatrick
1;10;1255;39;He counselled: ‘Let your words be duly measured.’;kirkpatrick
1;10;1256;40;So there, beneath his sepulchre, I stood.;kirkpatrick
1;10;1257;41;He looked me up and down a while, and then;kirkpatrick
1;10;1258;42;inquired, half-scornfully: ‘Who were your forebears?’;kirkpatrick
1;10;1259;43;I – always eager and obedient –;kirkpatrick
1;10;1260;44;concealing nothing, laid all plainly forth.;kirkpatrick
1;10;1261;45;At which he arched his brows a little more.;kirkpatrick
1;10;1262;46;And then: ‘In ﬁerce hostility, they stood;kirkpatrick
1;10;1263;47;against myself, my ancestors, my cause.;kirkpatrick
1;10;1264;48;And so, on two occasions, they were scattered wide.’;kirkpatrick
1;10;1265;49;‘Scattered,’ I answered, ‘so they may have been,;kirkpatrick
1;10;1266;50;but all came back from all sides, then and now.;kirkpatrick
1;10;1267;51;And your men truly never learned that art.’;kirkpatrick
1;10;1268;52;Then there arose, revealed before my eyes,;kirkpatrick
1;10;1269;53;a shadow near the ﬁrst, seen from chin up,;kirkpatrick
1;10;1270;54;which had, as I suppose, just risen to its knees.;kirkpatrick
1;10;1271;55;It looked me all around, as though intent;kirkpatrick
1;10;1272;56;on seeing whether, with me, was another.;kirkpatrick
1;10;1273;57;But when its doubting glance was wholly spent,;kirkpatrick
1;10;1274;58;weeping he called: ‘If you, through this eyeless;kirkpatrick
1;10;1275;59;prison, pass on through height of intellect,;kirkpatrick
1;10;1276;60;my son, where is he? And why not here with you?’;kirkpatrick
1;10;1277;61;‘I come,’ I said, ‘though not through my own strength.;kirkpatrick
1;10;1278;62;The man who waits there leads me through this place to;kirkpatrick
1;10;1279;63;one, perhaps, whom once your Guido scorned.’;kirkpatrick
1;10;1280;64;The way he spoke – and what he suﬀered, too –;kirkpatrick
1;10;1281;65;had now already spelled for me his name.;kirkpatrick
1;10;1282;66;And that was why my answer was so full.;kirkpatrick
1;10;1283;67;Upright suddenly: ‘What’s that you say?’;kirkpatrick
1;10;1284;68;he wailed. “‘He once…”? You mean, he’s not alive?;kirkpatrick
1;10;1285;69;And are his eyes not struck by bonny light?’;kirkpatrick
1;10;1286;70;But then, in noticing that slight delay;kirkpatrick
1;10;1287;71;which came before I oﬀered my reply,;kirkpatrick
1;10;1288;72;he fell back ﬂat, and did not re-appear.;kirkpatrick
1;10;1289;73;The other noble soul (at whose command;kirkpatrick
1;10;1290;74;I’d come to rest) in no way changed expression.;kirkpatrick
1;10;1291;75;He neither moved his neck nor bent his waist.;kirkpatrick
1;10;1292;76;But still continuing in what he’d said:;kirkpatrick
1;10;1293;77;‘If,’ he went on, ‘they learned that art so ill,;kirkpatrick
1;10;1294;78;that is more torment than this bed of pain.;kirkpatrick
1;10;1295;79;And yet no more than ﬁfty times that face;kirkpatrick
1;10;1296;80;(the moon’s, who is our sovereign here) will shine;kirkpatrick
1;10;1297;81;till you shall learn how heavy that art weighs.;kirkpatrick
1;10;1298;82;If you once more would gain the lovely world,;kirkpatrick
1;10;1299;83;tell me: how dare those burghers, in their laws,;kirkpatrick
1;10;1300;84;oppose themselves so viciously to mine?’;kirkpatrick
1;10;1301;85;My answer was: ‘The massacre, the mindless waste;kirkpatrick
1;10;1302;86;that stained the ﬂowing Arbia with blood,;kirkpatrick
1;10;1303;87;led, in our oratories, to these demands.’;kirkpatrick
1;10;1304;88;Sighing, he did now move his head. ‘In none;kirkpatrick
1;10;1305;89;of that,’ he said, ‘was I alone. And I;kirkpatrick
1;10;1306;90;would not, without good cause, have gone with them.;kirkpatrick
1;10;1307;91;I was alone – where all the rest could bear;kirkpatrick
1;10;1308;92;to think that Florence might be swept away –;kirkpatrick
1;10;1309;93;and boldly stood to speak in her defence.’;kirkpatrick
1;10;1310;94;‘Well (may your seed ﬁnd sometime true repose!);kirkpatrick
1;10;1311;95;untie the knot for me,’ I now besought,;kirkpatrick
1;10;1312;96;‘so tightly twined around my searching thoughts.;kirkpatrick
1;10;1313;97;You see, it seems (to judge from what I hear);kirkpatrick
1;10;1314;98;far in advance what time will bring to pass,;kirkpatrick
1;10;1315;99;but otherwise in terms of present things.’;kirkpatrick
1;10;1316;100;‘We see like those who suﬀer from ill light.;kirkpatrick
1;10;1317;101;We are,’ he said, ‘aware of distant things.;kirkpatrick
1;10;1318;102;Thus far He shines in us, the Lord on high.;kirkpatrick
1;10;1319;103;But when a thing draws near to us, our minds;kirkpatrick
1;10;1320;104;go blank. So if no other brings us news,;kirkpatrick
1;10;1321;105;then nothing of your human state is known to us.;kirkpatrick
1;10;1322;106;You will from this be able to deduce;kirkpatrick
1;10;1323;107;that all our knowledge will be wholly dead;kirkpatrick
1;10;1324;108;when all the doors of future time are closed.’;kirkpatrick
1;10;1325;109;And then I said, as though my heart were pierced;kirkpatrick
1;10;1326;110;with guilt, ‘Go, say to him, that fallen soul,;kirkpatrick
1;10;1327;111;his ﬁrst-born son is still among the living.;kirkpatrick
1;10;1328;112;And if, before I answered, I fell mute,;kirkpatrick
1;10;1329;113;I did so (make him understand) because;kirkpatrick
1;10;1330;114;my thoughts – which you have solved – had strayed to;kirkpatrick
1;10;1331;115;doubt.’;kirkpatrick
1;10;1332;116;By now, my teacher had already called.;kirkpatrick
1;10;1333;117;And so, with greater urgency I begged that soul;kirkpatrick
1;10;1334;118;that he should tell me who was with him there.;kirkpatrick
1;10;1335;119;‘I lie,’ he answered, ‘with a thousand, more.;kirkpatrick
1;10;1336;120;Enclosed beside me is the second Frederick.;kirkpatrick
1;10;1337;121;Cardinal Octavian, too. Of others, I keep silent.’;kirkpatrick
1;10;1338;122;And then he hid: and I, towards that great;kirkpatrick
1;10;1339;123;poet of the ancient world, turned my steps backwards,;kirkpatrick
1;10;1340;124;musing on words that seemed my enemy.;kirkpatrick
1;10;1341;125;He went his way and, as he walked, he asked:;kirkpatrick
1;10;1342;126;‘Why is it you’re so lost in thought, so blurred by doubt?’;kirkpatrick
1;10;1343;127;And I responded fully to his words.;kirkpatrick
1;10;1344;128;‘Keep well in mind,’ my lord in wisdom said,;kirkpatrick
1;10;1345;129;‘the things that you have heard against yourself.;kirkpatrick
1;10;1346;130;But now,’ his ﬁnger raised, ‘attend to this:;kirkpatrick
1;10;1347;131;when once again you stand within the rays;kirkpatrick
1;10;1348;132;that she, whose lovely eyes see all things, casts,;kirkpatrick
1;10;1349;133;you’ll learn from her what your life’s course will be.’;kirkpatrick
1;10;1350;134;And then he swung, to tread towards the left.;kirkpatrick
1;10;1351;135;We quit the wall and headed for the middle.;kirkpatrick
1;10;1352;136;The path we took cut straight into a gorge,;kirkpatrick
1;10;1353;137;and even from above the stench was foul.;kirkpatrick
1;11;1354;1;Now near the brink of a sheer escarpment;kirkpatrick
1;11;1355;2;formed in a circle from great, shattered stones, we found,;kirkpatrick
1;11;1356;3;below, a crueller bunch of souls.;kirkpatrick
1;11;1357;4;And there, against an awful overﬂow –;kirkpatrick
1;11;1358;5;a stink arising from the utmost depths –;kirkpatrick
1;11;1359;6;we huddled back together by the lid;kirkpatrick
1;11;1360;7;of one vast sepulchre, inscribed, I saw,;kirkpatrick
1;11;1361;8;in words that said: ‘I guard Pope Anastasius,;kirkpatrick
1;11;1362;9;drawn by Photinus from the rightful road.’;kirkpatrick
1;11;1363;10;‘Best not descend too rapidly, but ﬁrst;kirkpatrick
1;11;1364;11;get more accustomed in our sense of smell;kirkpatrick
1;11;1365;12;to this grim belch. We’ll then not notice it.’;kirkpatrick
1;11;1366;13;These were my teacher’s words. To him I said,;kirkpatrick
1;11;1367;14;‘Find something that will compensate, to waste;kirkpatrick
1;11;1368;15;no time.’ ‘I’m thinking, as you see,’ he said,;kirkpatrick
1;11;1369;16;and then began: ‘Dear son, within this rock-rimmed pit;kirkpatrick
1;11;1370;17;three lesser circuits lie. And these (like those you leave;kirkpatrick
1;11;1371;18;behind) go down by due degrees.;kirkpatrick
1;11;1372;19;Each rung is crammed with spirits of the damned.;kirkpatrick
1;11;1373;20;But listen now – so sight may henceforth serve – and hear;kirkpatrick
1;11;1374;21;the “what” and “why” of their constraints.;kirkpatrick
1;11;1375;22;Malice is aimed in all its forms – and thus;kirkpatrick
1;11;1376;23;incurs the hatred of Heaven – at gross injustice, and,;kirkpatrick
1;11;1377;24;aiming so, harms others, by deceit or force.;kirkpatrick
1;11;1378;25;Deceit, though, is speciﬁcally a human wrong,;kirkpatrick
1;11;1379;26;and hence displeases God the more. Liars;kirkpatrick
1;11;1380;27;are therefore deeper down, and tortured worse.;kirkpatrick
1;11;1381;28;Ring One throughout is meant for violent wills.;kirkpatrick
1;11;1382;29;But violent acts may fall upon three persons.;kirkpatrick
1;11;1383;30;And so this ring is shaped and formed in three.;kirkpatrick
1;11;1384;31;To God, to self, to neighbours hurt is done;kirkpatrick
1;11;1385;32;(to persons, of course, but also their possessions) in ways;kirkpatrick
1;11;1386;33;that you will now hear argued out.;kirkpatrick
1;11;1387;34;To those around us, death or grievous wounds;kirkpatrick
1;11;1388;35;are wrought by violent hands, the things we own;kirkpatrick
1;11;1389;36;ruined by outrage, extortion or ﬁre.;kirkpatrick
1;11;1390;37;So in the agonies of Sub-ring One,;kirkpatrick
1;11;1391;38;in diﬀerent squads, are homicides and thugs,;kirkpatrick
1;11;1392;39;vandals and looters, bandits and brigands.;kirkpatrick
1;11;1393;40;In violence, too, we turn against ourselves,;kirkpatrick
1;11;1394;41;or else our own belongings. And thus;kirkpatrick
1;11;1395;42;in Sub-ring Two are those (regret now vain);kirkpatrick
1;11;1396;43;who by their own free will strips oﬀ your world;kirkpatrick
1;11;1397;44;or gambles all their competence away,;kirkpatrick
1;11;1398;45;and weeps where, properly, they should rejoice.;kirkpatrick
1;11;1399;46;Force, too, is oﬀered to the Deity;kirkpatrick
1;11;1400;47;by hearts, blaspheming, that deny His power,;kirkpatrick
1;11;1401;48;or else scorn Nature and her great largesse.;kirkpatrick
1;11;1402;49;And so the imprint of the smallest ring;kirkpatrick
1;11;1403;50;falls on Cahorsian bankers, as on Sodom,;kirkpatrick
1;11;1404;51;and those who speak at heart in scorn of God.;kirkpatrick
1;11;1405;52;As for deceit – which gnaws all rational minds –;kirkpatrick
1;11;1406;53;we practise this on those who trust in us,;kirkpatrick
1;11;1407;54;or those whose pockets have no room for trust.;kirkpatrick
1;11;1408;55;Fraud of the second kind will only gash;kirkpatrick
1;11;1409;56;the ligature of love that Nature forms:;kirkpatrick
1;11;1410;57;and therefore in great Circle Two there nests;kirkpatrick
1;11;1411;58;smarm and hypocrisy, the casting-up of spells,;kirkpatrick
1;11;1412;59;impersonation, thievery, crooked priests,;kirkpatrick
1;11;1413;60;embezzlement and pimping, such-like scum.;kirkpatrick
1;11;1414;61;Fraud of the other sort forgets no less;kirkpatrick
1;11;1415;62;the love that Nature makes, but then, as well,;kirkpatrick
1;11;1416;63;the love particular that trust creates.;kirkpatrick
1;11;1417;64;So in the smallest ring of all – that point;kirkpatrick
1;11;1418;65;within the universe where Satan sits –;kirkpatrick
1;11;1419;66;consumed eternally, are traitors, every one.;kirkpatrick
1;11;1420;67;‘Your explanation, sir,’ I said, ‘proceeds;kirkpatrick
1;11;1421;68;with great lucidity. You clarify;kirkpatrick
1;11;1422;69;the levels of this grim abyss and all within.;kirkpatrick
1;11;1423;70;Yet tell me, too: those souls in that gross marsh,;kirkpatrick
1;11;1424;71;those swept by winds, those creatures lashed by rain, and;kirkpatrick
1;11;1425;72;those that clash with such abrasive tongues,  if they;kirkpatrick
1;11;1426;73;all, likewise, face the wrath of God,;kirkpatrick
1;11;1427;74;then why not racked within these ﬂame-red walls?;kirkpatrick
1;11;1428;75;Or if they don’t, why are they as they are?’;kirkpatrick
1;11;1429;76;‘Why,’ he replied, ‘do your frenetic wits;kirkpatrick
1;11;1430;77;wander so wildly from their usual track?;kirkpatrick
1;11;1431;78;Or where, if not ﬁxed here, are your thoughts set?;kirkpatrick
1;11;1432;79;Do you, at any rate, not call to mind;kirkpatrick
1;11;1433;80;the terms in which your Ethics fully treats;kirkpatrick
1;11;1434;81;those three dispositions that the Heavens repel:;kirkpatrick
1;11;1435;82;intemperance, intentional harm and mad;kirkpatrick
1;11;1436;83;brutality? Or that intemperance;kirkpatrick
1;11;1437;84;oﬀends God least, and least attracts His blame?;kirkpatrick
1;11;1438;85;If you think carefully of what this means,;kirkpatrick
1;11;1439;86;and summon into thought what those souls are;kirkpatrick
1;11;1440;87;who serve their sentence in the upper ring,;kirkpatrick
1;11;1441;88;you’ll plainly see why these are set apart;kirkpatrick
1;11;1442;89;from those condemned as felons, and, in pain,;kirkpatrick
1;11;1443;90;less sharply hammered by divine revenge.’;kirkpatrick
1;11;1444;91;‘You are the sun who heals all clouded sight.;kirkpatrick
1;11;1445;92;Solving my doubts, you bring me such content;kirkpatrick
1;11;1446;93;that doubt, no less than knowing, is delight.;kirkpatrick
1;11;1447;94;But still,’ I said, ‘turn backwards to the point;kirkpatrick
1;11;1448;95;where you declared that usury oﬀends;kirkpatrick
1;11;1449;96;God’s generosity. Untie that knot.’;kirkpatrick
1;11;1450;97;‘Philosophy, as those that read it know,;kirkpatrick
1;11;1451;98;takes note,’ he said, ‘on more than one occasion, of how;kirkpatrick
1;11;1452;99;the course that Nature runs is drawn;kirkpatrick
1;11;1453;100;directly from the mind and art of God.;kirkpatrick
1;11;1454;101;And if you read your Physics with due care,;kirkpatrick
1;11;1455;102;you’ll see, before you’re many pages through,;kirkpatrick
1;11;1456;103;that your art takes, as best it can, the lead;kirkpatrick
1;11;1457;104;that Nature gives – as student does from master.;kirkpatrick
1;11;1458;105;Your art is nearly grandchild, then, to God.;kirkpatrick
1;11;1459;106;From these two principles – if you recall;kirkpatrick
1;11;1460;107;the opening lines of Genesis – we’re bound to draw our;kirkpatrick
1;11;1461;108;living strength and multiply our people.;kirkpatrick
1;11;1462;109;But usurers adopt a diﬀerent course.;kirkpatrick
1;11;1463;110;They place their hopes in other things, and thus make;kirkpatrick
1;11;1464;111;mock of Nature’s self and her close kin.;kirkpatrick
1;11;1465;112;But follow on. I’m ready now to go.;kirkpatrick
1;11;1466;113;The writhing Fish have swum to the horizon.;kirkpatrick
1;11;1467;114;The Wain lies high above the Western Wind.;kirkpatrick
1;11;1468;115;The leap we now must make lies far beyond.’;kirkpatrick
1;12;1469;1;The place we’d reached – to clamber down that bank –;kirkpatrick
1;12;1470;2;was alpine crag. No eye, considering;kirkpatrick
1;12;1471;3;what else was there, would not have ﬂinched away.;kirkpatrick
1;12;1472;4;Compare: an avalanche in Adige,;kirkpatrick
1;12;1473;5;southwards of Trent, once struck the mountain ﬂank,;kirkpatrick
1;12;1474;6;"triggered perhaps by landslip or earthquake;";kirkpatrick
1;12;1475;7;and boulders from the summit shifted down;kirkpatrick
1;12;1476;8;in steps and stages to the valley ﬂoor,;kirkpatrick
1;12;1477;9;to oﬀer those up there a downward route.;kirkpatrick
1;12;1478;10;Likewise the path we trod down this ravine.;kirkpatrick
1;12;1479;11;And on the angle where the incline broke,;kirkpatrick
1;12;1480;12;there lay stretched out the infamy of Crete,;kirkpatrick
1;12;1481;13;spawned in the womb of Pasiphae’s fake heifer.;kirkpatrick
1;12;1482;14;And when he saw us there he gnawed himself,;kirkpatrick
1;12;1483;15;as though ﬂailed ﬂat within by utter rage.;kirkpatrick
1;12;1484;16;My leader in his wisdom called towards him:;kirkpatrick
1;12;1485;17;‘You may suppose that he’s the duke of Athens,;kirkpatrick
1;12;1486;18;who dealt you, in the world above, your death.;kirkpatrick
1;12;1487;19;You monster! Move aside! This one’s not come;kirkpatrick
1;12;1488;20;provided with instructions from your sister.;kirkpatrick
1;12;1489;21;He comes to see what you are suﬀering here.’;kirkpatrick
1;12;1490;22;A stunned bull, stricken by its mortal blow,;kirkpatrick
1;12;1491;23;wrenches, that instant, free from noose and rope.;kirkpatrick
1;12;1492;24;It cannot walk but skips and hops about.;kirkpatrick
1;12;1493;25;The Minotaur, I saw, behaved like that.;kirkpatrick
1;12;1494;26;‘Run!’ shouted Virgil, watching out. ‘A gap!;kirkpatrick
1;12;1495;27;Better get down while still his fury bites.’;kirkpatrick
1;12;1496;28;So down across the scree we picked our way.;kirkpatrick
1;12;1497;29;Beneath my feet, the stones would often move,;kirkpatrick
1;12;1498;30;teetering beneath the strange new weight they bore.;kirkpatrick
1;12;1499;31;I walked on, deep in thought. ‘Perhaps,’ he said,;kirkpatrick
1;12;1500;32;‘you’re thinking of this landslide? Or that guard;kirkpatrick
1;12;1501;33;whose brutal anger I have just eclipsed?;kirkpatrick
1;12;1502;34;When once before (I’d like you now to know);kirkpatrick
1;12;1503;35;I came down here and entered lower Hell,;kirkpatrick
1;12;1504;36;these cliﬀs had yet to suﬀer any rock fall.;kirkpatrick
1;12;1505;37;But certainly, if I have got this right,;kirkpatrick
1;12;1506;38;there once came One who gathered up from Dis;kirkpatrick
1;12;1507;39;the stolen treasure of its highest place.;kirkpatrick
1;12;1508;40;Moments before, a tremor in every part;kirkpatrick
1;12;1509;41;disturbed these fetid depths. The universe;kirkpatrick
1;12;1510;42;must then, I think, have felt that love through which  it;kirkpatrick
1;12;1511;43;often turns (so some suppose) to chaos.;kirkpatrick
1;12;1512;44;At that same point, these age-old crags were rent;kirkpatrick
1;12;1513;45;and left both here and elsewhere as they are.;kirkpatrick
1;12;1514;46;But ﬁx your eyes upon the valley ﬂoor.;kirkpatrick
1;12;1515;47;We now are nearing the river of blood.;kirkpatrick
1;12;1516;48;There simmer all whose violence damaged others.’;kirkpatrick
1;12;1517;49;What blind cupidity, what crazy rage;kirkpatrick
1;12;1518;50;impels us onwards in our little lives –;kirkpatrick
1;12;1519;51;then dunks us in this stew to all eternity!;kirkpatrick
1;12;1520;52;I saw there (as my guide had said I would);kirkpatrick
1;12;1521;53;a ditch of great dimensions in an arc;kirkpatrick
1;12;1522;54;that stretched its wide embrace around the plain.;kirkpatrick
1;12;1523;55;And there, between the hill foot and those banks,;kirkpatrick
1;12;1524;56;were centaurs, running in a long-drawn line,;kirkpatrick
1;12;1525;57;armed – as they’d been on earth to hunt – with arrows.;kirkpatrick
1;12;1526;58;On seeing us descend, they all reined in.;kirkpatrick
1;12;1527;59;Three of that company then sallied forth,;kirkpatrick
1;12;1528;60;their barbs and bow strings already well picked.;kirkpatrick
1;12;1529;61;And one, still distant, shouted out: ‘What pain;kirkpatrick
1;12;1530;62;have you to meet, now making down that butte?;kirkpatrick
1;12;1531;63;Tell us from there. Or else I draw my bow.’;kirkpatrick
1;12;1532;64;My teacher in response then said: ‘To Chiron –;kirkpatrick
1;12;1533;65;there, just beside you – we shall make reply.;kirkpatrick
1;12;1534;66;You are too headstrong. And you always were.’;kirkpatrick
1;12;1535;67;‘That’s Nessus there,’ he said, alerting me.;kirkpatrick
1;12;1536;68;‘He died for love of lovely Deianira,;kirkpatrick
1;12;1537;69;but then avenged himself with his own blood.;kirkpatrick
1;12;1538;70;The middle one (eyes ﬁxed upon his chest);kirkpatrick
1;12;1539;71;is Chiron the Great. He nurtured Achilles.;kirkpatrick
1;12;1540;72;Pholus, who lived so full of wrath, is third.;kirkpatrick
1;12;1541;73;Around this ditch, in thousands these all run,;kirkpatrick
1;12;1542;74;and loose their arrows at those souls that strain;kirkpatrick
1;12;1543;75;higher beyond the blood than guilt allows.’;kirkpatrick
1;12;1544;76;We drew now closer to those swift-foot beasts.;kirkpatrick
1;12;1545;77;Then Chiron plucked a shaft and, with its notch,;kirkpatrick
1;12;1546;78;he combed his beard and tucked it from his jaw.;kirkpatrick
1;12;1547;79;And, once he’d made his noble mouth thus free,;kirkpatrick
1;12;1548;80;he said to his companions: ‘Have you seen;kirkpatrick
1;12;1549;81;the one behind, how all he touches moves?;kirkpatrick
1;12;1550;82;A normal dead man’s feet would not do that.’;kirkpatrick
1;12;1551;83;My trusted leader was now standing where,;kirkpatrick
1;12;1552;84;around the waist, the double nature weds.;kirkpatrick
1;12;1553;85;He answered thus: ‘He is indeed alive.;kirkpatrick
1;12;1554;86;To me it falls to show him this dark vale.;kirkpatrick
1;12;1555;87;Necessity, not pleasure, leads us on.;kirkpatrick
1;12;1556;88;Someone whose hymn is the “Alleluia”;kirkpatrick
1;12;1557;89;paused in that song to hand me this new task.;kirkpatrick
1;12;1558;90;He is no robber, I no thievish soul.;kirkpatrick
1;12;1559;91;Now in the name of that True Power by which;kirkpatrick
1;12;1560;92;I move each step along this tangled way,;kirkpatrick
1;12;1561;93;allot a guide to us from your own band;kirkpatrick
1;12;1562;94;to show us where the ford might be, and bear;kirkpatrick
1;12;1563;95;this man beside me on his crupper.’;kirkpatrick
1;12;1564;96;He is no spirit walking through the air.;kirkpatrick
1;12;1565;97;Now Chiron turned, to pivot to his right.;kirkpatrick
1;12;1566;98;‘Go back!’ he said to Nessus. ‘Be their guide.;kirkpatrick
1;12;1567;99;Make any troop you stumble on give way.’;kirkpatrick
1;12;1568;100;The escort by our side, we now moved on;kirkpatrick
1;12;1569;101;along the shore of boiling vermilion;kirkpatrick
1;12;1570;102;where souls, well boiled, gave vent to high-pitched yells.;kirkpatrick
1;12;1571;103;Some, so I saw, were plunged there to the brow.;kirkpatrick
1;12;1572;104;‘And these,’ the mighty centaur said, ‘are tyrants.;kirkpatrick
1;12;1573;105;They lent their hands to violent gain and blood.;kirkpatrick
1;12;1574;106;So here, in tears for their unpitying sins,;kirkpatrick
1;12;1575;107;with Alexander there is vicious Dionysius,;kirkpatrick
1;12;1576;108;who brought on Sicily such grieving years.;kirkpatrick
1;12;1577;109;That forehead there – its quiﬀ as black as jet –;kirkpatrick
1;12;1578;110;is Azzolino. At his side the blond;kirkpatrick
1;12;1579;111;Opizzo d’Este, who – and this is true –;kirkpatrick
1;12;1580;112;was done to death by his own bastard son.’;kirkpatrick
1;12;1581;113;I turned towards the poet, who now said:;kirkpatrick
1;12;1582;114;‘Let him go ﬁrst and I’ll be next to come.’;kirkpatrick
1;12;1583;115;A little further on, the centaur stopped,;kirkpatrick
1;12;1584;116;arched over people who emerged, it seemed,;kirkpatrick
1;12;1585;117;throat high above the seething of that stream.;kirkpatrick
1;12;1586;118;There, to one side, he pointed out a shade.;kirkpatrick
1;12;1587;119;‘He stabbed,’ he said, ‘in the bosom of God,;kirkpatrick
1;12;1588;120;the one whose heart drips blood still on the Thames.’;kirkpatrick
1;12;1589;121;I now saw some with heads above the ﬂood,;kirkpatrick
1;12;1590;122;then others further on, their torsos clear.;kirkpatrick
1;12;1591;123;And these, in greater numbers, I could recognize.;kirkpatrick
1;12;1592;124;Then, gradually, the blood race grew more shallow –;kirkpatrick
1;12;1593;125;so that by now it only stewed their toes.;kirkpatrick
1;12;1594;126;And there we found the crossing of the ditch.;kirkpatrick
1;12;1595;127;‘On this side – see? – the boiling stream grows less.;kirkpatrick
1;12;1596;128;So, correspondingly,’ the centaur said,;kirkpatrick
1;12;1597;129;‘I’d have you understand that, over there,;kirkpatrick
1;12;1598;130;the bed is pressed, in process point by point,;kirkpatrick
1;12;1599;131;still further down until it ﬁnds the place;kirkpatrick
1;12;1600;132;at which in pain great despots wring out moans.;kirkpatrick
1;12;1601;133;Justice divine on that side sharply stings;kirkpatrick
1;12;1602;134;the hun Attila – scourge of all the earth –;kirkpatrick
1;12;1603;135;Pyrrhus and Sextus. There it also milks;kirkpatrick
1;12;1604;136;the tears eternally that boiling wave unlocks;kirkpatrick
1;12;1605;137;from Renier the Mad to Renier da Corneto,;kirkpatrick
1;12;1606;138;who wrought such strife upon the open roads.’;kirkpatrick
1;12;1607;139;And then he turned and passed the ford once more.;kirkpatrick
1;13;1608;1;No, Nessus had not reached the other side;kirkpatrick
1;13;1609;2;when we began to travel through a wood;kirkpatrick
1;13;1610;3;that bore no sign of any path ahead.;kirkpatrick
1;13;1611;4;No fresh green leaves but murky in colour,;kirkpatrick
1;13;1612;5;no boughs clean arc-ed but knotty and entwined,;kirkpatrick
1;13;1613;6;no apples were there but thorns, poison-pricked.;kirkpatrick
1;13;1614;7;No scrubby wilderness so bitter and dense;kirkpatrick
1;13;1615;8;from Cécina as far as Corneto;kirkpatrick
1;13;1616;9;oﬀers a den to beasts that hate ploughed farmlands.;kirkpatrick
1;13;1617;10;Their nest is there, those disgusting Harpies;kirkpatrick
1;13;1618;11;who drove the Trojans from the Strophades,;kirkpatrick
1;13;1619;12;with grim announcements of great harm to come.;kirkpatrick
1;13;1620;13;Wings widespreading, human from neck to brow,;kirkpatrick
1;13;1621;14;talons for feet, plumage around their paunches,;kirkpatrick
1;13;1622;15;they sing from these uncanny trees their songs of woe.;kirkpatrick
1;13;1623;16;Constant in kindness, my teacher now said:;kirkpatrick
1;13;1624;17;‘Before you venture further in, please know;kirkpatrick
1;13;1625;18;that you now stand in Sub-ring Number Two,;kirkpatrick
1;13;1626;19;and shall until you reach the Appalling Sands.;kirkpatrick
1;13;1627;20;So look around. Take care. What you’ll see here;kirkpatrick
1;13;1628;21;would drain belief from any word I uttered.’;kirkpatrick
1;13;1629;22;A wailing I heard, dragged out from every part,;kirkpatrick
1;13;1630;23;and saw there no one who might make these sounds,;kirkpatrick
1;13;1631;24;so that I stopped, bewildered, in my tracks.;kirkpatrick
1;13;1632;25;Truly I think he truly thought that, truly,;kirkpatrick
1;13;1633;26;I might have, just, believed these voices rose;kirkpatrick
1;13;1634;27;from persons hiding from us in the thorn maze.;kirkpatrick
1;13;1635;28;Therefore: ‘If you,’ my teacher said, ‘will wrench;kirkpatrick
1;13;1636;29;away some sprig from any tree you choose,;kirkpatrick
1;13;1637;30;that will lop short your feeling in such doubt.’;kirkpatrick
1;13;1638;31;And so I reached my hand a little forwards.;kirkpatrick
1;13;1639;32;I plucked a shoot (no more) from one great hawthorn.;kirkpatrick
1;13;1640;33;At which its trunk screamed out: ‘Why splinter me?’;kirkpatrick
1;13;1641;34;Now darkened by a ﬂow of blood, the tree;kirkpatrick
1;13;1642;35;spoke out a second time: ‘Why gash me so?;kirkpatrick
1;13;1643;36;Is there no living pity in your heart?;kirkpatrick
1;13;1644;37;Once we were men. We’ve now become dry sticks.;kirkpatrick
1;13;1645;38;Your hand might well have proved more merciful;kirkpatrick
1;13;1646;39;if we had been the hissing souls of snakes.’;kirkpatrick
1;13;1647;40;Compare: a green brand, kindled at one end –;kirkpatrick
1;13;1648;41;the other oozing sap – whistles and spits;kirkpatrick
1;13;1649;42;as air ﬁnds vent, then rushes out as wind.;kirkpatrick
1;13;1650;43;So now there ran, out of this fractured spigot,;kirkpatrick
1;13;1651;44;both words and blood. At which I let the tip;kirkpatrick
1;13;1652;45;drop down and stood like someone terror-struck.;kirkpatrick
1;13;1653;46;‘You injured soul!’ my teacher (sane as ever);kirkpatrick
1;13;1654;47;answered. ‘If he had only earlier;kirkpatrick
1;13;1655;48;believed what my own writings could have shown,;kirkpatrick
1;13;1656;49;he’d not have stretched his hand so far towards you.;kirkpatrick
1;13;1657;50;This, though, is all beyond belief. So I was forced to urge a;kirkpatrick
1;13;1658;51;deed that presses on my own mind still.;kirkpatrick
1;13;1659;52;But tell him now who once you were. He may,;kirkpatrick
1;13;1660;53;in turn, as remedy, refresh your fame,;kirkpatrick
1;13;1661;54;returning to the world above by leave.’;kirkpatrick
1;13;1662;55;The trunk: ‘Your words, sir, prove so sweet a bait,;kirkpatrick
1;13;1663;56;I cannot here keep silence. Don’t be irked;kirkpatrick
1;13;1664;57;if I a while should settle on that lure and talk.;kirkpatrick
1;13;1665;58;I am the one who held in hand both keys;kirkpatrick
1;13;1666;59;to Federigo’s heart. I turned them there,;kirkpatrick
1;13;1667;60;locking so smoothly and unlocking it;kirkpatrick
1;13;1668;61;that all men, almost, I stole from his secrets.;kirkpatrick
1;13;1669;62;Faith I kept, so true in that proud oﬃce;kirkpatrick
1;13;1670;63;I wasted sleep and lost my steady pulse.;kirkpatrick
1;13;1671;64;That harlot Scandal, then (her raddled eyes;kirkpatrick
1;13;1672;65;she never drags from where the emperor dwells,;kirkpatrick
1;13;1673;66;the vice of court life, mortal blight of all);kirkpatrick
1;13;1674;67;enﬂamed the minds of everyone against me.;kirkpatrick
1;13;1675;68;And they in ﬂames enﬂamed the great Augustus.;kirkpatrick
1;13;1676;69;So, happy honours turned to hapless grief.;kirkpatrick
1;13;1677;70;My mind – itself disdainful in its tastes –;kirkpatrick
1;13;1678;71;believing it could ﬂee disdain by dying,;kirkpatrick
1;13;1679;72;made me unjust against myself so just.;kirkpatrick
1;13;1680;73;By all these weird, new-wooded roots, I swear;kirkpatrick
1;13;1681;74;on oath before you: I did not break faith,;kirkpatrick
1;13;1682;75;nor failed a lord so worthy of regard.;kirkpatrick
1;13;1683;76;Will you – should either head back to the world –;kirkpatrick
1;13;1684;77;bring comfort to my memory, which lies;kirkpatrick
1;13;1685;78;still lashed beneath the stroke of envious eyes?’;kirkpatrick
1;13;1686;79;Pausing a while, he said (my chosen poet),;kirkpatrick
1;13;1687;80;‘He’s silent now, so waste no opportunity.;kirkpatrick
1;13;1688;81;If there is more you wish to know, then say.’;kirkpatrick
1;13;1689;82;‘You,’ I replied, ‘must speak once more and ask;kirkpatrick
1;13;1690;83;what you believe will leave me satisﬁed.;kirkpatrick
1;13;1691;84;I could not do it. Pity wrings my core.’;kirkpatrick
1;13;1692;85;And so he did once more begin: ‘Suppose;kirkpatrick
1;13;1693;86;that freely, from a generous heart, someone;kirkpatrick
1;13;1694;87;should do, imprisoned ghost, what your prayers seek,;kirkpatrick
1;13;1695;88;tell us, if you should care to, this: how souls;kirkpatrick
1;13;1696;89;are bound in these hard knots. And, if you can:;kirkpatrick
1;13;1697;90;will anyone be ever loosed from limbs like these?’;kirkpatrick
1;13;1698;91;At that (exhaling heavily) the trunk;kirkpatrick
1;13;1699;92;converted wind to word and formed this speech:;kirkpatrick
1;13;1700;93;‘The answer you require is quick to give:;kirkpatrick
1;13;1701;94;When any soul abandons savagely;kirkpatrick
1;13;1702;95;its body, rending self by self away,;kirkpatrick
1;13;1703;96;Minos consigns it to the seventh gulf.;kirkpatrick
1;13;1704;97;Falling, it ﬁnds this copse. Yet no one place;kirkpatrick
1;13;1705;98;is chosen as its plot. Where fortune slings it,;kirkpatrick
1;13;1706;99;there (as spelt grains might) it germinates.;kirkpatrick
1;13;1707;100;A sapling sprouts, grows ligneous, and then;kirkpatrick
1;13;1708;101;the Harpies, grazing on its foliage,;kirkpatrick
1;13;1709;102;fashion sharp pain and windows for that pain.;kirkpatrick
1;13;1710;103;We (as shall all), come Judgement Day, shall seek;kirkpatrick
1;13;1711;104;our cast-oﬀ spoil, yet not put on this vestment.;kirkpatrick
1;13;1712;105;Keeping what we tore oﬀ would not be fair.;kirkpatrick
1;13;1713;106;"Our bodies we shall drag back here; and all";kirkpatrick
1;13;1714;107;around this melancholy grove they’ll swing,;kirkpatrick
1;13;1715;108;each on the thorn of shades that wrought them harm.’;kirkpatrick
1;13;1716;109;Attention trained entirely on that stock;kirkpatrick
1;13;1717;110;(thinking, in truth, it might as yet say more),;kirkpatrick
1;13;1718;111;we now were shocked by a sudden uproar,;kirkpatrick
1;13;1719;112;as if (to make comparison) you’d heard some hog;kirkpatrick
1;13;1720;113;and all the boar hunt baying round its stand –;kirkpatrick
1;13;1721;114;a sound composed of beasts and thrashing twigs.;kirkpatrick
1;13;1722;115;And look there, on the left-hand side, there came,;kirkpatrick
1;13;1723;116;at speed, two ﬂeeing, naked, scratched to bits,;kirkpatrick
1;13;1724;117;who broke down every hurdle in that scrub.;kirkpatrick
1;13;1725;118;One was ahead: ‘Quick, quick! Come, death! Come;kirkpatrick
1;13;1726;119;now!’;kirkpatrick
1;13;1727;120;The other (seeming, to himself, too slow);kirkpatrick
1;13;1728;121;was yelling: ‘Lano! Oh, your nimble heels;kirkpatrick
1;13;1729;122;weren’t half so nifty at the Toppo rumble!’;kirkpatrick
1;13;1730;123;And then (it may be his breath was failing),;kirkpatrick
1;13;1731;124;he sank to form a clump beside a shrub.;kirkpatrick
1;13;1732;125;Behind these two, the wood was teeming, full;kirkpatrick
1;13;1733;126;of black bitches, ravenous and rapid,;kirkpatrick
1;13;1734;127;as greyhounds are when slipping from their leads.;kirkpatrick
1;13;1735;128;These set their teeth on that sad, hunkered form.;kirkpatrick
1;13;1736;129;They tore him all to pieces, chunk by chunk.;kirkpatrick
1;13;1737;130;And then they carried oﬀ those suﬀering limbs.;kirkpatrick
1;13;1738;131;My guide then took me gently by the hand,;kirkpatrick
1;13;1739;132;and led me to the bush, which wept (in vain);kirkpatrick
1;13;1740;133;through all of its blood-stained lacerations,;kirkpatrick
1;13;1741;134;saying: ‘O Jacopo da Santo Andrea!;kirkpatrick
1;13;1742;135;What use was it to take me as your shield?;kirkpatrick
1;13;1743;136;Am I to blame for your wild, wicked ways?’;kirkpatrick
1;13;1744;137;My teacher came and stood above that bush.;kirkpatrick
1;13;1745;138;‘So who were you,’ he said, ‘who, pierced to bits, breathes;kirkpatrick
1;13;1746;139;painful utterance in jets of blood?’;kirkpatrick
1;13;1747;140;‘You souls,’ he said, ‘you come – but just in time –;kirkpatrick
1;13;1748;141;to see the massacre, in all its shame,;kirkpatrick
1;13;1749;142;that rends away from me my fresh green fronds.;kirkpatrick
1;13;1750;143;Place all these leaves beneath this grieving stump.;kirkpatrick
1;13;1751;144;I too was from that city, once, which chose;kirkpatrick
1;13;1752;145;Saint John as patron over Mars – its ﬁrst –;kirkpatrick
1;13;1753;146;whose arts, since spurned, have always brought us;kirkpatrick
1;13;1754;147;harm.;kirkpatrick
1;13;1755;148;And were there not, beneath the Arno bridge,;kirkpatrick
1;13;1756;149;some traces visible of what he was,;kirkpatrick
1;13;1757;150;those citizens who built it all anew;kirkpatrick
1;13;1758;151;on ashes that Attila left behind;kirkpatrick
1;13;1759;152;would then have laboured with no end in view.;kirkpatrick
1;13;1760;153;Myself, I made a gallows of my house.’;kirkpatrick
1;14;1761;1;Seized, in pure charity, by love of home,;kirkpatrick
1;14;1762;2;I gathered up those scattered leaves, then bore them;kirkpatrick
1;14;1763;3;towards my countryman, his voice grown dim.;kirkpatrick
1;14;1764;4;And then, from there, we reached the boundary;kirkpatrick
1;14;1765;5;of circuits two and three and witnessed now,;kirkpatrick
1;14;1766;6;in horror and awe, how skilful justice is.;kirkpatrick
1;14;1767;7;To make more manifest what now was new,;kirkpatrick
1;14;1768;8;we’d reached, I’d better say, an open plain;kirkpatrick
1;14;1769;9;that dusts all vegetation from its ﬂoor.;kirkpatrick
1;14;1770;10;Round this, the wood of pain creates a fringe;kirkpatrick
1;14;1771;11;(as likewise, round that wood, the wretched ditch).;kirkpatrick
1;14;1772;12;And here we halted at the very edge.;kirkpatrick
1;14;1773;13;The ground beneath was brushed with coarse, dry sand,;kirkpatrick
1;14;1774;14;no diﬀerent from those arid Libyan wastes;kirkpatrick
1;14;1775;15;on which the feet of Cato marched to war.;kirkpatrick
1;14;1776;16;Great God! Your vengeance must be rightly feared;kirkpatrick
1;14;1777;17;by all who read the verses I compose;kirkpatrick
1;14;1778;18;to say what there was straight before my eyes.;kirkpatrick
1;14;1779;19;I saw ahead a ﬂock of naked souls.;kirkpatrick
1;14;1780;20;And all were weeping, very mournfully.;kirkpatrick
1;14;1781;21;But each was subject to a diﬀerent law.;kirkpatrick
1;14;1782;22;Some of these folk lay supine on the ground,;kirkpatrick
1;14;1783;23;and some sat huddling, tight about themselves.;kirkpatrick
1;14;1784;24;Others again strode endlessly around.;kirkpatrick
1;14;1785;25;The latter were, in number, far the more.;kirkpatrick
1;14;1786;26;Those lying ﬂat, though fewer, were in tongue;kirkpatrick
1;14;1787;27;more free at voicing their sharp miseries.;kirkpatrick
1;14;1788;28;And over all that barren sand there fell –;kirkpatrick
1;14;1789;29;as slow as Alpine snow on windless days –;kirkpatrick
1;14;1790;30;a shower of broad-winged ﬁre ﬂakes drifting down.;kirkpatrick
1;14;1791;31;Recall how Alexander, on his march;kirkpatrick
1;14;1792;32;across the climes of scorching India,;kirkpatrick
1;14;1793;33;saw clouds of ﬁre that fell around his troops;kirkpatrick
1;14;1794;34;and reached the earth still whole. He therefore made;kirkpatrick
1;14;1795;35;his squadrons stamp the ground, since, broken down,;kirkpatrick
1;14;1796;36;these vapours proved far easier to quell.;kirkpatrick
1;14;1797;37;So, too, eternally, the ﬂames fell here.;kirkpatrick
1;14;1798;38;The sand caught ﬁre, like tinder under ﬂint,;kirkpatrick
1;14;1799;39;and doubled – from beneath – the upper punishment.;kirkpatrick
1;14;1800;40;Unrestingly, their wretched hands jived on –;kirkpatrick
1;14;1801;41;now up, now down, now high, now low, slap, clap! –;kirkpatrick
1;14;1802;42;to shake fresh drops of ardour from their skin.;kirkpatrick
1;14;1803;43;So I began: ‘You, sir, in everything;kirkpatrick
1;14;1804;44;have conquered all, though not those demons, hard-faced;kirkpatrick
1;14;1805;45;at the gate of Dis, who stopped us on that step.;kirkpatrick
1;14;1806;46;That hero there, who’s he? Heedless he seems;kirkpatrick
1;14;1807;47;of these incendiaries. Scowling in scorn,;kirkpatrick
1;14;1808;48;it seems he lies unripened by the rain.’;kirkpatrick
1;14;1809;49;The man himself roared forth (for he had seen;kirkpatrick
1;14;1810;50;that I, in questioning my lord, meant him):;kirkpatrick
1;14;1811;51;‘What I, once living, was, so dead I am.;kirkpatrick
1;14;1812;52;Yes! Jupiter may tire the blacksmith out;kirkpatrick
1;14;1813;53;from whom he tore in wrath the thunder spear;kirkpatrick
1;14;1814;54;"by which I stood, on my last day, drilled through;";kirkpatrick
1;14;1815;55;and others, too, he may exhaust, in shifts;kirkpatrick
1;14;1816;56;that stoke that black forge under Mount Jabal,;kirkpatrick
1;14;1817;57;bellowing: “Vulcan! Aid, more aid! Good man!”;kirkpatrick
1;14;1818;58;just as he did when battle raged at Flegra,;kirkpatrick
1;14;1819;59;and loose his bolts at me with all his force…;kirkpatrick
1;14;1820;60;But no! No sweet revenge he’d have on me!’;kirkpatrick
1;14;1821;61;My leader then spoke out with greater strength;kirkpatrick
1;14;1822;62;than ever I, till then, had heard him use:;kirkpatrick
1;14;1823;63;‘Oh, Capaneus! Pride yet uninterred!;kirkpatrick
1;14;1824;64;This punishment, in consequence, is yours.;kirkpatrick
1;14;1825;65;No agony, except your own great rage,;kirkpatrick
1;14;1826;66;would serve as proper answer to your ire.’;kirkpatrick
1;14;1827;67;And then – a better look around his lips –;kirkpatrick
1;14;1828;68;he turned to me. ‘This man,’ he said, ‘a king,;kirkpatrick
1;14;1829;69;was one of seven laying siege to Thebes.;kirkpatrick
1;14;1830;70;God he disdained – he seems to, still – and seemed;kirkpatrick
1;14;1831;71;to pay Him scant regard. So, as I said:;kirkpatrick
1;14;1832;72;disdain alone must be his sole medallion.;kirkpatrick
1;14;1833;73;And now keep close behind. Take every care.;kirkpatrick
1;14;1834;74;Do not set foot upon these blistering sands.;kirkpatrick
1;14;1835;75;Follow the wood’s verge round at every step.’;kirkpatrick
1;14;1836;76;In silence now, continuing, we came;kirkpatrick
1;14;1837;77;to where a rill ﬂows spurting from the grove.;kirkpatrick
1;14;1838;78;Remembering its redness, I still squirm.;kirkpatrick
1;14;1839;79;As in Viterbo there’s the Bubble Brook –;kirkpatrick
1;14;1840;80;which scarlet women, bathing, share between them –;kirkpatrick
1;14;1841;81;so this stream took its course across the sand.;kirkpatrick
1;14;1842;82;That rivulet, in bed and bank, was formed;kirkpatrick
1;14;1843;83;of stone, as also were the margins by its side.;kirkpatrick
1;14;1844;84;This, I could tell, was where our best path lay.;kirkpatrick
1;14;1845;85;‘Among so many other things that I –;kirkpatrick
1;14;1846;86;since entering the gate through which;kirkpatrick
1;14;1847;87;no foot is ever disallowed an entry –;kirkpatrick
1;14;1848;88;have shown to you, nothing your eyes have spied;kirkpatrick
1;14;1849;89;has been more notable than this stream here,;kirkpatrick
1;14;1850;90;above which all the sparks grow dim and die.’;kirkpatrick
1;14;1851;91;These were the words my leader spoke to me.;kirkpatrick
1;14;1852;92;And I besought him, through his great largesse,;kirkpatrick
1;14;1853;93;to grant the food in granting me the hunger.;kirkpatrick
1;14;1854;94;‘Mid-sea,’ he said, ‘there lies a land now waste.;kirkpatrick
1;14;1855;95;To us, this land is known as Crete, where once,;kirkpatrick
1;14;1856;96;when Saturn ruled as king, the world was chaste.;kirkpatrick
1;14;1857;97;A mountain stands there, Idaeus its name.;kirkpatrick
1;14;1858;98;This, once, rejoiced in streams and leafy fronds,;kirkpatrick
1;14;1859;99;but now stands abandoned like forbidden ground.;kirkpatrick
1;14;1860;100;Once, Rhea – seeking for a sanctuary –;kirkpatrick
1;14;1861;101;chose here to lay her boy child, Jove. And then,;kirkpatrick
1;14;1862;102;to hide his wailings, called for dance and din.;kirkpatrick
1;14;1863;103;Within those caves an aged man stands tall.;kirkpatrick
1;14;1864;104;His back is turned to Egypt and Damiatta.;kirkpatrick
1;14;1865;105;Rome is the mirror into which he stares.;kirkpatrick
1;14;1866;106;His head is modelled in the ﬁnest gold.;kirkpatrick
1;14;1867;107;Of purest silver are his arms and breast.;kirkpatrick
1;14;1868;108;Then downwards to the fork he’s brightest brass,;kirkpatrick
1;14;1869;109;and all below is iron of choicest ore.;kirkpatrick
1;14;1870;110;The right foot, though, is formed of terracotta.;kirkpatrick
1;14;1871;111;On that he puts more weight than on the left.;kirkpatrick
1;14;1872;112;And every part that is not gold is cracked.;kirkpatrick
1;14;1873;113;Tears through this single ﬁssure drizzle down,;kirkpatrick
1;14;1874;114;then, mingling, penetrate the cavern wall.;kirkpatrick
1;14;1875;115;Their rocky course cascades to this deep hollow.;kirkpatrick
1;14;1876;116;They form the Acheron, Styx and Phlegethon.;kirkpatrick
1;14;1877;117;These then disgorge themselves through this tight race,;kirkpatrick
1;14;1878;118;until (since there is no way further on);kirkpatrick
1;14;1879;119;they all collect as Cocytus. But you yourself;kirkpatrick
1;14;1880;120;will see that pool. So I’ll not tell the tale.’;kirkpatrick
1;14;1881;121;‘If,’ I now put to him, ‘this gutter ﬂows;kirkpatrick
1;14;1882;122;from somewhere in our human world, then why;kirkpatrick
1;14;1883;123;do we just see it at this selvage hem?’;kirkpatrick
1;14;1884;124;‘You know,’ he said, ‘this place is circular.;kirkpatrick
1;14;1885;125;Yet, far as you have sunk in your descent,;kirkpatrick
1;14;1886;126;your path has always tended to the left.;kirkpatrick
1;14;1887;127;"So you have still not spanned the circle round;";kirkpatrick
1;14;1888;128;and if new things now show themselves to us,;kirkpatrick
1;14;1889;129;it should not stir amazement on your brow.’;kirkpatrick
1;14;1890;130;And I kept on at him: ‘And so, sire, where;kirkpatrick
1;14;1891;131;are Phlegethon and Lethe found? The one, you say,;kirkpatrick
1;14;1892;132;rains down in tears. The other you are silent of.’;kirkpatrick
1;14;1893;133;‘By everything you ask,’ he said, ‘I’m pleased.;kirkpatrick
1;14;1894;134;And yet, as one solution, you should note;kirkpatrick
1;14;1895;135;the seething redness of the waters here.;kirkpatrick
1;14;1896;136;Lethe you’ll see, but far beyond this ditch.;kirkpatrick
1;14;1897;137;Its waves are where the soul will go to wash,;kirkpatrick
1;14;1898;138;when guilt, repented, is at last removed.’;kirkpatrick
1;14;1899;139;And then: ‘It’s time for you to leave this wood.;kirkpatrick
1;14;1900;140;So come. Keep close behind me as you do.;kirkpatrick
1;14;1901;141;The banks, which are not burned, provide a road.;kirkpatrick
1;15;1902;1;We’re carried down by one of those hard shores,;kirkpatrick
1;15;1903;2;while vapours from the brook rise, arching up,;kirkpatrick
1;15;1904;3;to save both stream and margins from the ﬁre.;kirkpatrick
1;15;1905;4;Flemings, enﬂamed – from Wissant on to Bruges –;kirkpatrick
1;15;1906;5;in terror of the ﬂoods that blast towards them,;kirkpatrick
1;15;1907;6;construct great screens to put the sea to ﬂight.;kirkpatrick
1;15;1908;7;So, too, the Paduans, along the Brent,;kirkpatrick
1;15;1909;8;attempt to shield their castles and estates,;kirkpatrick
1;15;1910;9;before its source (Carinthia) is touched by heat.;kirkpatrick
1;15;1911;10;Modelled on some original like these;kirkpatrick
1;15;1912;11;(whatever master hand contrived them so);kirkpatrick
1;15;1913;12;these breaks were formed, though not that high or broad.;kirkpatrick
1;15;1914;13;By now, we’d left the grove so far behind;kirkpatrick
1;15;1915;14;that, even had I turned around to look,;kirkpatrick
1;15;1916;15;I’d not have glimpsed the tract where it was found.;kirkpatrick
1;15;1917;16;But here we came across a band of souls;kirkpatrick
1;15;1918;17;who milled around the ditch and met our tread.;kirkpatrick
1;15;1919;18;And each one peered at us – as people will;kirkpatrick
1;15;1920;19;on evenings when the moon is new – their brows;kirkpatrick
1;15;1921;20;towards us, wrinkled into squinting blades,;kirkpatrick
1;15;1922;21;like those of some old tailor at his needle.;kirkpatrick
1;15;1923;22;Eyed up and down so closely by this clan,;kirkpatrick
1;15;1924;23;I now was recognized, as known, by one;kirkpatrick
1;15;1925;24;who plucked my hem and cried: ‘How marvellous!’;kirkpatrick
1;15;1926;25;And I – as he then stretched an arm towards me –;kirkpatrick
1;15;1927;26;ﬁxed eyes so keenly through his ﬁre-baked look;kirkpatrick
1;15;1928;27;that these singed features could not fend away;kirkpatrick
1;15;1929;28;my mind from knowing, truly, who he was.;kirkpatrick
1;15;1930;29;And, reaching down a hand towards his face,;kirkpatrick
1;15;1931;30;I answered him: ‘Brunetto, sir, are you here?’;kirkpatrick
1;15;1932;31;‘Do not, my dearest son,’ he said, ‘be vexed,;kirkpatrick
1;15;1933;32;but let Brunetto Latino turn and walk;kirkpatrick
1;15;1934;33;a while along with you. The troops can run!’;kirkpatrick
1;15;1935;34;‘I pray, sir, to the utmost, do. Or should;kirkpatrick
1;15;1936;35;you wish,’ I said, ‘I’ll sit with you, so long;kirkpatrick
1;15;1937;36;as this man here agrees. I go with him.’;kirkpatrick
1;15;1938;37;‘Dear boy,’ he said, ‘if any in this herd;kirkpatrick
1;15;1939;38;should ever pause, he lies a hundred years;kirkpatrick
1;15;1940;39;powerless to fan these searing ﬁres away.;kirkpatrick
1;15;1941;40;And so move on. I’ll follow at your coat-tails;kirkpatrick
1;15;1942;41;then catch up later with that entourage,;kirkpatrick
1;15;1943;42;which, as it goes, bewails eternal loss.’;kirkpatrick
1;15;1944;43;I did not dare climb down to quit the causeway;kirkpatrick
1;15;1945;44;and walk with him on equal terms. But still,;kirkpatrick
1;15;1946;45;as though in reverence, I kept my head bowed low.;kirkpatrick
1;15;1947;46;‘What chance or destiny,’ he then began,;kirkpatrick
1;15;1948;47;‘leads you down here before your ﬁnal day?;kirkpatrick
1;15;1949;48;And who is this that shows the way to you?’;kirkpatrick
1;15;1950;49;‘There, up above,’ I answered him, ‘where life;kirkpatrick
1;15;1951;50;is halcyon, I lost myself – my path all blurred –;kirkpatrick
1;15;1952;51;in some great deep before my years were full.;kirkpatrick
1;15;1953;52;Only as dawn rose, yesterday, I turned;kirkpatrick
1;15;1954;53;aside. Then he – as yet again I turned –;kirkpatrick
1;15;1955;54;appeared, and guides me on the road back home.’;kirkpatrick
1;15;1956;55;‘If,’ so he answered, ‘you pursue your star,;kirkpatrick
1;15;1957;56;then doubtless you will reach a glorious goal,;kirkpatrick
1;15;1958;57;supposing, in the happy life, I knew you well.;kirkpatrick
1;15;1959;58;And I myself (had not I died too soon),;kirkpatrick
1;15;1960;59;seeing how kind the Heavens looked on you,;kirkpatrick
1;15;1961;60;would willingly have helped you in your work.;kirkpatrick
1;15;1962;61;But that malignant and ungrateful race;kirkpatrick
1;15;1963;62;descending ab antico from Fiesole;kirkpatrick
1;15;1964;63;(they still retain the taint of crag and hill);kirkpatrick
1;15;1965;64;will act, because you act so well, as bitter foes.;kirkpatrick
1;15;1966;65;That much is logical: no luscious ﬁg;kirkpatrick
1;15;1967;66;can rightly thrive where small, sour sorbus grows.;kirkpatrick
1;15;1968;67;The world, since ancient times, has known they’re blind.;kirkpatrick
1;15;1969;68;The tribe is grasping, envious and proud.;kirkpatrick
1;15;1970;69;Keep yourself clean of habits of their kind.;kirkpatrick
1;15;1971;70;Fortune for you reserves such great renown;kirkpatrick
1;15;1972;71;that both these factions – Black and White – will seek to;kirkpatrick
1;15;1973;72;set their teeth in you. Keep goats from grass!;kirkpatrick
1;15;1974;73;Well may these cattle from Fiesole;kirkpatrick
1;15;1975;74;make themselves straw but never touch the sprout;kirkpatrick
1;15;1976;75;that springs (if any does within their dung);kirkpatrick
1;15;1977;76;to bring to life the sacred seed of Rome –;kirkpatrick
1;15;1978;77;of those remaining when that ancient place;kirkpatrick
1;15;1979;78;became the very home and nest of malice.’;kirkpatrick
1;15;1980;79;‘If all,’ I said to him, ‘that I might ask;kirkpatrick
1;15;1981;80;were answered, and in full, then you would not;kirkpatrick
1;15;1982;81;be exiled, as you are, from human nature.;kirkpatrick
1;15;1983;82;Fixed in my thoughts, and working at my heart,;kirkpatrick
1;15;1984;83;an image of you still endures – a dear, good father – as, in;kirkpatrick
1;15;1985;84;the world, you were when hour by hour;kirkpatrick
1;15;1986;85;you taught me how a man becomes eternal.;kirkpatrick
1;15;1987;86;How great my gratitude must be, will show,;kirkpatrick
1;15;1988;87;while I still live, in all my tongue will tell.;kirkpatrick
1;15;1989;88;I write, as you recount it here, the story;kirkpatrick
1;15;1990;89;of my future course, and keep your words with others.;kirkpatrick
1;15;1991;90;A lady, if I come to her, will comment.;kirkpatrick
1;15;1992;91;On this point only I would have you clear:;kirkpatrick
1;15;1993;92;that I, so long as conscience does not chide,;kirkpatrick
1;15;1994;93;am well prepared for all that Fortune wills.;kirkpatrick
1;15;1995;94;In what you vouch, my ears hear nothing new.;kirkpatrick
1;15;1996;95;Let Fortune, therefore, do as Fortune pleases –;kirkpatrick
1;15;1997;96;whirl at her wheel like yokels at their hoe.’;kirkpatrick
1;15;1998;97;My teacher, who had now turned right-about,;kirkpatrick
1;15;1999;98;looked back at me and ﬁxed me with his eye.;kirkpatrick
1;15;2000;99;‘Those listen well,’ he said, ‘who take good note.’;kirkpatrick
1;15;2001;100;So on I go, speaking with lawyer Brunetto.;kirkpatrick
1;15;2002;101;I ask who his companions are, the great;kirkpatrick
1;15;2003;102;and good, the eminent, and men of note.;kirkpatrick
1;15;2004;103;‘Of some,’ he said, ‘you’re right to want to know.;kirkpatrick
1;15;2005;104;More laudable of others not to speak.;kirkpatrick
1;15;2006;105;Our time would be too short for all that din.;kirkpatrick
1;15;2007;106;But all of them, be sure, were men of learning,;kirkpatrick
1;15;2008;107;authorities and dons of world renown,;kirkpatrick
1;15;2009;108;besmirched, when living, with the self-same sin.;kirkpatrick
1;15;2010;109;And so, among this dismal crowd, runs Priscian.;kirkpatrick
1;15;2011;110;D’Accorso, too – the Prof. And if you yearn;kirkpatrick
1;15;2012;111;to set your eyes on such-like mangy scabs,;kirkpatrick
1;15;2013;112;you could. That bishop there! The Slave of Slaves;kirkpatrick
1;15;2014;113;transferred him to Vicenza from the Arno.;kirkpatrick
1;15;2015;114;He left his muscles, ill-distended, there.;kirkpatrick
1;15;2016;115;I would say more. Yet further I may not;kirkpatrick
1;15;2017;116;advance nor any longer talk with you.;kirkpatrick
1;15;2018;117;I see new smoke there, rising from the sand.;kirkpatrick
1;15;2019;118;I can’t consort with those who now draw near.;kirkpatrick
1;15;2020;119;My Treasury – may that commend itself.;kirkpatrick
1;15;2021;120;In that, I still live on. I ask no more.’;kirkpatrick
1;15;2022;121;Around he swung. To me he seemed like one;kirkpatrick
1;15;2023;122;who, in the ﬁelds around Verona, runs;kirkpatrick
1;15;2024;123;for that ﬁne prize, a length of green festoon.;kirkpatrick
1;15;2025;124;He seemed to be the one that wins, not loses.;kirkpatrick
1;16;2026;1;I stood already where the roar and boom;kirkpatrick
1;16;2027;2;of waters falling to the next great ring;kirkpatrick
1;16;2028;3;could now be heard – a rumble like a beehive.;kirkpatrick
1;16;2029;4;But then appeared, together, at the run,;kirkpatrick
1;16;2030;5;three shadows, swerving from a further squad;kirkpatrick
1;16;2031;6;of those in rasping torment from the rain.;kirkpatrick
1;16;2032;7;Towards us, as they came, each cried aloud:;kirkpatrick
1;16;2033;8;‘Stop there! To us, it seems, you’re dressed like one who;kirkpatrick
1;16;2034;9;travels from our own degenerate homeland.’;kirkpatrick
1;16;2035;10;No! No! I saw how branded by the bite;kirkpatrick
1;16;2036;11;of ﬁre their limbs all were. New wounds! Old scars!;kirkpatrick
1;16;2037;12;This, though mere memory, still brings me pain.;kirkpatrick
1;16;2038;13;My teacher paused, attending to their cries.;kirkpatrick
1;16;2039;14;And then, his eyes on me, he said: ‘Now wait.;kirkpatrick
1;16;2040;15;We owe to these men here some courtesy.;kirkpatrick
1;16;2041;16;Indeed, were not the nature of this place;kirkpatrick
1;16;2042;17;to shoot down barbs of ﬁre, then haste (I’d say);kirkpatrick
1;16;2043;18;should properly be shown by you, not them.’;kirkpatrick
1;16;2044;19;And so again, as now we came to rest,;kirkpatrick
1;16;2045;20;they all began the song they’d sung before;kirkpatrick
1;16;2046;21;and, turning, formed among themselves a wheel.;kirkpatrick
1;16;2047;22;Compare: prize wrestlers, with their bare skin oiled,;kirkpatrick
1;16;2048;23;circle – until they clash, then punch and gouge –;kirkpatrick
1;16;2049;24;in search of some advantage, grip or hold.;kirkpatrick
1;16;2050;25;These likewise. As they wheeled around, each ﬁxed;kirkpatrick
1;16;2051;26;their glances hard on me. And so their necks;kirkpatrick
1;16;2052;27;turned counter always to the track they trod.;kirkpatrick
1;16;2053;28;‘The misery,’ thus one began, ‘of these;kirkpatrick
1;16;2054;29;vile sands may render us, and all our prayers,;kirkpatrick
1;16;2055;30;contemptible, our faces, too, now black and burned.;kirkpatrick
1;16;2056;31;But let our reputations bend your heart.;kirkpatrick
1;16;2057;32;And who are you – now tell – whose living step,;kirkpatrick
1;16;2058;33;in perfect safety, scours the paths of Hell?;kirkpatrick
1;16;2059;34;This man, whose prints my own feet trample on,;kirkpatrick
1;16;2060;35;although he now goes naked, shorn of hair,;kirkpatrick
1;16;2061;36;was once of higher rank than you’d imagine.;kirkpatrick
1;16;2062;37;Grandson by birth of our good Gualdrada,;kirkpatrick
1;16;2063;38;he was, by title, Conte Guido Guerra.;kirkpatrick
1;16;2064;39;Much he achieved alive with mind and sword.;kirkpatrick
1;16;2065;40;The other next to him who ﬂails the sand;kirkpatrick
1;16;2066;41;is Lord Tegghiaio of the Aldobrands.;kirkpatrick
1;16;2067;42;He ought to have more pleased the world in word.;kirkpatrick
1;16;2068;43;I, in excruciating pain with them,;kirkpatrick
1;16;2069;44;was Iacopo Rusticucci. And, yes,;kirkpatrick
1;16;2070;45;it was my wife who did me greatest harm.’;kirkpatrick
1;16;2071;46;If only I’d had cover from the ﬁre,;kirkpatrick
1;16;2072;47;I’d willingly have ﬂung myself among them.;kirkpatrick
1;16;2073;48;(I think my teacher would have suﬀered this.);kirkpatrick
1;16;2074;49;But since, down there, I’d soon have singed and baked,;kirkpatrick
1;16;2075;50;fear got the better of the good intent;kirkpatrick
1;16;2076;51;that stirred my appetite for their embrace.;kirkpatrick
1;16;2077;52;So I began: ‘Great grief, not scornfulness,;kirkpatrick
1;16;2078;53;to see your state was planted in my heart;kirkpatrick
1;16;2079;54;(and only slowly will it shed its leaves);kirkpatrick
1;16;2080;55;the instant that my lord, in words to me,;kirkpatrick
1;16;2081;56;led all my inner thoughts to understand;kirkpatrick
1;16;2082;57;that persons such as you might soon come by.;kirkpatrick
1;16;2083;58;I am of your place, too. So, I have heard –;kirkpatrick
1;16;2084;59;and always with aﬀection have proclaimed –;kirkpatrick
1;16;2085;60;the deeds you’ve done and honour of your name.;kirkpatrick
1;16;2086;61;I now take leave of galling fruits, to seek;kirkpatrick
1;16;2087;62;sweet apples, promised by my lord in truth,;kirkpatrick
1;16;2088;63;but ﬁrst must reach the centre of the circle.’;kirkpatrick
1;16;2089;64;‘Long may your soul lead forth your living limbs!’;kirkpatrick
1;16;2090;65;So, in reply, said one of them. ‘And – grant;kirkpatrick
1;16;2091;66;your fame may long shine after you! – then say:;kirkpatrick
1;16;2092;67;do courtesy and valour dwell, as once;kirkpatrick
1;16;2093;68;they did, within the circuit of our city walls?;kirkpatrick
1;16;2094;69;Or have they utterly departed thence?;kirkpatrick
1;16;2095;70;Report of this, from courtly Borsiere;kirkpatrick
1;16;2096;71;(who only joined us here of late, and goes;kirkpatrick
1;16;2097;72;with our companions there), has caused us pain.’;kirkpatrick
1;16;2098;73;‘That race of newly rich, and rapid gains,;kirkpatrick
1;16;2099;74;these seeds, Fiorenza, bring to ﬂower in you;kirkpatrick
1;16;2100;75;excess and pride. And you already weep for that.’;kirkpatrick
1;16;2101;76;With head thrown back, I cried this, all aloud,;kirkpatrick
1;16;2102;77;and they, the three (accepting this response),;kirkpatrick
1;16;2103;78;glanced each to each like those who’ve heard plain truth.;kirkpatrick
1;16;2104;79;‘If at so little cost,’ they said, ‘you speak;kirkpatrick
1;16;2105;80;so well and satisfy what others seek,;kirkpatrick
1;16;2106;81;then you may happily pronounce at will.;kirkpatrick
1;16;2107;82;And so, should you escape from these dark haunts,;kirkpatrick
1;16;2108;83;and go once more to see the lovely stars,;kirkpatrick
1;16;2109;84;when you, with pleasure, say that “I was there”,;kirkpatrick
1;16;2110;85;then do, we beg you, speak of us to others.’;kirkpatrick
1;16;2111;86;With this they broke their wheel and, as they ﬂed, their;kirkpatrick
1;16;2112;87;agile limbs in ﬂight were quick as wings.;kirkpatrick
1;16;2113;88;No ‘amen’ ever was so swiftly said;kirkpatrick
1;16;2114;89;as these three disappeared before our eyes.;kirkpatrick
1;16;2115;90;And now my teacher thought that we could leave.;kirkpatrick
1;16;2116;91;I came behind. But now, not travelling far,;kirkpatrick
1;16;2117;92;the sound of the water was so near at hand;kirkpatrick
1;16;2118;93;that we could scarcely hear each other speak.;kirkpatrick
1;16;2119;94;Compare: a river, near its native source,;kirkpatrick
1;16;2120;95;runs through the eastern Apennines due east,;kirkpatrick
1;16;2121;96;and ﬁrst descends the slopes of Monte Viso.;kirkpatrick
1;16;2122;97;Its tranquil name up there is Acqua Cheta.;kirkpatrick
1;16;2123;98;But then, on ﬂowing to its lower bed,;kirkpatrick
1;16;2124;99;at Forlì it assumes a diﬀerent mode,;kirkpatrick
1;16;2125;100;and thunders here, in one great bound, above;kirkpatrick
1;16;2126;101;the Alp Saint Benedict, where – were it eased;kirkpatrick
1;16;2127;102;from ledge to ledge – the height would need a thousand.;kirkpatrick
1;16;2128;103;So, likewise, down through one great shattered force,;kirkpatrick
1;16;2129;104;we found, resounding there, a blackened stream –;kirkpatrick
1;16;2130;105;the din of which would soon have stunned our ears.;kirkpatrick
1;16;2131;106;Around my waist I wore a braided cord,;kirkpatrick
1;16;2132;107;and had on past occasion thought, by this,;kirkpatrick
1;16;2133;108;to snare the leopard with its painted hide.;kirkpatrick
1;16;2134;109;My leader told me I should slip this oﬀ.;kirkpatrick
1;16;2135;110;And when I’d got it wound from round my waist,;kirkpatrick
1;16;2136;111;I handed it across in twisted knots.;kirkpatrick
1;16;2137;112;And then he turned towards his right-hand side,;kirkpatrick
1;16;2138;113;and ﬂung it, bunched, some distance from the bank.;kirkpatrick
1;16;2139;114;It fell, to ﬁnd the depths of that great sink.;kirkpatrick
1;16;2140;115;‘Astounding things,’ I told myself, ‘are bound;kirkpatrick
1;16;2141;116;to come at this astounding sign, which now;kirkpatrick
1;16;2142;117;my master follows with his waiting eye.’;kirkpatrick
1;16;2143;118;How cautious we must always be when faced;kirkpatrick
1;16;2144;119;with those who, far beyond observing deeds,;kirkpatrick
1;16;2145;120;can gaze in wisdom on our very thoughts.;kirkpatrick
1;16;2146;121;So now he said: ‘There soon shall rise what I;kirkpatrick
1;16;2147;122;expect (what you in thought now dream) will come.;kirkpatrick
1;16;2148;123;All shall be, soon, uncovered to your eyes.’;kirkpatrick
1;16;2149;124;Always, to every truth that looks, in face,;kirkpatrick
1;16;2150;125;like lies, one ought (quite ﬁrmly) bar the lip;kirkpatrick
1;16;2151;126;lest, guiltless, what one says should still bring shame.;kirkpatrick
1;16;2152;127;I cannot, though, be silent here. Reader,;kirkpatrick
1;16;2153;128;I swear by every rhyme this comedy;kirkpatrick
1;16;2154;129;has caused to chime (may it not lack long favour);kirkpatrick
1;16;2155;130;that now, through dark and fatty air, I saw –;kirkpatrick
1;16;2156;131;to strike sheer wonder in the steadiest heart –;kirkpatrick
1;16;2157;132;approaching us a ﬁgure swimming up,;kirkpatrick
1;16;2158;133;as any diver might who’d gone below;kirkpatrick
1;16;2159;134;to loose an anchor snagged on rocks (or something;kirkpatrick
1;16;2160;135;other, hidden in the sea) and now comes back,;kirkpatrick
1;16;2161;136;arms stretching high, legs drawn to make the stroke.;kirkpatrick
1;17;2162;1;‘Behold! The beast who soars with needle tail;kirkpatrick
1;17;2163;2;through mountains, shattering shields and city walls!;kirkpatrick
1;17;2164;3;Behold! The beast that stinks out all the world!’;kirkpatrick
1;17;2165;4;To me, my lord spoke thus, then beckoned up;kirkpatrick
1;17;2166;5;the monster to approach the jutting prow;kirkpatrick
1;17;2167;6;that marked the end of all our marble paths.;kirkpatrick
1;17;2168;7;It came, that ﬁlthy image of deceit.;kirkpatrick
1;17;2169;8;Its head and trunk it grounded on the shore.;kirkpatrick
1;17;2170;9;It did not draw its tailpiece to the bank.;kirkpatrick
1;17;2171;10;The face was that of any honest man,;kirkpatrick
1;17;2172;11;the outer skin all generosity.;kirkpatrick
1;17;2173;12;Its timber, though, was serpent through and through:;kirkpatrick
1;17;2174;13;two clawing grabs, and hairy to the armpits,;kirkpatrick
1;17;2175;14;its back and breast and ribcage all tattooed;kirkpatrick
1;17;2176;15;with knot designs and spinning little whorls.;kirkpatrick
1;17;2177;16;No Turk or Tartar wove a ﬁner drape,;kirkpatrick
1;17;2178;17;more many-coloured in its pile or tuft.;kirkpatrick
1;17;2179;18;Nor did Arachne thread such tapestries.;kirkpatrick
1;17;2180;19;Compare: on foreshores, sometimes, dinghies stand;kirkpatrick
1;17;2181;20;in water partly, partly on the shingle –;kirkpatrick
1;17;2182;21;as likewise, in the land of drunken Germans,;kirkpatrick
1;17;2183;22;beavers will do, advancing their attack.;kirkpatrick
1;17;2184;23;So did this beast – the worst that there can be – there on;kirkpatrick
1;17;2185;24;the rocky rim that locks the sand.;kirkpatrick
1;17;2186;25;Out into emptiness it swung its tail,;kirkpatrick
1;17;2187;26;and twisted upwards its venomous fork.;kirkpatrick
1;17;2188;27;The tip was armed like any scorpion’s.;kirkpatrick
1;17;2189;28;My leader said: ‘We need to bend our path;kirkpatrick
1;17;2190;29;a little further down, towards that vile;kirkpatrick
1;17;2191;30;monstrosity that’s lolling underneath.’;kirkpatrick
1;17;2192;31;So down we went, towards the right-hand pap.;kirkpatrick
1;17;2193;32;Ten paces, and we’d reached the very edge,;kirkpatrick
1;17;2194;33;stepping well clear of ﬂames and burning shoals.;kirkpatrick
1;17;2195;34;And then, on getting to that spot, I saw,;kirkpatrick
1;17;2196;35;a little further on along the sandbar,;kirkpatrick
1;17;2197;36;a group just sitting near the gaping waste.;kirkpatrick
1;17;2198;37;And here my teacher said: ‘To carry back;kirkpatrick
1;17;2199;38;experience of the ring that we’re now in,;kirkpatrick
1;17;2200;39;go over there and look at their behaviour.;kirkpatrick
1;17;2201;40;But do not stay to talk at any length.;kirkpatrick
1;17;2202;41;Till you return, I’ll parley with this thing,;kirkpatrick
1;17;2203;42;for him to grant us use of his great thews.’;kirkpatrick
1;17;2204;43;So once again, along the outward brow;kirkpatrick
1;17;2205;44;of Circle Seven I progressed alone;kirkpatrick
1;17;2206;45;to where there sat these souls in misery.;kirkpatrick
1;17;2207;46;The pain they felt erupted from their eyes.;kirkpatrick
1;17;2208;47;All up and down and round about, their hands;kirkpatrick
1;17;2209;48;sought remedies for burning air and ground.;kirkpatrick
1;17;2210;49;Dogs in the heat of summer do the same,;kirkpatrick
1;17;2211;50;stung by the bluebottle, gadﬂy and ﬂea,;kirkpatrick
1;17;2212;51;swatting at swarms with paw pads or with snout.;kirkpatrick
1;17;2213;52;On some of these – these faces under showers;kirkpatrick
1;17;2214;53;of grievous, never-ceasing rain – I set my eyes.;kirkpatrick
1;17;2215;54;I recognized no single one, but noticed;kirkpatrick
1;17;2216;55;around the neck of each a cash bag hung;kirkpatrick
1;17;2217;56;(each with its own insignia and blaze),;kirkpatrick
1;17;2218;57;on which their staring eyes appeared to graze.;kirkpatrick
1;17;2219;58;So I, too, gazing, passed among them all,;kirkpatrick
1;17;2220;59;and saw, imprinted on a yellow purse,;kirkpatrick
1;17;2221;60;a blue device, in face and pose a lion.;kirkpatrick
1;17;2222;61;Then, as my view went trundling further on,;kirkpatrick
1;17;2223;62;I saw another, with a blood-red ﬁeld –;kirkpatrick
1;17;2224;63;the goose it bore was whiter, far, than butter.;kirkpatrick
1;17;2225;64;And then I heard (from one whose neat, white sack;kirkpatrick
1;17;2226;65;was marked in azure with a pregnant sow):;kirkpatrick
1;17;2227;66;‘What are you after in this awful hole?;kirkpatrick
1;17;2228;67;Do go away! Yet you – as Vitaliano is –;kirkpatrick
1;17;2229;68;are still alive. Then understand me, please:;kirkpatrick
1;17;2230;69;he’ll sit on my left ﬂank, my one-time neighbour.;kirkpatrick
1;17;2231;70;I’m Paduan, among these Florentines,;kirkpatrick
1;17;2232;71;and often they all thunder in my ears:;kirkpatrick
1;17;2233;72;“Oh, let him come,” they’ll scream, “that sovereign knight,;kirkpatrick
1;17;2234;73;who’ll bring the bag that bears three rampant;kirkpatrick
1;17;2235;74;goats.’”;kirkpatrick
1;17;2236;75;At which, in throes, he wrenched his mouth awry;kirkpatrick
1;17;2237;76;and ox-like curled his tongue to lick his nose.;kirkpatrick
1;17;2238;77;And I, who feared that, if I lingered long,;kirkpatrick
1;17;2239;78;I’d irritate the one who’d said ‘Be brief’,;kirkpatrick
1;17;2240;79;now turned my back upon these worn-out souls.;kirkpatrick
1;17;2241;80;My leader, I discovered there, had jumped;kirkpatrick
1;17;2242;81;already on that fearsome creature’s rump.;kirkpatrick
1;17;2243;82;‘Come on,’ he urged, ‘be stalwart and courageous.;kirkpatrick
1;17;2244;83;From now on we’ll descend by stairs like these.;kirkpatrick
1;17;2245;84;Mount at the front so I can come between,;kirkpatrick
1;17;2246;85;to see the tail won’t bring you any harm.’;kirkpatrick
1;17;2247;86;Like someone shivering as the grip of ‘ﬂu;kirkpatrick
1;17;2248;87;spreads over him, pale to the ﬁngernails,;kirkpatrick
1;17;2249;88;who trembles merely at the sight of shade…;kirkpatrick
1;17;2250;89;well, that was me, as these words carried over.;kirkpatrick
1;17;2251;90;The threat of shame, however, when one’s lord;kirkpatrick
1;17;2252;91;is near, emboldens one to serve him well.;kirkpatrick
1;17;2253;92;I settled down between those gruesome shoulders.;kirkpatrick
1;17;2254;93;I wished to say (my voice, though, would not come): ‘Yes.;kirkpatrick
1;17;2255;94;Please! Be sure you hold me very ﬁrm.’;kirkpatrick
1;17;2256;95;He, who in many an earlier ‘perhaps’;kirkpatrick
1;17;2257;96;had aided me, as soon as I got on,;kirkpatrick
1;17;2258;97;ﬂinging his arms around me, hugged me tight,;kirkpatrick
1;17;2259;98;and said: ‘Go on, then, Geryon. Cast out!;kirkpatrick
1;17;2260;99;Wheel wide about to make a smooth descent.;kirkpatrick
1;17;2261;100;Think of the strange new burden on your back.’;kirkpatrick
1;17;2262;101;Slowly astern, astern, as ferries leave;kirkpatrick
1;17;2263;102;the quay where they had docked, so he moved out.;kirkpatrick
1;17;2264;103;Then, only when he felt himself ride free,;kirkpatrick
1;17;2265;104;he turned the tail where breast had been before,;kirkpatrick
1;17;2266;105;and – stretching long, as eels might do – set sail, paddling;kirkpatrick
1;17;2267;106;the air towards him with his paws.;kirkpatrick
1;17;2268;107;No greater fear (so, truly, I believe);kirkpatrick
1;17;2269;108;was felt as Phaeton let the reins go loose,;kirkpatrick
1;17;2270;109;and scorched the sky as still it is today,;kirkpatrick
1;17;2271;110;nor yet by ill-starred Icarus – his loins;kirkpatrick
1;17;2272;111;unfeathering as the wax grew warm – to whom;kirkpatrick
1;17;2273;112;his father screamed aloud: ‘You’re going wrong!’;kirkpatrick
1;17;2274;113;And then with fear I saw, on every side,;kirkpatrick
1;17;2275;114;that I was now in air, and every sight;kirkpatrick
1;17;2276;115;extinguished, save my view of that great beast.;kirkpatrick
1;17;2277;116;So swimming slowly, it goes on its way.;kirkpatrick
1;17;2278;117;It wheels. It descends. This I don’t notice –;kirkpatrick
1;17;2279;118;except an upward breeze now fans my face.;kirkpatrick
1;17;2280;119;By then I heard, beneath us to the right,;kirkpatrick
1;17;2281;120;the roar of some appalling cataract.;kirkpatrick
1;17;2282;121;And so I leant my head out, looking down.;kirkpatrick
1;17;2283;122;More timorous of falling still, I saw;kirkpatrick
1;17;2284;123;that there were ﬁres down there and heard shrill screams.;kirkpatrick
1;17;2285;124;Trembling, I huddled back and locked my thighs.;kirkpatrick
1;17;2286;125;And then I saw, as I had not before,;kirkpatrick
1;17;2287;126;the going-down – the spirals of great harm –;kirkpatrick
1;17;2288;127;on every side now coming ever nearer.;kirkpatrick
1;17;2289;128;A falcon, having long been on the wing,;kirkpatrick
1;17;2290;129;and seeing neither lure nor bird to prey on,;kirkpatrick
1;17;2291;130;compels the falconer to sigh: ‘You’re coming in,’;kirkpatrick
1;17;2292;131;then sinks down wearily to where it left so fast.;kirkpatrick
1;17;2293;132;A hundred turns – and then, far from its lord,;kirkpatrick
1;17;2294;133;it lands, disdainful, spiteful in its scorn.;kirkpatrick
1;17;2295;134;So, too, did Geryon, to place us on the ﬂoor,;kirkpatrick
1;17;2296;135;the very foot of that sheer, towering cliﬀ.;kirkpatrick
1;17;2297;136;And then, unburdened of our persons now,;kirkpatrick
1;17;2298;137;vanished at speed like barbed bolt from a bow.;kirkpatrick
1;18;2299;1;There is in Hell a place called Rottenpockets,;kirkpatrick
1;18;2300;2;rock, all rock, its colour rusted iron,;kirkpatrick
1;18;2301;3;as is the wall that circles all around.;kirkpatrick
1;18;2302;4;Dead in the centre of that poisoned plain;kirkpatrick
1;18;2303;5;a well yawns open – empty, broad and deep.;kirkpatrick
1;18;2304;6;Of that (when it’s ‘convenient’) I’ll have my say.;kirkpatrick
1;18;2305;7;For now, between the well mouth and the clench;kirkpatrick
1;18;2306;8;of cliﬀ, a circling belt goes round, its ﬂoor divided into ten;kirkpatrick
1;18;2307;9;deep trenches.;kirkpatrick
1;18;2308;10;Compare: to guard the outer walls of castles,;kirkpatrick
1;18;2309;11;moats in concentric multiples are dug,;kirkpatrick
1;18;2310;12;and form the ﬁgure of a wheel around them.;kirkpatrick
1;18;2311;13;That was the pattern that these trenches made.;kirkpatrick
1;18;2312;14;And where, from fortresses, pontoons run out;kirkpatrick
1;18;2313;15;to link each threshold to the other shore,;kirkpatrick
1;18;2314;16;so, at the bottom of the precipice,;kirkpatrick
1;18;2315;17;radials ride over every bank and ditch;kirkpatrick
1;18;2316;18;till, at the pit, they’re stopped and then sucked in.;kirkpatrick
1;18;2317;19;This was the place where – shaken from the spine;kirkpatrick
1;18;2318;20;of Geryon – we found ourselves. The poet;kirkpatrick
1;18;2319;21;took the left-hand fork. I followed in his track.;kirkpatrick
1;18;2320;22;Then, to my right, I saw fresh suﬀering:;kirkpatrick
1;18;2321;23;new whips, new torments and new torturers,;kirkpatrick
1;18;2322;24;and Pocket One, with these, was all a-ﬂutter.;kirkpatrick
1;18;2323;25;Down in those depths, stark naked, there were sinners;kirkpatrick
1;18;2324;26;who came, on this side of a line, face on,;kirkpatrick
1;18;2325;27;and faster, in our direction, on the other.;kirkpatrick
1;18;2326;28;The Romans, in the Jubilee, devised;kirkpatrick
1;18;2327;29;a way for pilgrims and pedestrians,;kirkpatrick
1;18;2328;30;in all their multitudes, to cross the Bridge;kirkpatrick
1;18;2329;31;so that, on one side (making for Saint Peter’s),;kirkpatrick
1;18;2330;32;they faced the Castle and, conversely, took;kirkpatrick
1;18;2331;33;the other lane when heading for the Hill.;kirkpatrick
1;18;2332;34;This way, that way, over the dismal rock,;kirkpatrick
1;18;2333;35;there were (I saw them!) horny demons lashing,;kirkpatrick
1;18;2334;36;lashing at the rear with vicious scourges.;kirkpatrick
1;18;2335;37;Ouch! Even at the ﬁrst stroke they lifted;kirkpatrick
1;18;2336;38;"their trotters; and none of them, for certain,";kirkpatrick
1;18;2337;39;stayed for second helpings – fewer still for thirds.;kirkpatrick
1;18;2338;40;But then, as I was moving on, looks clashed,;kirkpatrick
1;18;2339;41;my own and one of theirs. I said straight oﬀ:;kirkpatrick
1;18;2340;42;‘There’s one I’ve seen before. Once was enough.’;kirkpatrick
1;18;2341;43;"To get him in my sights, I stopped my stride;";kirkpatrick
1;18;2342;44;and, pausing quietly along with me,;kirkpatrick
1;18;2343;45;my guide now let me turn a short way back.;kirkpatrick
1;18;2344;46;The body beaten abased its gaze, as if;kirkpatrick
1;18;2345;47;it thought he really could hide. That didn’t work.;kirkpatrick
1;18;2346;48;‘You there,’ I said, ‘Eyes-down! Bashful, are we?;kirkpatrick
1;18;2347;49;Assuming that your proﬁle’s not a lie,;kirkpatrick
1;18;2348;50;then you are Venedico Caccianemico.;kirkpatrick
1;18;2349;51;So what brings you to this killing pickle?’;kirkpatrick
1;18;2350;52;And he to me: ‘I grudge you my reply.;kirkpatrick
1;18;2351;53;You and your bright words grind one out of me,;kirkpatrick
1;18;2352;54;and make me call the world that was to mind.;kirkpatrick
1;18;2353;55;"Foul tittletattle got this right. It’s me;";kirkpatrick
1;18;2354;56;I ﬁxed it. My sister Ghisolabella;kirkpatrick
1;18;2355;57;did let the marquis have his way with her.;kirkpatrick
1;18;2356;58;Don’t think, though, I’m the only Bolognese;kirkpatrick
1;18;2357;59;who’s here in tears. The place is full of us.;kirkpatrick
1;18;2358;60;Between the rivers Sàvena and Reno,;kirkpatrick
1;18;2359;61;far fewer tongues speak “yes” as “yeah” than here.;kirkpatrick
1;18;2360;62;And if you want to get this straight, recall;kirkpatrick
1;18;2361;63;what money means to Bolognese hearts.’;kirkpatrick
1;18;2362;64;And, as he spoke, a devil now struck out:;kirkpatrick
1;18;2363;65;‘Push oﬀ, you pimp,’ he said, and swung his lash.;kirkpatrick
1;18;2364;66;‘There aren’t tarts here for you to turn to cash.’;kirkpatrick
1;18;2365;67;I turned to join my escort once again,;kirkpatrick
1;18;2366;68;and walked with him a few steps further on,;kirkpatrick
1;18;2367;69;then reached an outcrop jutting from the bank.;kirkpatrick
1;18;2368;70;We made our way quite easily up that,;kirkpatrick
1;18;2369;71;then, turning right along the splintered ridge, we left that;kirkpatrick
1;18;2370;72;bunch to endless circulation.;kirkpatrick
1;18;2371;73;So now we came to where the vault gapes wide;kirkpatrick
1;18;2372;74;to let those beaten beings pass beneath.;kirkpatrick
1;18;2373;75;‘Pause here,’ said Virgil, ‘and ensure some glimpse  of;kirkpatrick
1;18;2374;76;all these woebegones now marks your eye.;kirkpatrick
1;18;2375;77;They go in our direction. So, as yet,;kirkpatrick
1;18;2376;78;you’ve had no chance to look them in the face.;kirkpatrick
1;18;2377;79;We saw from that decrepit bridge the traces;kirkpatrick
1;18;2378;80;of a second crew. These came towards us.;kirkpatrick
1;18;2379;81;These, as well, were driven by whistling whips.;kirkpatrick
1;18;2380;82;I did not prompt him, but my mentor said:;kirkpatrick
1;18;2381;83;‘Look at that hero there, advancing now!;kirkpatrick
1;18;2382;84;He seems, for all his pain, to shed no tear.;kirkpatrick
1;18;2383;85;How great an air of majesty he still retains!;kirkpatrick
1;18;2384;86;He is that Jason who, astute and strong,;kirkpatrick
1;18;2385;87;made Colchos grieve to lose its gold-ﬂeeced ram.;kirkpatrick
1;18;2386;88;Journeying on, he passed the isle of Lemnos,;kirkpatrick
1;18;2387;89;where cold and reckless women had, by then,;kirkpatrick
1;18;2388;90;delivered death to every living male.;kirkpatrick
1;18;2389;91;Yet he, with hints and eloquence of phrase,;kirkpatrick
1;18;2390;92;beguiled the young Hypsipyle – a girl;kirkpatrick
1;18;2391;93;who had herself proved guileful to the rest.;kirkpatrick
1;18;2392;94;Alone he left her there, alone, with child.;kirkpatrick
1;18;2393;95;That crime incurs for him this penalty;kirkpatrick
1;18;2394;96;which also stands as vengeance for Medea.;kirkpatrick
1;18;2395;97;Along with him go all who turned such tricks.;kirkpatrick
1;18;2396;98;And that’s enough to know about this vale,;kirkpatrick
1;18;2397;99;or else of those who’re caught within its fangs.’;kirkpatrick
1;18;2398;100;We’d come already to the point at which;kirkpatrick
1;18;2399;101;the tight path crosses with the second bank;kirkpatrick
1;18;2400;102;and makes a shoulder to another arch.;kirkpatrick
1;18;2401;103;And now we heard, from Pocket Number Two,;kirkpatrick
1;18;2402;104;the groans and griping of another lot,;kirkpatrick
1;18;2403;105;the snuﬄing of their snouts, their slapping palms.;kirkpatrick
1;18;2404;106;The banks were crusted with a slime and mould;kirkpatrick
1;18;2405;107;that rose up in porridgy exhalations;kirkpatrick
1;18;2406;108;and, scuﬄing, violated eye and nose.;kirkpatrick
1;18;2407;109;The bottom of that pit goes down so deep;kirkpatrick
1;18;2408;110;we saw it only when we climbed the ridge;kirkpatrick
1;18;2409;111;and stood to see the rock rise straight above.;kirkpatrick
1;18;2410;112;Reaching that point and looking down, we saw;kirkpatrick
1;18;2411;113;that all of them were plunged in diarrhoea;kirkpatrick
1;18;2412;114;ﬂowing, it seemed, from human cubicles.;kirkpatrick
1;18;2413;115;And while my eyes were searching deep within,;kirkpatrick
1;18;2414;116;I noticed one whose head was foul with shit.;kirkpatrick
1;18;2415;117;Had he the tonsure? It was hard to tell.;kirkpatrick
1;18;2416;118;But he screamed out at me: ‘Why gawp like that,;kirkpatrick
1;18;2417;119;so hungry-eyed for me and not the other swill?’;kirkpatrick
1;18;2418;120;‘Because,’ I said, ‘if I remember well,;kirkpatrick
1;18;2419;121;I’ve seen you once before, with drier coiﬀure.;kirkpatrick
1;18;2420;122;You are from Lucca. Alessio Interminei.;kirkpatrick
1;18;2421;123;And that is why I’ve got my eye on you.’;kirkpatrick
1;18;2422;124;He answered (battering his turnip top):;kirkpatrick
1;18;2423;125;‘I’m sunk this deep because of ﬂatteries –;kirkpatrick
1;18;2424;126;none were too sickly for my tongue to speak.’;kirkpatrick
1;18;2425;127;When that was done, my leader now went on:;kirkpatrick
1;18;2426;128;‘Just poke your nose a little further out.;kirkpatrick
1;18;2427;129;Your eyes may then be able to detect;kirkpatrick
1;18;2428;130;a slut down there – ﬁlthy, with tangled hair,;kirkpatrick
1;18;2429;131;scratting herself with cacky ﬁngernails,;kirkpatrick
1;18;2430;132;squatting at one time, upright at the next.;kirkpatrick
1;18;2431;133;Thais! She’s there, the whore, the one who cooed;kirkpatrick
1;18;2432;134;to her hot panting swain (“Yeees! Good for you?”), “Angel,;kirkpatrick
1;18;2433;135;a miracle! My thanks indeed!”;kirkpatrick
1;18;2434;136;Let that be all that here we need to view.’;kirkpatrick
1;19;2435;1;You! Magic Simon, and your sorry school!;kirkpatrick
1;19;2436;2;Things that are God’s own – things that, truly, are the;kirkpatrick
1;19;2437;3;brides of goodness – lusting cruelly;kirkpatrick
1;19;2438;4;after gold and silver, you turn them all to whores.;kirkpatrick
1;19;2439;5;The trumpet now (and rightly!) sounds for you.;kirkpatrick
1;19;2440;6;There you all are, well set in Pocket Three.;kirkpatrick
1;19;2441;7;Onwards towards this yawning tomb, mounting;kirkpatrick
1;19;2442;8;the ridge, by now we’d reached its summit –;kirkpatrick
1;19;2443;9;the point that plumbs the middle of the ditch.;kirkpatrick
1;19;2444;10;O wisdom in the height, how great the art;kirkpatrick
1;19;2445;11;that you display in Heaven, on earth and even;kirkpatrick
1;19;2446;12;in that evil world! How justly you deal power!;kirkpatrick
1;19;2447;13;I saw how all the livid rock was drilled;kirkpatrick
1;19;2448;14;with holes – along its ﬂanks, across its ﬂoor –;kirkpatrick
1;19;2449;15;all circular, and all of equal measure.;kirkpatrick
1;19;2450;16;To me they seemed, in radius, no more nor less;kirkpatrick
1;19;2451;17;than fonts that, in my own beloved Saint John’s,;kirkpatrick
1;19;2452;18;allow the priest at baptisms a place to stand.;kirkpatrick
1;19;2453;19;(Not long ago, I shattered one of those.;kirkpatrick
1;19;2454;20;Someone was drowning there. I got them out.;kirkpatrick
1;19;2455;21;This, sealed and sworn, is nothing but the truth.)  Out of;kirkpatrick
1;19;2456;22;the mouth of every single hole;kirkpatrick
1;19;2457;23;there ﬂoated up a pair of sinner feet,;kirkpatrick
1;19;2458;24;legs to the ham on show, the rest concealed.;kirkpatrick
1;19;2459;25;The soles of all these feet were set alight,;kirkpatrick
1;19;2460;26;and each pair wriggled at the joint so hard;kirkpatrick
1;19;2461;27;they’d easily have ripped a rope or lanyard.;kirkpatrick
1;19;2462;28;As ﬂames go ﬂickering round some greasy thing;kirkpatrick
1;19;2463;29;and hover just above its outer rind,;kirkpatrick
1;19;2464;30;so these ﬂames also, toe tip to heel end.;kirkpatrick
1;19;2465;31;‘Who, sir,’ I said, ‘is that one there? That one;kirkpatrick
1;19;2466;32;who jerks in pain far greater than his cònfreres ,;kirkpatrick
1;19;2467;33;sucked at by ﬂames more ﬁercely vermilion.’;kirkpatrick
1;19;2468;34;‘I’ll lift you down,’ he answered me, ‘if you;kirkpatrick
1;19;2469;35;insist. We’ll take that bank the easier.;kirkpatrick
1;19;2470;36;He’ll talk to you himself about his twists.’;kirkpatrick
1;19;2471;37;‘Whatever pleases you,’ I said, ‘to me is good.;kirkpatrick
1;19;2472;38;Lord, you remain: I’ll not depart – you know –;kirkpatrick
1;19;2473;39;from what you will. You read my silent thoughts.’;kirkpatrick
1;19;2474;40;So on we went to the fourth embankment.;kirkpatrick
1;19;2475;41;We turned around, descended on our left,;kirkpatrick
1;19;2476;42;arriving at that pitted, straitened ﬂoor.;kirkpatrick
1;19;2477;43;My teacher, kindly, did not set me down –;kirkpatrick
1;19;2478;44;nor loose me from his hip hold – till we’d reached that;kirkpatrick
1;19;2479;45;ﬁssure where (all tears) shanks shuddered.;kirkpatrick
1;19;2480;46;‘Whatever you might be there, upside down,;kirkpatrick
1;19;2481;47;staked, you unhappy spirit, like a pole,;kirkpatrick
1;19;2482;48;if you,’ I said, ‘are able, then speak out.’;kirkpatrick
1;19;2483;49;So there I stood like any friar who shrives;kirkpatrick
1;19;2484;50;the hired assassin – head down in the earth –;kirkpatrick
1;19;2485;51;who calls him back to put oﬀ stiﬂing death.;kirkpatrick
1;19;2486;52;And he yelled out: ‘Is that you standing there?;kirkpatrick
1;19;2487;53;Are you there, on your feet still, Boniface?;kirkpatrick
1;19;2488;54;The writings lied to me by quite some years.;kirkpatrick
1;19;2489;55;Are you so sick of owning things already?;kirkpatrick
1;19;2490;56;Till now, you’ve hardly been afraid to cheat;kirkpatrick
1;19;2491;57;our lovely woman, tearing her to shreds.’;kirkpatrick
1;19;2492;58;Well, I just stood there (you will know just how);kirkpatrick
1;19;2493;59;simply not getting what I’d heard come out,;kirkpatrick
1;19;2494;60;feeling a fool, uncertain what to say.;kirkpatrick
1;19;2495;61;Then Virgil entered: ‘Say this – and make speed:;kirkpatrick
1;19;2496;62;“No, that’s not me. I am not who you think.” ‘;kirkpatrick
1;19;2497;63;And so I answered as he’d said I should.;kirkpatrick
1;19;2498;64;At which – all feet – the spirit thrashed about,;kirkpatrick
1;19;2499;65;then, sighing loudly in a tearful voice:;kirkpatrick
1;19;2500;66;‘So what is it you want of me?’ he said.;kirkpatrick
1;19;2501;67;‘If you’re so keen to know who I might be,;kirkpatrick
1;19;2502;68;and ran all down that slope to ﬁnd me out,;kirkpatrick
1;19;2503;69;you’d better know I wore the papal cope.;kirkpatrick
1;19;2504;70;A true Orsini, son of Ursa Bear,;kirkpatrick
1;19;2505;71;I showed such greed in favouring her brats;kirkpatrick
1;19;2506;72;that – up there well in pocket – I’m in pocket here.;kirkpatrick
1;19;2507;73;Below me, in great stacks beneath my head,;kirkpatrick
1;19;2508;74;packed tight in every cranny of the rock,;kirkpatrick
1;19;2509;75;are all my antecedents in the Simon line.;kirkpatrick
1;19;2510;76;Down there I’ll sink, in that same way, when he;kirkpatrick
1;19;2511;77;arrives whom I supposed that you might be,;kirkpatrick
1;19;2512;78;and uttered, therefore, my abrupt inquiry.;kirkpatrick
1;19;2513;79;But I already – feet up on the grill, tossed;kirkpatrick
1;19;2514;80;upside down – have passed more time;kirkpatrick
1;19;2515;81;than Boniface yet will, stuck here with red hot toes.;kirkpatrick
1;19;2516;82;For after him from westwards there’ll appear;kirkpatrick
1;19;2517;83;that lawless shepherd, uglier in deed,;kirkpatrick
1;19;2518;84;who then, for both of us, will form a lid.;kirkpatrick
1;19;2519;85;He shall be known as a “Jason-Once-Again”.;kirkpatrick
1;19;2520;86;We read in Maccabees: “Priest Bribes a King.”;kirkpatrick
1;19;2521;87;This other will score well with one French prince.’;kirkpatrick
1;19;2522;88;I may have been plain mad. I do not know.;kirkpatrick
1;19;2523;89;But now, in measured verse, I sang these words:;kirkpatrick
1;19;2524;90;‘Tell me, I pray: what riches did Our Lord;kirkpatrick
1;19;2525;91;demand, as ﬁrst instalment, from Saint Peter;kirkpatrick
1;19;2526;92;before He placed the keys in his command?;kirkpatrick
1;19;2527;93;He asked (be sure) no more than: “Come behind me.”;kirkpatrick
1;19;2528;94;Nor did Saint Peter, or the rest of them,;kirkpatrick
1;19;2529;95;receive from Matthias a gold or silver piece,;kirkpatrick
1;19;2530;96;allotting him the place that Judas lost.;kirkpatrick
1;19;2531;97;So you stay put. You merit punishment.;kirkpatrick
1;19;2532;98;But keep your eye on that ill-gotten coin;kirkpatrick
1;19;2533;99;that made you bold with Charles the Angevin.;kirkpatrick
1;19;2534;100;And, were I not forbidden, as I am,;kirkpatrick
1;19;2535;101;by reverence for those keys, supreme and holy,;kirkpatrick
1;19;2536;102;that you hung on to in the happy life,;kirkpatrick
1;19;2537;103;I now would bring still weightier words to bear.;kirkpatrick
1;19;2538;104;You and your greed bring misery to the world,;kirkpatrick
1;19;2539;105;trampling the good and raising up the wicked.;kirkpatrick
1;19;2540;106;Saint John took heed of shepherds such as you.;kirkpatrick
1;19;2541;107;He saw revealed that She-above-the-Waves,;kirkpatrick
1;19;2542;108;whoring it up with Rulers of the earth,;kirkpatrick
1;19;2543;109;she who in truth was born with seven heads;kirkpatrick
1;19;2544;110;and fed herself, in truth, from ten pure horns,;kirkpatrick
1;19;2545;111;as long as she in virtue pleased her man.;kirkpatrick
1;19;2546;112;Silver and gold you have made your god. And what’s;kirkpatrick
1;19;2547;113;the odds – you and some idol-worshipper?;kirkpatrick
1;19;2548;114;He prays to one, you to a gilded hundred.;kirkpatrick
1;19;2549;115;What harm you mothered, Emperor Constantine!;kirkpatrick
1;19;2550;116;Not your conversion but the dowry he –;kirkpatrick
1;19;2551;117;that ﬁrst rich Papa – thus obtained from you!’;kirkpatrick
1;19;2552;118;And all the time I chanted out these notes,;kirkpatrick
1;19;2553;119;he, in his wrath or bitten by remorse,;kirkpatrick
1;19;2554;120;ﬂapped, with great force, the ﬂat of both his feet.;kirkpatrick
1;19;2555;121;My leader, I believe, was very pleased.;kirkpatrick
1;19;2556;122;In listening to these sounding words of truth,;kirkpatrick
1;19;2557;123;he stood there satisﬁed, his lips compressed.;kirkpatrick
1;19;2558;124;So, too, he took me up in his embrace.;kirkpatrick
1;19;2559;125;Then, bodily, he clasped me to his breast;kirkpatrick
1;19;2560;126;and climbed again the path where he’d come down.;kirkpatrick
1;19;2561;127;Nor did he tire of holding me so tight.;kirkpatrick
1;19;2562;128;He bore me to the summit of that arch;kirkpatrick
1;19;2563;129;spanning the banks of Pockets Four and Five.;kirkpatrick
1;19;2564;130;And there he gently put his burden down,;kirkpatrick
1;19;2565;131;gently on rocks so craggy and so steep;kirkpatrick
1;19;2566;132;they might have seemed to goats too hard to cross.;kirkpatrick
1;19;2567;133;From there, another valley was disclosed.;kirkpatrick
1;20;2568;1;I now must turn a strange new pain to verse;kirkpatrick
1;20;2569;2;and give some substance to this twentieth chant;kirkpatrick
1;20;2570;3;that deals (Cantica ) with sunken souls.;kirkpatrick
1;20;2571;4;Already I had set myself to peer;kirkpatrick
1;20;2572;5;intently on those now-discovered depths,;kirkpatrick
1;20;2573;6;washed as they were with agonizing tears.;kirkpatrick
1;20;2574;7;I saw there people circling round that trench.;kirkpatrick
1;20;2575;8;And on they came in silence, weeping still –;kirkpatrick
1;20;2576;9;as slow in pace as litanies on earth.;kirkpatrick
1;20;2577;10;Then, as my gaze sank lower down these forms,;kirkpatrick
1;20;2578;11;each was revealed (the wonder of it all!);kirkpatrick
1;20;2579;12;twisted around between the chin and thorax.;kirkpatrick
1;20;2580;13;The face of each looked down towards its coccyx.;kirkpatrick
1;20;2581;14;And each, deprived of vision to the front,;kirkpatrick
1;20;2582;15;came, as it must, reversed along its way.;kirkpatrick
1;20;2583;16;Seized by some paralytic ﬁt, others,;kirkpatrick
1;20;2584;17;perhaps, have been so turned awry. But I –;kirkpatrick
1;20;2585;18;not having seen, myself – don’t credit it.;kirkpatrick
1;20;2586;19;That God may grant you, as you read, the fruit;kirkpatrick
1;20;2587;20;that you deserve in reading, think, yourselves:;kirkpatrick
1;20;2588;21;could I have kept my own face dry, to see,;kirkpatrick
1;20;2589;22;close by, that image of our human self;kirkpatrick
1;20;2590;23;so wrenched from true that teardrops from the eyes;kirkpatrick
1;20;2591;24;ran down to rinse them where the buttocks cleave?;kirkpatrick
1;20;2592;25;Of this, be sure: that, leaning on a spur;kirkpatrick
1;20;2593;26;of that unyielding cliﬀ, I wept. ‘Are you,’;kirkpatrick
1;20;2594;27;my escort said, ‘like them, an idiot still?;kirkpatrick
1;20;2595;28;Here pity lives where pity’s truth is dead.;kirkpatrick
1;20;2596;29;Who is more impious, more scarred with sin;kirkpatrick
1;20;2597;30;than one who pleads compassion at God’s throne?;kirkpatrick
1;20;2598;31;Lift up your head! Stand straight. See, that one there?;kirkpatrick
1;20;2599;32;"Under his chariot wheels, the earth yawned wide;";kirkpatrick
1;20;2600;33;and Thebes – all eyes – yelled: “Where, Amphiaraus,;kirkpatrick
1;20;2601;34;headlong away? Why leave us in this strife?”;kirkpatrick
1;20;2602;35;Into the ceaseless void he fell, until;kirkpatrick
1;20;2603;36;he came where Minos stands, who seizes all.;kirkpatrick
1;20;2604;37;He’s formed his chest – amazingly – from shoulder.;kirkpatrick
1;20;2605;38;As once he wished to see too far ahead,;kirkpatrick
1;20;2606;39;his tread is backward, and he stares to rear.;kirkpatrick
1;20;2607;40;See there Tiresias! Male-to-female switch.;kirkpatrick
1;20;2608;41;His looks, mutating, were entirely changed,;kirkpatrick
1;20;2609;42;his members altering till each was each.;kirkpatrick
1;20;2610;43;And then, to win once more his virile plumes,;kirkpatrick
1;20;2611;44;he needs must strike a second time, and shake;kirkpatrick
1;20;2612;45;again at coupling snakes his witch’s wand.;kirkpatrick
1;20;2613;46;Then, spine to gut, the prophet Arruns comes.;kirkpatrick
1;20;2614;47;High in the Lunigiana hills – over;kirkpatrick
1;20;2615;48;Carrara homesteads, so hard-hoed by serfs –;kirkpatrick
1;20;2616;49;he found a grotto in the marble cliﬀs;kirkpatrick
1;20;2617;50;and took this for his dwelling place. Nothing,;kirkpatrick
1;20;2618;51;from there, cuts oﬀ the view of sea or star.;kirkpatrick
1;20;2619;52;And then there’s one whose breasts you cannot see;kirkpatrick
1;20;2620;53;(since these are mantled by her ﬂowing strands);kirkpatrick
1;20;2621;54;who shows on that side all her shaggy ﬂeece.;kirkpatrick
1;20;2622;55;She, once, was Manto, scouring many lands,;kirkpatrick
1;20;2623;56;until she reached and settled at my birthplace.;kirkpatrick
1;20;2624;57;And so – to please me – listen for a while.;kirkpatrick
1;20;2625;58;Her father, having left this life – and Thebes,;kirkpatrick
1;20;2626;59;the place of Bacchus, being now in thrall –;kirkpatrick
1;20;2627;60;for years she travelled, searching through this world.;kirkpatrick
1;20;2628;61;Above, in lovely Italy, there lies a lake;kirkpatrick
1;20;2629;62;(in Latin: Benacus) beneath those Alps;kirkpatrick
1;20;2630;63;that lock out Germany beyond the high Tyrol.;kirkpatrick
1;20;2631;64;From waters gathered in that standing pool;kirkpatrick
1;20;2632;65;a thousand springs, I think, or more, refresh;kirkpatrick
1;20;2633;66;the lands between those peaks, Camonica and Garda.;kirkpatrick
1;20;2634;67;There is a place, the central point of these,;kirkpatrick
1;20;2635;68;where pastors – if they choose to sail from Brescia, from;kirkpatrick
1;20;2636;69;Verona and from Trent – have power to bless.;kirkpatrick
1;20;2637;70;Here that brave citadel Peschiera sits,;kirkpatrick
1;20;2638;71;built where the shoreline sinks to reach a low,;kirkpatrick
1;20;2639;72;boldly outfacing Bergamese and Brescians.;kirkpatrick
1;20;2640;73;Cascading from the lap of Benacus,;kirkpatrick
1;20;2641;74;waters, unstayably, must run down here.;kirkpatrick
1;20;2642;75;Through lush green meadows these all form a stream.;kirkpatrick
1;20;2643;76;And this, when it begins to run, is known;kirkpatrick
1;20;2644;77;by name as Mincio, not Benacus.;kirkpatrick
1;20;2645;78;(It meets the river Po around Govérnolo.);kirkpatrick
1;20;2646;79;Moving, the Mincio at once dips down,;kirkpatrick
1;20;2647;80;then, broadening in the plain, it forms a marsh –;kirkpatrick
1;20;2648;81;and this in summer can be foul and brackish.;kirkpatrick
1;20;2649;82;Manto, that bitter virgin, passing by,;kirkpatrick
1;20;2650;83;saw, in the centre of that great morass,;kirkpatrick
1;20;2651;84;a place unploughed and bare of population.;kirkpatrick
1;20;2652;85;There, ﬂeeing still from human fellowship,;kirkpatrick
1;20;2653;86;she settled with her vassals, plied her arts,;kirkpatrick
1;20;2654;87;in this place lived, here left her empty corpse.;kirkpatrick
1;20;2655;88;Then other peoples came who had, so long,;kirkpatrick
1;20;2656;89;been scattered all about. Because the marsh;kirkpatrick
1;20;2657;90;surrounded it, the site was safe and strong.;kirkpatrick
1;20;2658;91;They raised their city over those dead bones.;kirkpatrick
1;20;2659;92;They called it Mantua (no magic charm!),;kirkpatrick
1;20;2660;93;since Manto ﬁrst had made the place her own.;kirkpatrick
1;20;2661;94;Those living there were once more numerous,;kirkpatrick
1;20;2662;95;before the idiotic Casalodi was;kirkpatrick
1;20;2663;96;so taken in by Pinamonte’s trick.;kirkpatrick
1;20;2664;97;So, if in other stories you should hear;kirkpatrick
1;20;2665;98;some tale of how my city came to be,;kirkpatrick
1;20;2666;99;don’t let the truth, I urge, be mocked by lies.’;kirkpatrick
1;20;2667;100;‘Sir,’ I replied, ‘to me your words are sure,;kirkpatrick
1;20;2668;101;and capture so entirely what I think,;kirkpatrick
1;20;2669;102;that diﬀering versions are as burned-out coal.;kirkpatrick
1;20;2670;103;But let me know some more of this parade,;kirkpatrick
1;20;2671;104;that is, if any here still merit note.;kirkpatrick
1;20;2672;105;My mind is waiting only for that word.’;kirkpatrick
1;20;2673;106;And so he said: ‘The one who there fans wide;kirkpatrick
1;20;2674;107;his beard from cheek to shadowed shoulderblade,;kirkpatrick
1;20;2675;108;was – in those years when Greece was void of men,;kirkpatrick
1;20;2676;109;when, even in the cradle, boys were few –;kirkpatrick
1;20;2677;110;an augur. He, with Calchas, cast the hour;kirkpatrick
1;20;2678;111;at which to cut the anchor rope in Aulis.;kirkpatrick
1;20;2679;112;By name Eurypylus, there is some verse;kirkpatrick
1;20;2680;113;in my great tragedy that sings of him.;kirkpatrick
1;20;2681;114;But you’ll know where. You know the whole thing through.;kirkpatrick
1;20;2682;115;And then we meet, so withered in his ﬂanks,;kirkpatrick
1;20;2683;116;a certain Scotsman, Michael. In the spheres;kirkpatrick
1;20;2684;117;of fraud and magic, he was full of pranks.;kirkpatrick
1;20;2685;118;There’s Guido Bonatti. Look! Asdente, too!;kirkpatrick
1;20;2686;119;The cobbler must be wishing now he’d stuck;kirkpatrick
1;20;2687;120;to thread and leathers. Too late to repent.;kirkpatrick
1;20;2688;121;Then see those hags? They, one and all, forsook;kirkpatrick
1;20;2689;122;for witchcraft distaﬀ, needle, pin and spool.;kirkpatrick
1;20;2690;123;They cast their spells with weeds and ju-ju dolls.;kirkpatrick
1;20;2691;124;But come, now come. The zone where hemispheres;kirkpatrick
1;20;2692;125;both meet by now is gripped (and, under;kirkpatrick
1;20;2693;126;Seville, waves are touched) by Cain, his bush and thorns.;kirkpatrick
1;20;2694;127;And yestere’en the rounding moon was full.;kirkpatrick
1;20;2695;128;You must remember this. It shone while you,;kirkpatrick
1;20;2696;129;unharmed, were deep within that ﬁrst dark wood.’;kirkpatrick
1;20;2697;130;And so he chatted on and we fared forwards.;kirkpatrick
1;21;2698;1;So on we went from bridge to bridge, speaking;kirkpatrick
1;21;2699;2;of things that I shan’t, in my comedy,;kirkpatrick
1;21;2700;3;commit to song. We gained the brow. Once there,;kirkpatrick
1;21;2701;4;we paused and, down in Rottenpockets, saw;kirkpatrick
1;21;2702;5;another ﬁssure still, more empty tears.;kirkpatrick
1;21;2703;6;I saw it all – a marvel of mere dark.;kirkpatrick
1;21;2704;7;Compare: Venetians in their Arsenal,;kirkpatrick
1;21;2705;8;in winter when their ships cannot set sail,;kirkpatrick
1;21;2706;9;brew up a viscous pitch which they then smear;kirkpatrick
1;21;2707;10;on ailing boards, or else lay down new hulls.;kirkpatrick
1;21;2708;11;Others will plug the ribs of hulks that have,;kirkpatrick
1;21;2709;12;by now, made many a long-haul trip.;kirkpatrick
1;21;2710;13;Some hammer at the prow, some at the poop,;kirkpatrick
1;21;2711;14;some whittle oars, where others plait the rig.;kirkpatrick
1;21;2712;15;Some mend the mainsail, others patch the jib.;kirkpatrick
1;21;2713;16;So here – though more by art of God than ﬁre –;kirkpatrick
1;21;2714;17;a dense black gunge was brought to boiling point,;kirkpatrick
1;21;2715;18;and splashed on all the banks in sticky smears.;kirkpatrick
1;21;2716;19;I saw this stuﬀ but nothing else within;kirkpatrick
1;21;2717;20;but bubbles as the boiling bubbled on,;kirkpatrick
1;21;2718;21;swelling to roundness, glue-ily sinking in.;kirkpatrick
1;21;2719;22;In mesmerized amazement I just gazed.;kirkpatrick
1;21;2720;23;But then, ‘Look out! Look out!’ my leader cried,;kirkpatrick
1;21;2721;24;then dragged me, where I’d stood, towards his side.;kirkpatrick
1;21;2722;25;And there I turned as one who may well pause –;kirkpatrick
1;21;2723;26;all swagger, in his sudden panic, gone –;kirkpatrick
1;21;2724;27;to peep at what he really ought to ﬂee,;kirkpatrick
1;21;2725;28;yet, glimpsing this, does not delay his parting.;kirkpatrick
1;21;2726;29;I saw there, right behind us, this black demon;kirkpatrick
1;21;2727;30;running the ridge around in our direction.;kirkpatrick
1;21;2728;31;Eek! How ferocious all his features looked.;kirkpatrick
1;21;2729;32;How viciously his every move seemed etched,;kirkpatrick
1;21;2730;33;wings wide apart, so lithe and light of foot.;kirkpatrick
1;21;2731;34;The hunch blades of his shoulders, keen and proud,;kirkpatrick
1;21;2732;35;bore up the haunches of some criminal,;kirkpatrick
1;21;2733;36;his hook ﬁxed ﬁrm in tendons at each heel.;kirkpatrick
1;21;2734;37;Mounting our bridge, demonically he barked:;kirkpatrick
1;21;2735;38;‘Get this, Rotklors! A boss man from Lucca!;kirkpatrick
1;21;2736;39;You lot can dunk him. I’ll get back for more.;kirkpatrick
1;21;2737;40;I’ve got it stuﬀed, Saint Zita’s place, with this sort.;kirkpatrick
1;21;2738;41;They’re at it there, the lot. (Oh! Not Bonturo!);kirkpatrick
1;21;2739;42;Cash on the nail, and “no” becomes “for sure”.’;kirkpatrick
1;21;2740;43;Dumping his load, he then dashed down;kirkpatrick
1;21;2741;44;and crossed the ﬂinty slope. No mad bullmastiﬀ;kirkpatrick
1;21;2742;45;ever was loosed so fast to catch a thief.;kirkpatrick
1;21;2743;46;The sinner dived, but then turned, writhing up.;kirkpatrick
1;21;2744;47;At which the demons, dossing by that bridge,;kirkpatrick
1;21;2745;48;yelled: ‘No place, black face, here for black-faced gods.;kirkpatrick
1;21;2746;49;You can’t swim here like bathers in the Serchio.;kirkpatrick
1;21;2747;50;If you don’t want to know what hooks can do,;kirkpatrick
1;21;2748;51;then just don’t poke your nose above that tar.’;kirkpatrick
1;21;2749;52;They sank in him a hundred barbs or more.;kirkpatrick
1;21;2750;53;‘Down here,’ they sang, ‘you’ll tango in the dark!;kirkpatrick
1;21;2751;54;Get under cover! Pull what scams you can!’;kirkpatrick
1;21;2752;55;Chefs do the same. They get their kitchen boys;kirkpatrick
1;21;2753;56;to fork the centre of a simmering pot,;kirkpatrick
1;21;2754;57;so chunks of meat do not ﬂoat up too high.;kirkpatrick
1;21;2755;58;Here, too. ‘Seem not to be here,’ Sir now said.;kirkpatrick
1;21;2756;59;‘Just hunker down behind a spur of rock.;kirkpatrick
1;21;2757;60;It may still oﬀer you some place to hide.;kirkpatrick
1;21;2758;61;Yet have no fear. Oppose me as they may,;kirkpatrick
1;21;2759;62;my strategy – I know what’s what – is clear.;kirkpatrick
1;21;2760;63;I’ve been involved in rucks like this before.’;kirkpatrick
1;21;2761;64;So now, beyond the bridge head, on he went,;kirkpatrick
1;21;2762;65;and needed, when he neared Embankment Six,;kirkpatrick
1;21;2763;66;the steadiest front that he could summon up.;kirkpatrick
1;21;2764;67;With all the fury and tempestuous rage;kirkpatrick
1;21;2765;68;of dog packs rushing on some poor old tramp –;kirkpatrick
1;21;2766;69;who freezes there and pleads from where he’d reached –;kirkpatrick
1;21;2767;70;so now those demons underneath the arch;kirkpatrick
1;21;2768;71;stormed out at him and brandished all their hooks.;kirkpatrick
1;21;2769;72;But he cried out: ‘Don’t even think of it.;kirkpatrick
1;21;2770;73;Before you set on me with curving prongs,;kirkpatrick
1;21;2771;74;let one of you who’ll hear me out draw near,;kirkpatrick
1;21;2772;75;and then discuss if hooking me is right or wrong.’;kirkpatrick
1;21;2773;76;So, ‘Go on, Rottentail,’ they shrieked. ‘That’s you!’;kirkpatrick
1;21;2774;77;And he advanced (the others kept their ground;kirkpatrick
1;21;2775;78;and muttered: ‘What will he get out of it?’);kirkpatrick
1;21;2776;79;‘Do you imagine, Rottentail,’ my teacher said,;kirkpatrick
1;21;2777;80;‘who’ve seen me come already once, immune;kirkpatrick
1;21;2778;81;to all your tricks, that I am here without;kirkpatrick
1;21;2779;82;the favouring aid of fate or will divine?;kirkpatrick
1;21;2780;83;Let us pass on. For Heaven wills that I;kirkpatrick
1;21;2781;84;should guide another on the savage way.’;kirkpatrick
1;21;2782;85;His arrogance at this took such a fall;kirkpatrick
1;21;2783;86;he let his hook slip, dangling, to his heels.;kirkpatrick
1;21;2784;87;‘OK,’ he told the others, ‘let’s not cut him.’;kirkpatrick
1;21;2785;88;And now my leader turned and said: ‘O thou;kirkpatrick
1;21;2786;89;who sittest there, squatting by that splintered bridge,;kirkpatrick
1;21;2787;90;return to me with conﬁdence renewed.’;kirkpatrick
1;21;2788;91;So shift I did, and reached him speedily.;kirkpatrick
1;21;2789;92;At which the demons all came pressing forwards –;kirkpatrick
1;21;2790;93;so I could not be sure they’d keep their word.;kirkpatrick
1;21;2791;94;In this way, at Caprona once I saw;kirkpatrick
1;21;2792;95;the infantry come edging out, despite;kirkpatrick
1;21;2793;96;safe conduct, chary of the hordes around.;kirkpatrick
1;21;2794;97;Huddled against my leader’s side, pressed hard;kirkpatrick
1;21;2795;98;along him, head to toe, I could not wrench;kirkpatrick
1;21;2796;99;my eyes from them. Their looks did not look good.;kirkpatrick
1;21;2797;100;They cocked their barbs. Then one spoke out:;kirkpatrick
1;21;2798;101;‘Want me to touch him on his fat backside?’;kirkpatrick
1;21;2799;102;And they replied: ‘Yeah, get him in the notch.’;kirkpatrick
1;21;2800;103;But then that devil who was still in speech;kirkpatrick
1;21;2801;104;with my great leader swung around at speed,;kirkpatrick
1;21;2802;105;and said: ‘Just cool it, cool it, Tangletop!’;kirkpatrick
1;21;2803;106;‘Further along this crag,’ he now declared,;kirkpatrick
1;21;2804;107;‘you just can’t go. Bridge Six is broken down.;kirkpatrick
1;21;2805;108;It lies in ruins on the valley ﬂoor.;kirkpatrick
1;21;2806;109;But if you’d care to schlepp still further on,;kirkpatrick
1;21;2807;110;then do so round this arching cliﬀ. Nearby,;kirkpatrick
1;21;2808;111;another outcrop makes a path for you.;kirkpatrick
1;21;2809;112;Just yesterday (ﬁve hours ahead of now),;kirkpatrick
1;21;2810;113;a thousand years, two centuries and sixty-six;kirkpatrick
1;21;2811;114;from when the path was cut had then elapsed.;kirkpatrick
1;21;2812;115;I’ll send in that direction some of mine,;kirkpatrick
1;21;2813;116;to watch for any sinner scenting air.;kirkpatrick
1;21;2814;117;You go with them. They won’t dare pull a stunt.’;kirkpatrick
1;21;2815;118;‘So, forward, Crackice! Forward, Flash Ali!’;kirkpatrick
1;21;2816;119;so he began: ‘And Baddog! You as well.;kirkpatrick
1;21;2817;120;And you, old Twirlitufts, can lead the squad.;kirkpatrick
1;21;2818;121;Loveslot as well. And you, too, Dragonrunt,;kirkpatrick
1;21;2819;122;Bigpig with tusks, and also Skratcherker,;kirkpatrick
1;21;2820;123;Flutterby! For’ard! And you there, mad Glogob!;kirkpatrick
1;21;2821;124;Search all around this pan of boiling lime:;kirkpatrick
1;21;2822;125;until you reach the spur that arcs, unbroken,;kirkpatrick
1;21;2823;126;over these dens, these two will go unharmed.’;kirkpatrick
1;21;2824;127;‘Sir, sir,’ I said, ‘what’s this I see! Please, sir,;kirkpatrick
1;21;2825;128;if you know how and where, let’s go alone.;kirkpatrick
1;21;2826;129;Myself, I didn’t ask for this at all.;kirkpatrick
1;21;2827;130;Your eyes are usually so very keen.;kirkpatrick
1;21;2828;131;Can you not see? Just look! They grind their teeth.;kirkpatrick
1;21;2829;132;Their frowns are warnings of what harm they mean.’;kirkpatrick
1;21;2830;133;His answer was: ‘I wouldn’t have you frightened.;kirkpatrick
1;21;2831;134;Let them scowl so, and grind as they may choose.;kirkpatrick
1;21;2832;135;They mean it for the souls in this sad stew.’;kirkpatrick
1;21;2833;136;About-face, leftwards on the rocky pass,;kirkpatrick
1;21;2834;137;each poked a tongue, teeth clenched, towards their lord,;kirkpatrick
1;21;2835;138;and he – to give the order now, ‘Quick march!’ –  in;kirkpatrick
1;21;2836;139;answer made a trumpet of his arse.;kirkpatrick
1;22;2837;1;I, in my time, have seen brave knights strike camp,;kirkpatrick
1;22;2838;2;parade their power, launch an attack, and then,;kirkpatrick
1;22;2839;3;at times, to save their skins, desert the ﬁeld.;kirkpatrick
1;22;2840;4;Yes, you, Aretines, I have seen our cavalry;kirkpatrick
1;22;2841;5;charge through your heartland. Skirmishes I’ve seen, cutand-thrust tournaments and running duels,;kirkpatrick
1;22;2842;6;all to the sound of horns (at times) or bells,;kirkpatrick
1;22;2843;7;to beating drums or signals ﬂashed from ramparts,;kirkpatrick
1;22;2844;8;devices of our own and more exotic signs.;kirkpatrick
1;22;2845;9;Yet never to so weird a pipe or whistle;kirkpatrick
1;22;2846;10;have I, till now, seen foot or horse fall in,;kirkpatrick
1;22;2847;11;nor ship set sail to signs like that, from land or star.;kirkpatrick
1;22;2848;12;So, on we went, ﬁve friends on either side.;kirkpatrick
1;22;2849;13;What fearsome company! Well, that’s the way it is:;kirkpatrick
1;22;2850;14;hobnob in church with saints, in pubs with sots.;kirkpatrick
1;22;2851;15;The tar pit called for all my concentration;kirkpatrick
1;22;2852;16;to note each facet of this rotten hole,;kirkpatrick
1;22;2853;17;and also of the persons burning there.;kirkpatrick
1;22;2854;18;As schools of dolphin when they arch their spines;kirkpatrick
1;22;2855;19;provide a signal to the mariner,;kirkpatrick
1;22;2856;20;to say the ship should soon be steered back home,  so;kirkpatrick
1;22;2857;21;too from time to time, to ease their pain,;kirkpatrick
1;22;2858;22;a sinner gave his back some air, then quick;kirkpatrick
1;22;2859;23;as any lightning ﬂash would hide again.;kirkpatrick
1;22;2860;24;Likewise, in ditches at the water’s edge,;kirkpatrick
1;22;2861;25;bullfrogs will stand, their snouts alone on show, their feet;kirkpatrick
1;22;2862;26;concealed, with all their bulk below.;kirkpatrick
1;22;2863;27;In this same way, these sinners lolled around.;kirkpatrick
1;22;2864;28;But then, whenever Twirlitufts came past,;kirkpatrick
1;22;2865;29;they swiftly dived beneath the bubbling crust.;kirkpatrick
1;22;2866;30;I saw – at this, my heart still skips a beat –;kirkpatrick
1;22;2867;31;that one (as happens when a frog school springs,;kirkpatrick
1;22;2868;32;but one stays dallying) was left behind.;kirkpatrick
1;22;2869;33;And Skratcherker – as being nearest to him –;kirkpatrick
1;22;2870;34;enmeshed his hook among those tar-caked locks;kirkpatrick
1;22;2871;35;and yanked him out like any ﬂoppy otter.;kirkpatrick
1;22;2872;36;I knew them all by name, the lot of them.;kirkpatrick
1;22;2873;37;I’d noted each when they were ﬁrst enrolled,;kirkpatrick
1;22;2874;38;and then, between them, heard them call out names.;kirkpatrick
1;22;2875;39;‘Get in there, Glogob! Get him with your hook!’;kirkpatrick
1;22;2876;40;(So, in damned unison, the chorus shrieked.);kirkpatrick
1;22;2877;41;‘And tear the leather oﬀ his ugly rump!’;kirkpatrick
1;22;2878;42;I turned, and to my master said: ‘Find out,;kirkpatrick
1;22;2879;43;if you can manage it: who is that so-and-so;kirkpatrick
1;22;2880;44;who’s fallen foul of these antagonists?’;kirkpatrick
1;22;2881;45;My leader went, and stood beside him there,;kirkpatrick
1;22;2882;46;wanting to know the place where he was born.;kirkpatrick
1;22;2883;47;He answered: ‘I’m a native of Navarre.;kirkpatrick
1;22;2884;48;My mother, having borne me to a lout,;kirkpatrick
1;22;2885;49;who brought himself and all he had to ruin,;kirkpatrick
1;22;2886;50;engaged me to the service of a nobleman.;kirkpatrick
1;22;2887;51;And then I joined King Thibaut’s retinue,;kirkpatrick
1;22;2888;52;to practise arts of chartered bribery.;kirkpatrick
1;22;2889;53;For which I pay my dues in this great heat.’;kirkpatrick
1;22;2890;54;Then Bigpig, with his boar-like jowls – a tusk;kirkpatrick
1;22;2891;55;stuck out from both his cheeks – supplied a sip;kirkpatrick
1;22;2892;56;of how well one of these could rake and rip.;kirkpatrick
1;22;2893;57;The mouse had got among the bad cats now.;kirkpatrick
1;22;2894;58;But Twirlitufts enclosed him in his arms.;kirkpatrick
1;22;2895;59;‘Stay over there!’ he said. ‘I’ll keep him pinned.’;kirkpatrick
1;22;2896;60;He tilted up his face towards my guide:;kirkpatrick
1;22;2897;61;‘Go on, then. Ask him, if you want still more.;kirkpatrick
1;22;2898;62;But quick,’ he said, ‘before they do him in.’;kirkpatrick
1;22;2899;63;‘So tell me, then,’ my master now went on,;kirkpatrick
1;22;2900;64;‘among the criminals beneath the tar,;kirkpatrick
1;22;2901;65;are any – can you tell? – Italian?’ ‘Just now,’;kirkpatrick
1;22;2902;66;he answered me, ‘I left a man from there.;kirkpatrick
1;22;2903;67;If only I were with him still beneath the lid,;kirkpatrick
1;22;2904;68;I wouldn’t need to dread these hooks and claws.’;kirkpatrick
1;22;2905;69;‘We’ve taken quite enough of this!’ So said;kirkpatrick
1;22;2906;70;the Loveslot. Skewering an arm, he sliced;kirkpatrick
1;22;2907;71;a muscle out in one long hookful.;kirkpatrick
1;22;2908;72;Then Dragonrunt must also have a go.;kirkpatrick
1;22;2909;73;He ogled the ham. But their decurion;kirkpatrick
1;22;2910;74;swung round and gave them all a ﬁlthy frown.;kirkpatrick
1;22;2911;75;Then, just a little, they all settled down.;kirkpatrick
1;22;2912;76;The sinner lay there, wondering at his wound.;kirkpatrick
1;22;2913;77;My lord without delay now turned and asked:;kirkpatrick
1;22;2914;78;‘Who was the one from whom, you say, you took,;kirkpatrick
1;22;2915;79;ill-fatedly, your leave to reach this shore?’;kirkpatrick
1;22;2916;80;‘Brother – as was – Gomita!’ he replied.;kirkpatrick
1;22;2917;81;‘Sard from Gallura, vessel of deceit!;kirkpatrick
1;22;2918;82;Palming (well-greased) his sire’s worst enemies,;kirkpatrick
1;22;2919;83;he treated all so well, each sang his praise.;kirkpatrick
1;22;2920;84;He took their cash, then let them oﬀ the hook.;kirkpatrick
1;22;2921;85;In this – as he’ll admit – and everything;kirkpatrick
1;22;2922;86;a total crook. Not small time, though. The King!;kirkpatrick
1;22;2923;87;Don Michael Zanche, from the Logudor,;kirkpatrick
1;22;2924;88;still hangs around with him. Their tongues don’t tire of;kirkpatrick
1;22;2925;89;banging on about “Sardin-i-ah”.;kirkpatrick
1;22;2926;90;Ow! Look at how that demon grinds his teeth.;kirkpatrick
1;22;2927;91;I could tell more but (oh! I’m terriﬁed!);kirkpatrick
1;22;2928;92;he means to come and give my scabs a scrub!’;kirkpatrick
1;22;2929;93;The high commander swung on Flutterby,;kirkpatrick
1;22;2930;94;whose moon eyes popped in eagerness to pounce.;kirkpatrick
1;22;2931;95;‘Butt out!’ he hissed. ‘You vulture! Over there!’;kirkpatrick
1;22;2932;96;Witless with fear, he started once again:;kirkpatrick
1;22;2933;97;‘If you would witness or hold audience;kirkpatrick
1;22;2934;98;with Lombards or Tuscans, I can make them come.;kirkpatrick
1;22;2935;99;But let these Rotklors all stand well aside –;kirkpatrick
1;22;2936;100;and no one need be frightened they’ll attack –;kirkpatrick
1;22;2937;101;while I, just sitting on this self-same spot,;kirkpatrick
1;22;2938;102;will whistle. Now I’m here alone. Presto!;kirkpatrick
1;22;2939;103;And now we’re seven! That’s our usual trick;kirkpatrick
1;22;2940;104;when any from below gets out of it.’;kirkpatrick
1;22;2941;105;Hearing this blag, old Baddog twitched his snout,;kirkpatrick
1;22;2942;106;then shook his head and snarled: ‘The little demon!;kirkpatrick
1;22;2943;107;He means to take a dive and get back in.’;kirkpatrick
1;22;2944;108;That sinner up his sleeve had snares galore.;kirkpatrick
1;22;2945;109;‘O yeah! That’s me,’ he said. ‘A demon! Sure!;kirkpatrick
1;22;2946;110;Really? You think I’d bring my gang more grief?’;kirkpatrick
1;22;2947;111;Flash Ali, at these words, could not hold back.;kirkpatrick
1;22;2948;112;Despite what his companions thought, ‘Go on,’;kirkpatrick
1;22;2949;113;he said. ‘Slope oﬀ. I’ll not come galloping.;kirkpatrick
1;22;2950;114;I will, though, stretch my wings across the pitch.;kirkpatrick
1;22;2951;115;Let’s leave the ridge. Let’s make the slope our screen.;kirkpatrick
1;22;2952;116;And then we’ll see if you can get oﬀ clean.’;kirkpatrick
1;22;2953;117;O you there, as you read! Get this! Olympics!;kirkpatrick
1;22;2954;118;They all then turned to face the other bank,;kirkpatrick
1;22;2955;119;even the one who ﬁrst was most reluctant.;kirkpatrick
1;22;2956;120;The Navarrese chose his moment well.;kirkpatrick
1;22;2957;121;Feet ﬁrmly planted, in a single ﬂash,;kirkpatrick
1;22;2958;122;he’d leapt and gone, scot-free of their intent.;kirkpatrick
1;22;2959;123;At this, the lot of them were pierced by guilt.;kirkpatrick
1;22;2960;124;Yet, undeterred, the devil most at fault;kirkpatrick
1;22;2961;125;drove onwards. ‘Now you’re for it!’ he yelled out.;kirkpatrick
1;22;2962;126;To no avail. No wing could overhaul;kirkpatrick
1;22;2963;127;the speed of fear. The sinner plunged. Square on, the;kirkpatrick
1;22;2964;128;demon baulked and then shot up again.;kirkpatrick
1;22;2965;129;So, too, a rapid duck dives down, glimpsing;kirkpatrick
1;22;2966;130;a falcon closing in. The duck’s foe then;kirkpatrick
1;22;2967;131;returns aloft, bitter in thwarted pique.;kirkpatrick
1;22;2968;132;Crackice, still seething at the doublecross,;kirkpatrick
1;22;2969;133;zoomed ever onwards in his yen to see;kirkpatrick
1;22;2970;134;the sinner free – then mix it with Flash Ali.;kirkpatrick
1;22;2971;135;So, since the barrator had long since gone,;kirkpatrick
1;22;2972;136;he turned his talons on his own best mate.;kirkpatrick
1;22;2973;137;Above the ditch he locked him in his prongs.;kirkpatrick
1;22;2974;138;The other, though, a right old sparrowhawk,;kirkpatrick
1;22;2975;139;returned the hook. And so the two of them,;kirkpatrick
1;22;2976;140;as one, went tumbling to the boiling pond.;kirkpatrick
1;22;2977;141;The heat that instant made them come unhitched.;kirkpatrick
1;22;2978;142;But, even so, they couldn’t raise a thing,;kirkpatrick
1;22;2979;143;so tightly glued together were their wings.;kirkpatrick
1;22;2980;144;Then Twirlitufts, condoling with his kin,;kirkpatrick
1;22;2981;145;sent four of them towards the inner rim,;kirkpatrick
1;22;2982;146;with all their grappling tackle, at top speed.;kirkpatrick
1;22;2983;147;This side and that they went to take their posts,;kirkpatrick
1;22;2984;148;and bent their hooks towards those two, stuck fast.;kirkpatrick
1;22;2985;149;By now they both were crisped within the batter.;kirkpatrick
1;22;2986;150;With that entanglement, we left the matter.;kirkpatrick
1;23;2987;1;Silent, alone with no one now beside us,;kirkpatrick
1;23;2988;2;we went our way – the one behind, the other;kirkpatrick
1;23;2989;3;leading on – walking as meek Franciscans do.;kirkpatrick
1;23;2990;4;My mind turned (thinking of that scuﬄe still);kirkpatrick
1;23;2991;5;to Aesop and his fables, most of all;kirkpatrick
1;23;2992;6;the one about the frog and rat and hawk.;kirkpatrick
1;23;2993;7;For ‘now’ and ‘noo’ are hardly more alike;kirkpatrick
1;23;2994;8;than this ﬁne mess to that – if parallels;kirkpatrick
1;23;2995;9;are rightly drawn between the start and ﬁnish.;kirkpatrick
1;23;2996;10;But thoughts pop up and then lead on to more.;kirkpatrick
1;23;2997;11;So from this ﬁrst a further set was born,;kirkpatrick
1;23;2998;12;which now redoubled all my earlier fears.;kirkpatrick
1;23;2999;13;‘Because of us,’ the sequence ran, ‘that lot;kirkpatrick
1;23;3000;14;have been so injured, put on, tricked and scorned, they;kirkpatrick
1;23;3001;15;cannot fail, I think, to be upset.;kirkpatrick
1;23;3002;16;Suppose their bile gets tangled now with anger,;kirkpatrick
1;23;3003;17;then surely they’ll come after us and snarl;kirkpatrick
1;23;3004;18;more viciously than dogs that snout a hare.’;kirkpatrick
1;23;3005;19;I felt already that my every curl;kirkpatrick
1;23;3006;20;was bristling, on its end. So, gazing back,;kirkpatrick
1;23;3007;21;stock still, I said: ‘If you, sir, do not hide;kirkpatrick
1;23;3008;22;yourself this second, me as well…I dread;kirkpatrick
1;23;3009;23;the Rotklors gang. They’re not now far behind.;kirkpatrick
1;23;3010;24;I hear them now, imagine it, quite clear.’;kirkpatrick
1;23;3011;25;‘If I,’ he said, ‘were leaded mirror glass,;kirkpatrick
1;23;3012;26;I could not make your outer image mine;kirkpatrick
1;23;3013;27;more swiftly than I grasp your inward stress.;kirkpatrick
1;23;3014;28;Your thoughts just now came in upon my own,;kirkpatrick
1;23;3015;29;in bearing similar, and look as well.;kirkpatrick
1;23;3016;30;These, all together, formed a single plan.;kirkpatrick
1;23;3017;31;Suppose that, on the right, the incline’s such;kirkpatrick
1;23;3018;32;that we can reach the pocket there beyond,;kirkpatrick
1;23;3019;33;we shall elude the hunt we now imagine.’;kirkpatrick
1;23;3020;34;No sooner had he oﬀered up this thought;kirkpatrick
1;23;3021;35;than, coming after us, I saw them, wings;kirkpatrick
1;23;3022;36;stretched wide, now closer, meaning to get us.;kirkpatrick
1;23;3023;37;My leader in an instant caught me up.;kirkpatrick
1;23;3024;38;A mother, likewise, wakened by some noise,;kirkpatrick
1;23;3025;39;who sees the ﬂames – and sees them burning closer –;kirkpatrick
1;23;3026;40;will snatch her son and ﬂee and will not pause,;kirkpatrick
1;23;3027;41;caring less keenly for herself than him,;kirkpatrick
1;23;3028;42;to pull her shift or undershirt around her.;kirkpatrick
1;23;3029;43;Down from the collar of that circling rock,;kirkpatrick
1;23;3030;44;backwards he launched himself, and met the slope that;kirkpatrick
1;23;3031;45;forms a bung against the other trench.;kirkpatrick
1;23;3032;46;No mill race ever ran through any sluice;kirkpatrick
1;23;3033;47;at such velocity, or streamed to meet;kirkpatrick
1;23;3034;48;the scoops that drive, on land, the grinding stone,  as;kirkpatrick
1;23;3035;49;now my master slithered down that verge,;kirkpatrick
1;23;3036;50;bearing me with him, bound upon his breast,;kirkpatrick
1;23;3037;51;as though I were his son and no mere friend.;kirkpatrick
1;23;3038;52;And hardly had his feet touched down to meet;kirkpatrick
1;23;3039;53;the pocket ﬂoor than those were at the summit,;kirkpatrick
1;23;3040;54;over us. We need have had no worries.;kirkpatrick
1;23;3041;55;For that exalted providence that chose;kirkpatrick
1;23;3042;56;such ministers to guard Ditch Five also;kirkpatrick
1;23;3043;57;deprived them of the power to ever leave.;kirkpatrick
1;23;3044;58;We found, down there, a people painted bright.;kirkpatrick
1;23;3045;59;Their tread, as round they went, was very slow,;kirkpatrick
1;23;3046;60;weeping, worn down and seemingly defeated.;kirkpatrick
1;23;3047;61;They all wore robes with hoods hung low, that hid;kirkpatrick
1;23;3048;62;their eyes, tailored – in cut – to match those worn by;kirkpatrick
1;23;3049;63;monks who thrive in Benedictine Cluny.;kirkpatrick
1;23;3050;64;So gilded outwardly, they dazed the eye.;kirkpatrick
1;23;3051;65;Within, these robes were all of lead – so heavy;kirkpatrick
1;23;3052;66;those capes that melt in torture would have seemed mere;kirkpatrick
1;23;3053;67;straw.;kirkpatrick
1;23;3054;68;What labour to eternity to wear such dress!;kirkpatrick
1;23;3055;69;We took once more the leftward path along;kirkpatrick
1;23;3056;70;with them, intent on their distress and tears.;kirkpatrick
1;23;3057;71;Because, though, of the labouring weight they bore,;kirkpatrick
1;23;3058;72;these weary folk came on so slow that we,;kirkpatrick
1;23;3059;73;at every hip swing, joined new company.;kirkpatrick
1;23;3060;74;‘Do all you can’ – I put this to my guide –;kirkpatrick
1;23;3061;75;‘to ﬁnd here someone known by name or deed.;kirkpatrick
1;23;3062;76;As we move onward, scan around to see.’;kirkpatrick
1;23;3063;77;Then one who’d recognized my Tuscan words;kirkpatrick
1;23;3064;78;from close behind yelled out: ‘You! Racing there through;kirkpatrick
1;23;3065;79;all this murky air, just ease your stride.;kirkpatrick
1;23;3066;80;You’ll get, perhaps, from me what you desire.’;kirkpatrick
1;23;3067;81;At this my leader turned. And, ‘Wait,’ he said,;kirkpatrick
1;23;3068;82;‘then follow forwards at the pace he sets.’;kirkpatrick
1;23;3069;83;I stopped and saw there two who, from their look,;kirkpatrick
1;23;3070;84;(though hampered by their load and narrow footings) in;kirkpatrick
1;23;3071;85;mind were speeding on to reach my side.;kirkpatrick
1;23;3072;86;At last, they caught me up. With eyes a-squint,;kirkpatrick
1;23;3073;87;they gazed at me in wonder, spoke no word,;kirkpatrick
1;23;3074;88;till muttering they turned and, each to each:;kirkpatrick
1;23;3075;89;‘This one, it seems – Just see his throat! It ﬂicks! –;kirkpatrick
1;23;3076;90;is still alive. If dead, why favoured so,;kirkpatrick
1;23;3077;91;to go uncovered by a weighty cloak?’;kirkpatrick
1;23;3078;92;And then to me direct they said: ‘Tuscan,;kirkpatrick
1;23;3079;93;you’ve reached the college of the hypocrites.;kirkpatrick
1;23;3080;94;Do not disdain to say who you might be.’;kirkpatrick
1;23;3081;95;‘Born,’ I replied, ‘by the lovely Arno,;kirkpatrick
1;23;3082;96;grown in the city that adorns its banks,;kirkpatrick
1;23;3083;97;I still am in the limbs I’ve always worn.;kirkpatrick
1;23;3084;98;But who are you, in whom, as I can see,;kirkpatrick
1;23;3085;99;great pain distils such tears upon your cheeks?;kirkpatrick
1;23;3086;100;What punishment strikes out these sparks from you?’;kirkpatrick
1;23;3087;101;And one replied to me: ‘These orange robes;kirkpatrick
1;23;3088;102;are thick with such a quantity of lead,;kirkpatrick
1;23;3089;103;the weight of them would make a balance creak.;kirkpatrick
1;23;3090;104;We’re good-time friars, Bolognese both.;kirkpatrick
1;23;3091;105;Our names? I’m Catalano. Loderingo’s there,;kirkpatrick
1;23;3092;106;captured together in that town of yours –;kirkpatrick
1;23;3093;107;although, by custom, there is one alone;kirkpatrick
1;23;3094;108;whose mandate is to keep the peace. Our doings;kirkpatrick
1;23;3095;109;still appear around the Watch, for such we were.’;kirkpatrick
1;23;3096;110;I then began: ‘O brothers! All the harm that you…’;kirkpatrick
1;23;3097;111;but said no more. Straight to my sight, there sped one;kirkpatrick
1;23;3098;112;cruciﬁed. Three staves ﬁxed him to earth.;kirkpatrick
1;23;3099;113;And he, on seeing me, writhed all around;kirkpatrick
1;23;3100;114;and ﬂuﬀed his beard up with the sighs he heaved.;kirkpatrick
1;23;3101;115;Then brother Catalan, who saw all this,;kirkpatrick
1;23;3102;116;revealed to me: ‘This ﬁgure, staked, whom you;kirkpatrick
1;23;3103;117;so wonder at, advised the Pharisees;kirkpatrick
1;23;3104;118;that one man suﬀer for the sake of all.;kirkpatrick
1;23;3105;119;Across the road, stretched naked, as you see,;kirkpatrick
1;23;3106;120;he ﬁrst must feel, whoever passes by,;kirkpatrick
1;23;3107;121;the toiling weight of those who come this way.;kirkpatrick
1;23;3108;122;Here too lies Annas – father of his wife –;kirkpatrick
1;23;3109;123;racked in this ditch with others of that house;kirkpatrick
1;23;3110;124;that proved an evil seed bed for the Jews.’;kirkpatrick
1;23;3111;125;Virgil, I saw, just stood there marvelling,;kirkpatrick
1;23;3112;126;bending above that ﬁgure on the cross,;kirkpatrick
1;23;3113;127;eternally in ignominious exile.;kirkpatrick
1;23;3114;128;But then, towards the friar he voiced: ‘Please say;kirkpatrick
1;23;3115;129;(though not to trouble you), if you’re allowed,;kirkpatrick
1;23;3116;130;is there some outlet lying to the right;kirkpatrick
1;23;3117;131;through which the two of us can make our way;kirkpatrick
1;23;3118;132;without the need to call black angels here,;kirkpatrick
1;23;3119;133;who might come down to further our departure?’;kirkpatrick
1;23;3120;134;‘Far sooner than you hope,’ the answer was,;kirkpatrick
1;23;3121;135;‘we’ll near a rock that, jutting from the Ring,;kirkpatrick
1;23;3122;136;vaults over all these savage valley ﬂoors –;kirkpatrick
1;23;3123;137;except it’s broken here and forms no covering.;kirkpatrick
1;23;3124;138;You can, though, clamber up the ruined side.;kirkpatrick
1;23;3125;139;The slope is gentle and the base piled high.’;kirkpatrick
1;23;3126;140;My leader stood a moment, head hung down.;kirkpatrick
1;23;3127;141;And then he said: ‘He gave a false account,;kirkpatrick
1;23;3128;142;that hooker-up of sinners over there.’;kirkpatrick
1;23;3129;143;‘I, in Bologna,’ so the friar said, ‘have heard;kirkpatrick
1;23;3130;144;a good few stories told of devil vice,;kirkpatrick
1;23;3131;145;not least “Old Nick’s a liar – falsehood’s dad”.’;kirkpatrick
1;23;3132;146;At this, with lengthened pace, my lord strode oﬀ,;kirkpatrick
1;23;3133;147;clear signs of anger ﬂitting on his face.;kirkpatrick
1;23;3134;148;And so I left these beings with their loads;kirkpatrick
1;23;3135;149;to follow in the prints of his dear feet.;kirkpatrick
1;24;3136;1;In that still baby-boyish time of year,;kirkpatrick
1;24;3137;2;when sunlight chills its curls beneath Aquarius, when;kirkpatrick
1;24;3138;3;nights grow shorter equalling the day,;kirkpatrick
1;24;3139;4;and hoar frost writes fair copies on the ground;kirkpatrick
1;24;3140;5;to mimic in design its snowy sister;kirkpatrick
1;24;3141;6;(its pen, though, not chill-tempered to endure),  the;kirkpatrick
1;24;3142;7;peasant in this season, when supplies;kirkpatrick
1;24;3143;8;run short, rolls from his bed, looks out and sees the ﬁelds;kirkpatrick
1;24;3144;9;are glistening white, so slaps his thigh,  goes in, then;kirkpatrick
1;24;3145;10;grumbles up and down, as though;kirkpatrick
1;24;3146;11;(poor sod) he couldn’t ﬁnd a thing to do,;kirkpatrick
1;24;3147;12;till, out once more, he ﬁlls his wicker trug,;kirkpatrick
1;24;3148;13;with hope, at least. No time at all! The features;kirkpatrick
1;24;3149;14;of the world transform. He grabs his goad.;kirkpatrick
1;24;3150;15;Outdoors, he prods his lambs to open pasture.;kirkpatrick
1;24;3151;16;In some such way, I too was ﬁrst dismayed;kirkpatrick
1;24;3152;17;to see distress so written on my leader’s brow.;kirkpatrick
1;24;3153;18;But he, as quickly, plastered up the hurt.;kirkpatrick
1;24;3154;19;And so, arriving at the ruined bridge,;kirkpatrick
1;24;3155;20;my leader turned that sour-sweet look on me;kirkpatrick
1;24;3156;21;that ﬁrst he’d shown me at the mountain foot.;kirkpatrick
1;24;3157;22;He spread his arms, then, having in his thought;kirkpatrick
1;24;3158;23;surveyed the landslip, and (a man of sense);kirkpatrick
1;24;3159;24;assessed it well, he took me in his grip.;kirkpatrick
1;24;3160;25;Then, always with adjustments in his moves;kirkpatrick
1;24;3161;26;(so that, it seemed, he foresaw everything),;kirkpatrick
1;24;3162;27;in hauling me towards the pinnacle;kirkpatrick
1;24;3163;28;of one moraine, he’d see a spur beyond;kirkpatrick
1;24;3164;29;and say: ‘Next, take your hold on that niche there.;kirkpatrick
1;24;3165;30;But test it ﬁrst to see how well it bears.’;kirkpatrick
1;24;3166;31;This was no route for someone warmly dressed.;kirkpatrick
1;24;3167;32;Even for us – he, weightless, shoving me –;kirkpatrick
1;24;3168;33;we hardly could progress from ledge to ledge.;kirkpatrick
1;24;3169;34;Had not the gradient been less severe;kirkpatrick
1;24;3170;35;than that which faced it on the other side,;kirkpatrick
1;24;3171;36;I’d have been beat. I cannot speak for him.;kirkpatrick
1;24;3172;37;But Rottenpockets slopes towards the ﬂap;kirkpatrick
1;24;3173;38;that opens on the lowest sump of all,;kirkpatrick
1;24;3174;39;and so, in contour, every ditch is shaped;kirkpatrick
1;24;3175;40;with one rim proud, the other dipping down.;kirkpatrick
1;24;3176;41;So, in the end, we came upon the point;kirkpatrick
1;24;3177;42;where one last building block had sheared away.;kirkpatrick
1;24;3178;43;My lungs by now had so been milked of breath;kirkpatrick
1;24;3179;44;that, come so far, I couldn’t make it further.;kirkpatrick
1;24;3180;45;I ﬂopped, in fact, when we arrived, just there.;kirkpatrick
1;24;3181;46;‘Now you must needs,’ my teacher said, ‘shake oﬀ;kirkpatrick
1;24;3182;47;your wonted indolence. No fame is won;kirkpatrick
1;24;3183;48;beneath the quilt or sunk in feather cushions.;kirkpatrick
1;24;3184;49;Whoever, fameless, wastes his life away,;kirkpatrick
1;24;3185;50;leaves of himself no greater mark on earth;kirkpatrick
1;24;3186;51;than smoke in air or froth upon the wave.;kirkpatrick
1;24;3187;52;So upwards! On! And vanquish laboured breath!;kirkpatrick
1;24;3188;53;In any battle mind-power will prevail,;kirkpatrick
1;24;3189;54;unless the weight of body loads it down.;kirkpatrick
1;24;3190;55;There’s yet a longer ladder you must scale.;kirkpatrick
1;24;3191;56;You can’t just turn and leave all these behind.;kirkpatrick
1;24;3192;57;You understand? Well, make my words avail.’;kirkpatrick
1;24;3193;58;So up I got, pretending to more puﬀ;kirkpatrick
1;24;3194;59;than, really, I could feel I’d got within.;kirkpatrick
1;24;3195;60;‘Let’s go,’ I answered, ‘I’m all strength and dash.’;kirkpatrick
1;24;3196;61;Upwards we made our way, along the cliﬀ –;kirkpatrick
1;24;3197;62;poor, narrow-going where the rocks jut out,;kirkpatrick
1;24;3198;63;far steeper than the slope had been before.;kirkpatrick
1;24;3199;64;Talking (to seem less feeble) on I went,;kirkpatrick
1;24;3200;65;when, issuing from the ditch beyond, there came;kirkpatrick
1;24;3201;66;a voice – though one unﬁt for human words.;kirkpatrick
1;24;3202;67;I made no sense of it. But now I neared;kirkpatrick
1;24;3203;68;the arch that forms a span across that pocket.;kirkpatrick
1;24;3204;69;The speaker seemed much moved by raging ire.;kirkpatrick
1;24;3205;70;Downwards I bent. But in such dark as that,;kirkpatrick
1;24;3206;71;no eye alive could penetrate the depths.;kirkpatrick
1;24;3207;72;But, ‘Sir,’ I said, ‘make for the other edge,;kirkpatrick
1;24;3208;73;and let us then descend the pocket wall.;kirkpatrick
1;24;3209;74;From here I hear but do not understand.;kirkpatrick
1;24;3210;75;So, too, I see, yet focus not at all.’;kirkpatrick
1;24;3211;76;‘I oﬀer you,’ he said to me, ‘no answer;kirkpatrick
1;24;3212;77;save “just do it”. Noble demands, by right,;kirkpatrick
1;24;3213;78;deserve the consequence of silent deeds.’;kirkpatrick
1;24;3214;79;So where the bridgehead meets Embankment Eight;kirkpatrick
1;24;3215;80;we then went down, pursuing our descent,;kirkpatrick
1;24;3216;81;so all that pocket was displayed to me.;kirkpatrick
1;24;3217;82;And there I came to see a dreadful brood;kirkpatrick
1;24;3218;83;of writhing reptiles of such diverse kinds;kirkpatrick
1;24;3219;84;the memory drains the very blood from me.;kirkpatrick
1;24;3220;85;Let Libya boast – for all her sand – no more!;kirkpatrick
1;24;3221;86;Engender as she may chelydri, pharae,;kirkpatrick
1;24;3222;87;chenchres and amphisbaenae, jaculi,;kirkpatrick
1;24;3223;88;never – and, yes, add Ethiopia, too,;kirkpatrick
1;24;3224;89;with all, beyond the Red Sea, dry and waste –;kirkpatrick
1;24;3225;90;has she displayed so many vicious pests.;kirkpatrick
1;24;3226;91;And through all this abundance, bitter and grim,;kirkpatrick
1;24;3227;92;in panic naked humans ran – no holes;kirkpatrick
1;24;3228;93;to hide in here or heliotropic charms.;kirkpatrick
1;24;3229;94;Behind their backs, the sinners’ hands were bound;kirkpatrick
1;24;3230;95;by snakes. These sent both tail and neck between the;kirkpatrick
1;24;3231;96;butts, then formed up front the ends in knots.;kirkpatrick
1;24;3232;97;And near our point, at one of them (just look!);kirkpatrick
1;24;3233;98;a serpent headlong hurled itself and pierced;kirkpatrick
1;24;3234;99;exactly at the knit of spine and nape.;kirkpatrick
1;24;3235;100;Then, faster than you scribble ‘i’ or ‘o’,;kirkpatrick
1;24;3236;101;that shape caught ﬁre, ﬂash-ﬂared and then (needs must);kirkpatrick
1;24;3237;102;descended in cascading showers of ash.;kirkpatrick
1;24;3238;103;There, lying in destruction on the ground,;kirkpatrick
1;24;3239;104;the dead dust gathered of its own accord,;kirkpatrick
1;24;3240;105;becoming instantly the self it was.;kirkpatrick
1;24;3241;106;Compare: the phoenix (as the sages say);kirkpatrick
1;24;3242;107;will come to its ﬁve-hundredth year, then die,;kirkpatrick
1;24;3243;108;but then, on its own pyre, be born anew.;kirkpatrick
1;24;3244;109;Its lifelong food is neither grass nor grain,;kirkpatrick
1;24;3245;110;but nurture drawn from weeping balm and incense.;kirkpatrick
1;24;3246;111;Its shroud, at last, is fume of nard and myrrh.;kirkpatrick
1;24;3247;112;The sinner, ﬁrst, drops down as someone might;kirkpatrick
1;24;3248;113;when grappled down, not knowing how, by demons;kirkpatrick
1;24;3249;114;(or else some other epileptic turn),;kirkpatrick
1;24;3250;115;who then, on rising, gazes all around,;kirkpatrick
1;24;3251;116;bewildered by the overwhelming ill;kirkpatrick
1;24;3252;117;that came just now upon him, sighing, staring.;kirkpatrick
1;24;3253;118;So, too, this sinner, getting to his feet.;kirkpatrick
1;24;3254;119;What power and might in God! How harsh it is!;kirkpatrick
1;24;3255;120;How great the torrent of its vengeful blows!;kirkpatrick
1;24;3256;121;My leader then demanded who he was.;kirkpatrick
1;24;3257;122;‘I pelted down’ – the sinner, in reply –;kirkpatrick
1;24;3258;123;‘to this wild gorge, right now, from Tuscany.;kirkpatrick
1;24;3259;124;Beast living suited me, not human life,;kirkpatrick
1;24;3260;125;the mule that once I was. I’m Johnny Fucci,;kirkpatrick
1;24;3261;126;animal. Pistoia is my proper hole.’;kirkpatrick
1;24;3262;127;I to my leader: ‘Tell him, “Don’t rush oﬀ!”;kirkpatrick
1;24;3263;128;and make him say what guilt has thrust him down.;kirkpatrick
1;24;3264;129;I’ve seen him. He’s a man of blood and wrath.’;kirkpatrick
1;24;3265;130;The sinner, hearing this, made no pretence.;kirkpatrick
1;24;3266;131;He ﬁxed on me a concentrated eye,;kirkpatrick
1;24;3267;132;and coloured up in brash embarrassment.;kirkpatrick
1;24;3268;133;‘It pisses me right oﬀ,’ he then declared,;kirkpatrick
1;24;3269;134;‘far more than being ripped away from life,;kirkpatrick
1;24;3270;135;that you have got to see me in this misery.;kirkpatrick
1;24;3271;136;I can’t say “no” to what you ask of me.;kirkpatrick
1;24;3272;137;I’m stuck down here so deep ‘cos it was me,;kirkpatrick
1;24;3273;138;the thief who nicked the silver from the sanctuary.;kirkpatrick
1;24;3274;139;Then I just lied – to grass up someone else.;kirkpatrick
1;24;3275;140;You won’t, however, laugh at seeing this.;kirkpatrick
1;24;3276;141;If ever you return from these dark dives,;kirkpatrick
1;24;3277;142;prick up your ears and hear my prophecy:;kirkpatrick
1;24;3278;143;Pistoia ﬁrst will slim and lose its Blacks.;kirkpatrick
1;24;3279;144;Then Florence, too, renews its laws and ranks.;kirkpatrick
1;24;3280;145;Mars draws up ﬁreballs from the Val di Magra,;kirkpatrick
1;24;3281;146;wrapped all around in clouds and turbulence.;kirkpatrick
1;24;3282;147;And these, in acrid, ever-driven storms,;kirkpatrick
1;24;3283;148;will battle high above the Picene acre.;kirkpatrick
1;24;3284;149;A rapid bolt will rend the clouds apart,;kirkpatrick
1;24;3285;150;and every single White be seared by wounds.;kirkpatrick
1;24;3286;151;I tell you this. I want it all to hurt.’;kirkpatrick
1;25;3287;1;His words now reached their end. And then the robber;kirkpatrick
1;25;3288;2;hoisted hands on high – a ﬁg-fuck formed in each – and;kirkpatrick
1;25;3289;3;screamed: ‘Take that! I’m aiming, God, at you!’;kirkpatrick
1;25;3290;4;From that point on, the serpents were my friends.;kirkpatrick
1;25;3291;5;For one entwined its length around his neck;kirkpatrick
1;25;3292;6;as if to say: ‘I’d have him speak no more.’;kirkpatrick
1;25;3293;7;And then another bound his arms down tight,;kirkpatrick
1;25;3294;8;and clinched itself so ﬁrmly round the front;kirkpatrick
1;25;3295;9;he could not shake or shiver in either limb.;kirkpatrick
1;25;3296;10;Pistoia! Ah! Pistoia! Why not take a stand?;kirkpatrick
1;25;3297;11;Just burn yourself to blackened ash, and be;kirkpatrick
1;25;3298;12;no more. Your seed succeeds in doing only ill.;kirkpatrick
1;25;3299;13;In all of Hell, through every murky ring,;kirkpatrick
1;25;3300;14;I saw no spirit facing God so proud,;kirkpatrick
1;25;3301;15;even that king ﬂung down from Theban walls.;kirkpatrick
1;25;3302;16;Away he ﬂed. He spake no further word.;kirkpatrick
1;25;3303;17;And then there came, I saw, a wrathful centaur.;kirkpatrick
1;25;3304;18;‘Where? Where is he,’ he called, ‘so sour and crude?’;kirkpatrick
1;25;3305;19;Maremma, I should think – with all its swamps –;kirkpatrick
1;25;3306;20;has fewer snakes than he. They writhed from rump;kirkpatrick
1;25;3307;21;to where, on human features, lips begin.;kirkpatrick
1;25;3308;22;Above its shoulders, stretched behind the nape,;kirkpatrick
1;25;3309;23;there lay a dragon, wings extended wide.;kirkpatrick
1;25;3310;24;And all it hits against, it sets on ﬁre.;kirkpatrick
1;25;3311;25;‘This centaur,’ so my teacher said, ‘is Cacus.;kirkpatrick
1;25;3312;26;He is the one – so many times – who caused;kirkpatrick
1;25;3313;27;a lake of gore to ﬂood the Aventine.;kirkpatrick
1;25;3314;28;He does not tread the path his brethren take.;kirkpatrick
1;25;3315;29;For spying, once, a mighty herd at hand,;kirkpatrick
1;25;3316;30;he made it all his own by furtive fraud.;kirkpatrick
1;25;3317;31;Beneath the mace of Hercules (that god;kirkpatrick
1;25;3318;32;rained down a hundred blows, and he, perhaps,;kirkpatrick
1;25;3319;33;felt ten, no more) his devious doings ceased.’;kirkpatrick
1;25;3320;34;So Virgil spoke. The centaur sped away.;kirkpatrick
1;25;3321;35;But now three spirits had approached beneath,;kirkpatrick
1;25;3322;36;though neither of us noticed they were there;kirkpatrick
1;25;3323;37;until they shouted out: ‘So who are you?’;kirkpatrick
1;25;3324;38;Our story-telling pausing at this point,;kirkpatrick
1;25;3325;39;we ﬁxed attention wholly on that trio.;kirkpatrick
1;25;3326;40;Among the three was none I recognized.;kirkpatrick
1;25;3327;41;And yet it chanced – as happens many times –;kirkpatrick
1;25;3328;42;that one was forced to speak another’s name,;kirkpatrick
1;25;3329;43;inquiring: ‘Where has Cianfa got to now?’;kirkpatrick
1;25;3330;44;At which (to shut my leader up) I placed;kirkpatrick
1;25;3331;45;a ﬁnger slantwise from my chin to nose.;kirkpatrick
1;25;3332;46;If you are slow, my reader, to receive,;kirkpatrick
1;25;3333;47;in faith, what I’ll say now – no miracle.;kirkpatrick
1;25;3334;48;I saw it all, and yet can scarce believe.;kirkpatrick
1;25;3335;49;While, eyebrows raised, I stared at these three men,;kirkpatrick
1;25;3336;50;a reptile hurled itself with all six feet;kirkpatrick
1;25;3337;51;at one, front on, and took a total hold.;kirkpatrick
1;25;3338;52;It clenched the belly with its middle claws.;kirkpatrick
1;25;3339;53;With each anterior it seized an arm.;kirkpatrick
1;25;3340;54;It sank a forked fang deep in either cheek.;kirkpatrick
1;25;3341;55;Along each loin it slithered out a leg,;kirkpatrick
1;25;3342;56;then struck its tail between the two, to take,;kirkpatrick
1;25;3343;57;now upwardly, a grip around the buttocks.;kirkpatrick
1;25;3344;58;Ivy in tangles never barbed to tree;kirkpatrick
1;25;3345;59;so tight as this ferocious awfulness,;kirkpatrick
1;25;3346;60;linking its limbs in tendrils round that trunk.;kirkpatrick
1;25;3347;61;As though the two were formed of warming wax,;kirkpatrick
1;25;3348;62;each clung to each and, mingling in their hues,;kirkpatrick
1;25;3349;63;neither now, seemingly, was what it was.;kirkpatrick
1;25;3350;64;Like that, a ﬂame runs ﬂaring up a page;kirkpatrick
1;25;3351;65;and, just ahead, goes ever-darkening tints,;kirkpatrick
1;25;3352;66;not black as yet, and yet the white still dies.;kirkpatrick
1;25;3353;67;The other two, at this, stared on. And each;kirkpatrick
1;25;3354;68;moaned out: ‘Ohimé, Agnello, how you change!;kirkpatrick
1;25;3355;69;Already, look, you’re neither two nor one.’;kirkpatrick
1;25;3356;70;And yes, those two by now were both as one.;kirkpatrick
1;25;3357;71;That is: the outlines of the two appeared;kirkpatrick
1;25;3358;72;in one face only, two-ness lost and gone.;kirkpatrick
1;25;3359;73;Two arms were fashioned out of four long strips.;kirkpatrick
1;25;3360;74;Thorax and stomach, loins and thighs and hips;kirkpatrick
1;25;3361;75;became such organs as you’ve never seen.;kirkpatrick
1;25;3362;76;In each, the primal signs were all struck out.;kirkpatrick
1;25;3363;77;Two yet not either, as it seemed, this sick;kirkpatrick
1;25;3364;78;apparition. So, treading slow, it went its way.;kirkpatrick
1;25;3365;79;The great green lizard, at the summer’s height,;kirkpatrick
1;25;3366;80;lashed by a dog star rage from hedge to hedge,;kirkpatrick
1;25;3367;81;crosses the path as though a lightning ﬂash.;kirkpatrick
1;25;3368;82;So, paunch high (darting at the two, of three,;kirkpatrick
1;25;3369;83;who still remained), inﬂamed and ﬁerce, there came a;kirkpatrick
1;25;3370;84;snakelet, livid as a peppercorn.;kirkpatrick
1;25;3371;85;This serpent pierced in one that spot where ﬁrst;kirkpatrick
1;25;3372;86;we draw our nourishment, transﬁxing him.;kirkpatrick
1;25;3373;87;It then fell back, stretched out before his face.;kirkpatrick
1;25;3374;88;The one transﬁxed gazed down but spoke no word.;kirkpatrick
1;25;3375;89;Rather, he yawned, his feet just planted there.;kirkpatrick
1;25;3376;90;Sick sleep, it seemed, had struck him hard, or fever.;kirkpatrick
1;25;3377;91;He eyed the snake. The reptile eyed him back.;kirkpatrick
1;25;3378;92;Each gave out smoke in streams – the wound of one,;kirkpatrick
1;25;3379;93;the serpent’s jaws. The smoke streams slowly met.;kirkpatrick
1;25;3380;94;Lucan! Be silent now, and tell no more;kirkpatrick
1;25;3381;95;your snaky tales of poor Sabellus and Nasidius.;kirkpatrick
1;25;3382;96;Give ear to what the bow will now unleash.;kirkpatrick
1;25;3383;97;Ovid, be silent! Less ‘Cadmus’ and ‘Arethusa’!;kirkpatrick
1;25;3384;98;In turning verse, these two he may convert;kirkpatrick
1;25;3385;99;to snake or stream. I do not envy him.;kirkpatrick
1;25;3386;100;For he, through metamorphosis, did not;kirkpatrick
1;25;3387;101;compose two species, glance on glance, whose forms;kirkpatrick
1;25;3388;102;disposed themselves exchanging actual substance.;kirkpatrick
1;25;3389;103;Each answered each in working through this rule:;kirkpatrick
1;25;3390;104;"the serpent fashioned (from his tail) a fork;";kirkpatrick
1;25;3391;105;the wounded human dragged his footprints to.;kirkpatrick
1;25;3392;106;The legs, now fastening at their inner thighs,;kirkpatrick
1;25;3393;107;adhered so well that soon the join between;kirkpatrick
1;25;3394;108;gave no clear sign of ever having been.;kirkpatrick
1;25;3395;109;The cloven tail assumed the ﬁgure now;kirkpatrick
1;25;3396;110;of that which, over there, was lost to view.;kirkpatrick
1;25;3397;111;Hide softened here, but hardened over there.;kirkpatrick
1;25;3398;112;I saw each arm retract and reach its pit.;kirkpatrick
1;25;3399;113;The paws, conversely, of that stubby newt;kirkpatrick
1;25;3400;114;lengthened as much as human feet grew short.;kirkpatrick
1;25;3401;115;"The hindmost toes then curled around and clinched;";kirkpatrick
1;25;3402;116;these formed the member that a man conceals.;kirkpatrick
1;25;3403;117;The other wretch wrenched his own part in two.;kirkpatrick
1;25;3404;118;As now, around this pair, the fumes still hang,;kirkpatrick
1;25;3405;119;a gauze of stranger colours – causing hair;kirkpatrick
1;25;3406;120;to sprout fresh here, while there it plucks it sleek –;kirkpatrick
1;25;3407;121;the one rose up, the other fell down ﬂat,;kirkpatrick
1;25;3408;122;yet, peering out, as this snout changed for that,;kirkpatrick
1;25;3409;123;neither could wrest from either evil eye beams.;kirkpatrick
1;25;3410;124;Upright, the one dragged jowl across to temple.;kirkpatrick
1;25;3411;125;And then, from leakages of surplus pulp,;kirkpatrick
1;25;3412;126;a pair of ears appeared, on thinned-out jowls.;kirkpatrick
1;25;3413;127;Whatever residue did not run back;kirkpatrick
1;25;3414;128;now gelled, and gave that face its human nose.;kirkpatrick
1;25;3415;129;The lips, plumped up to meet the need, gained bulk.;kirkpatrick
1;25;3416;130;The other, lying ﬂat, extends his muzzle.;kirkpatrick
1;25;3417;131;Then, just like snails when pulling in their horns, he draws;kirkpatrick
1;25;3418;132;his ears back, ﬂush along his skull.;kirkpatrick
1;25;3419;133;And now the tongue – once whole, and quick to speak –;kirkpatrick
1;25;3420;134;divides in two. The other ﬁnds his fork;kirkpatrick
1;25;3421;135;has closed right up. The furls of smoke now cease.;kirkpatrick
1;25;3422;136;The soul, transmogriﬁed to fearful beast,;kirkpatrick
1;25;3423;137;ﬂees – hissing, snuﬄing – oﬀ across the pit.;kirkpatrick
1;25;3424;138;Spot on his track, the speaking presence spits.;kirkpatrick
1;25;3425;139;And then he turns on him his novel back;kirkpatrick
1;25;3426;140;to tell the third: ‘I’ll see slick Buoso go;kirkpatrick
1;25;3427;141;as I did, bellyﬂop, around this track.’;kirkpatrick
1;25;3428;142;Zymotic in the seventh bilge, I saw, then,;kirkpatrick
1;25;3429;143;change and counterchange. My only plea, if here;kirkpatrick
1;25;3430;144;my pen turns vain, must be sheer novelty.;kirkpatrick
1;25;3431;145;And though my vision was a bit confused;kirkpatrick
1;25;3432;146;(spirit quite drained of all its energies),;kirkpatrick
1;25;3433;147;these souls could not so covertly pass by;kirkpatrick
1;25;3434;148;that I should fail to see the cripple Puccio.;kirkpatrick
1;25;3435;149;Of three companions who had ﬁrst come there,;kirkpatrick
1;25;3436;150;he, all alone, escaped from alteration.;kirkpatrick
1;25;3437;151;The last was him that you, Gaville, weep for.;kirkpatrick
1;26;3438;1;Rejoice, Florentia! You’ve grown so grand;kirkpatrick
1;26;3439;2;that over land and sea you spread your beating wings,;kirkpatrick
1;26;3440;3;and through the whole of Hell your name resounds.;kirkpatrick
1;26;3441;4;Among those thieves and robbers there, I found,;kirkpatrick
1;26;3442;5;were ﬁve of your own citizens. I am ashamed.;kirkpatrick
1;26;3443;6;And you do not acquire, by this, great honour.;kirkpatrick
1;26;3444;7;Yet if we dream, near dawn, of what is true,;kirkpatrick
1;26;3445;8;then you, not long from now, will surely feel;kirkpatrick
1;26;3446;9;what Prato aches to see for you – others, as well.;kirkpatrick
1;26;3447;10;And were it now it would not be too soon.;kirkpatrick
1;26;3448;11;Would it were so, as rightly it should be.;kirkpatrick
1;26;3449;12;It weighs me down the more that time drags on.;kirkpatrick
1;26;3450;13;We now moved oﬀ. And climbing by those stairs;kirkpatrick
1;26;3451;14;that, going down, had bleached us ivory,;kirkpatrick
1;26;3452;15;my leader, mounting up, pulled me along.;kirkpatrick
1;26;3453;16;And so, proceeding on this lonely way;kirkpatrick
1;26;3454;17;through splintered rocks and outcrops from the ridge, feet;kirkpatrick
1;26;3455;18;without hands would not have gained advantage.;kirkpatrick
1;26;3456;19;It grieved me then, it grieves me now once more,;kirkpatrick
1;26;3457;20;to ﬁx my thoughts on what I witnessed there.;kirkpatrick
1;26;3458;21;Now, more than usual, I must hold mind back,;kirkpatrick
1;26;3459;22;lest brain should speed where virtue does not guide.;kirkpatrick
1;26;3460;23;Thus if, by some propitious star (or more),;kirkpatrick
1;26;3461;24;I’ve come to good, I’d best not make it void.;kirkpatrick
1;26;3462;25;A farmer, leaning on his hillside, rests.;kirkpatrick
1;26;3463;26;(It’s summer time, when he who lights the earth;kirkpatrick
1;26;3464;27;least hides his face from us.) This countryman,;kirkpatrick
1;26;3465;28;as now the ﬂy makes way for the mosquito,;kirkpatrick
1;26;3466;29;sees there, below him on the valley ﬂoor,;kirkpatrick
1;26;3467;30;(where he perhaps will plough and gather grapes);kirkpatrick
1;26;3468;31;glow-worms in numbers such as now I saw,;kirkpatrick
1;26;3469;32;glittering around the dip of Pocket Eight,;kirkpatrick
1;26;3470;33;when I arrived there, looking to its depths.;kirkpatrick
1;26;3471;34;Compare, as also in the Book of Kings:;kirkpatrick
1;26;3472;35;Elisha (once avenged by furious bears);kirkpatrick
1;26;3473;36;beheld Elijah’s chariot drawn away;kirkpatrick
1;26;3474;37;by horses rising to the Heavens, straight.;kirkpatrick
1;26;3475;38;His eye, unable to pursue, could see;kirkpatrick
1;26;3476;39;only the ﬂame, like cloud whisp, rising high.;kirkpatrick
1;26;3477;40;So, too, within the gullet of that ditch,;kirkpatrick
1;26;3478;41;these ﬁres move round. None shows its thievery.;kirkpatrick
1;26;3479;42;Yet each ﬁre stole some sinning soul away.;kirkpatrick
1;26;3480;43;I stood there on the bridge and craned to look.;kirkpatrick
1;26;3481;44;Indeed, had I not clutched a nearby rock,;kirkpatrick
1;26;3482;45;I surely would (unpushed) have fallen in.;kirkpatrick
1;26;3483;46;My leader, who had seen how hard I gazed,;kirkpatrick
1;26;3484;47;informed me now: ‘In all these ﬁres are souls.;kirkpatrick
1;26;3485;48;Each one is swaddled in its inward blaze.’;kirkpatrick
1;26;3486;49;‘Well, sir,’ I answered, ‘to be told by you,;kirkpatrick
1;26;3487;50;I am, of course, the surer. Myself, though,;kirkpatrick
1;26;3488;51;I’d already thought of that. I meant to ask:;kirkpatrick
1;26;3489;52;“Who comes within that cloven-crested ﬂame;kirkpatrick
1;26;3490;53;that seems to rise as from that pyre where, once, Eteocles;kirkpatrick
1;26;3491;54;was laid beside a brother slain?” ‘;kirkpatrick
1;26;3492;55;‘Within this ﬂame,’ so he now said, ‘suﬀering,;kirkpatrick
1;26;3493;56;are Ulysses and Diomed. As one, they face;kirkpatrick
1;26;3494;57;their nemesis, as they in rage were one.;kirkpatrick
1;26;3495;58;Within their ﬂame, the crime is now bewailed;kirkpatrick
1;26;3496;59;of those whose cunning wrought the Trojan horse – the;kirkpatrick
1;26;3497;60;door that freed the noble seed of Rome.;kirkpatrick
1;26;3498;61;They mourn as well the ruse by which – though dead –;kirkpatrick
1;26;3499;62;young Deidamia must weep Achilles’ loss.;kirkpatrick
1;26;3500;63;They’re punished, too, for theft, of sacred statues.’;kirkpatrick
1;26;3501;64;‘If they, within those tongues of ﬁre, can speak,;kirkpatrick
1;26;3502;65;I beg you, sir,’ I said, ‘and beg again –;kirkpatrick
1;26;3503;66;so may each prayer be worth a thousand more –;kirkpatrick
1;26;3504;67;that you do not forbid my waiting here;kirkpatrick
1;26;3505;68;until that ﬂame with horns has come this way.;kirkpatrick
1;26;3506;69;You see I bend to it with great desire.’;kirkpatrick
1;26;3507;70;‘Your prayer,’ he said, ‘is worthy of great praise,;kirkpatrick
1;26;3508;71;and I, most willingly, accede to it.;kirkpatrick
1;26;3509;72;But you must keep your tongue in tight control.;kirkpatrick
1;26;3510;73;Leave me to speak. For I know very well;kirkpatrick
1;26;3511;74;what you desire. Nor would these two be quick,;kirkpatrick
1;26;3512;75;perhaps, to hear your words. They both are Greek.’;kirkpatrick
1;26;3513;76;And when the ﬂame had reached, in time and place,;kirkpatrick
1;26;3514;77;a point at which my leader thought it ﬁt,;kirkpatrick
1;26;3515;78;I heard him form his utterances thus:;kirkpatrick
1;26;3516;79;‘O you there, two within a single ﬂame,;kirkpatrick
1;26;3517;80;if I, when living, won, in your eyes, merit,;kirkpatrick
1;26;3518;81;if merit, whether great or small, I won –;kirkpatrick
1;26;3519;82;in penning my exalted lines of verse –;kirkpatrick
1;26;3520;83;do not move on. Let one of you declare,;kirkpatrick
1;26;3521;84;where, lost, he went, to come upon his death.’;kirkpatrick
1;26;3522;85;The greater of those horns of ancient ﬂame;kirkpatrick
1;26;3523;86;began to tear and waver, murmuring;kirkpatrick
1;26;3524;87;as ﬁres will do when struggling in a wind.;kirkpatrick
1;26;3525;88;Drawing its pinnacle this way and that,;kirkpatrick
1;26;3526;89;as though this truly were a tongue that spoke,;kirkpatrick
1;26;3527;90;it ﬂung its utterance out, declaring: ‘Once;kirkpatrick
1;26;3528;91;I’d set my course from Circe (she had kept;kirkpatrick
1;26;3529;92;me near Gaeta for a year or more,;kirkpatrick
1;26;3530;93;before Aeneas, passing, named it that),;kirkpatrick
1;26;3531;94;no tenderness for son, no duty owed;kirkpatrick
1;26;3532;95;to ageing fatherhood, no love that should;kirkpatrick
1;26;3533;96;have brought my wife Penelope delight,;kirkpatrick
1;26;3534;97;could overcome in me my long desire,;kirkpatrick
1;26;3535;98;burning to understand how this world works,;kirkpatrick
1;26;3536;99;and know of human vices, worth and valour.;kirkpatrick
1;26;3537;100;Out, then, across the open depths, I put to sea,;kirkpatrick
1;26;3538;101;a single prow, and with me all my friends –;kirkpatrick
1;26;3539;102;the little crew that had not yet abandoned me.;kirkpatrick
1;26;3540;103;I saw both shorelines (one ran on to Spain,;kirkpatrick
1;26;3541;104;the other to Morocco), Sardinia;kirkpatrick
1;26;3542;105;and all those islands that our ocean bathes.;kirkpatrick
1;26;3543;106;I and my company were old and slow.;kirkpatrick
1;26;3544;107;And yet, arriving at that narrow sound;kirkpatrick
1;26;3545;108;where Hercules had once set up his mark –;kirkpatrick
1;26;3546;109;to warn that men should never pass beyond –;kirkpatrick
1;26;3547;110;I left Seville behind me on the right.;kirkpatrick
1;26;3548;111;To port already I had left Ceuta.;kirkpatrick
1;26;3549;112;“Brothers,” I said, “a hundred thousand;kirkpatrick
1;26;3550;113;perils you have passed and reached the Occident.;kirkpatrick
1;26;3551;114;For us, so little time remains to keep;kirkpatrick
1;26;3552;115;the vigil of our living sense. Do not;kirkpatrick
1;26;3553;116;deny your will to win experience,;kirkpatrick
1;26;3554;117;behind the sun, of worlds where no man dwells.;kirkpatrick
1;26;3555;118;Hold clear in thought your seed and origin.;kirkpatrick
1;26;3556;119;You were not made to live as mindless brutes,;kirkpatrick
1;26;3557;120;but go in search of virtue and true knowledge.”;kirkpatrick
1;26;3558;121;My men – attending to this little speech –;kirkpatrick
1;26;3559;122;I made so keen to take the onward way;kirkpatrick
1;26;3560;123;that even I could hardly have restrained them.;kirkpatrick
1;26;3561;124;Wheeling our stern against the morning sun,;kirkpatrick
1;26;3562;125;we made our oars our wings in crazy ﬂight,;kirkpatrick
1;26;3563;126;then on, and always leftward making gain.;kirkpatrick
1;26;3564;127;Now every star around the alien pole;kirkpatrick
1;26;3565;128;I saw by night. Our own star sank so low;kirkpatrick
1;26;3566;129;it never rose above the ocean ﬂoor.;kirkpatrick
1;26;3567;130;Five times the light that shines beneath the moon;kirkpatrick
1;26;3568;131;had ﬂared anew – and ﬁve times, too, grown dim – since;kirkpatrick
1;26;3569;132;we had set our course on that high venture.;kirkpatrick
1;26;3570;133;Ahead of us, a mountain now appeared,;kirkpatrick
1;26;3571;134;darkened through distance, soaring (to my eyes);kirkpatrick
1;26;3572;135;higher by far than any ever seen.;kirkpatrick
1;26;3573;136;We cheered for joy. This quickly turned to tears.;kirkpatrick
1;26;3574;137;For now a wind was born from that new land.;kirkpatrick
1;26;3575;138;Twisting, it struck at our forward timbers.;kirkpatrick
1;26;3576;139;The waves and keel three times it swirled around.;kirkpatrick
1;26;3577;140;And then a fourth. The afterdeck rose up,;kirkpatrick
1;26;3578;141;the prow went down, as pleased Another’s will,;kirkpatrick
1;26;3579;142;until once more the sea closed over us.’;kirkpatrick
1;27;3580;1;The ﬂame was upright now, and still. It meant;kirkpatrick
1;27;3581;2;to say no more. And so (the poet gently;kirkpatrick
1;27;3582;3;gave his leave) it went its way, away from us.;kirkpatrick
1;27;3583;4;But close behind, another blaze came up,;kirkpatrick
1;27;3584;5;and made us turn (a sound, confusedly,;kirkpatrick
1;27;3585;6;had issued out) and glance towards its top.;kirkpatrick
1;27;3586;7;Compare the Torture bull of Sicily.;kirkpatrick
1;27;3587;8;This bellowed its inaugural – and justly so –;kirkpatrick
1;27;3588;9;with wailings from the smith who’d ﬁled it smooth –;kirkpatrick
1;27;3589;10;these bellows echoing its victim’s moans –;kirkpatrick
1;27;3590;11;so that, although, in form mere hollow bronze,;kirkpatrick
1;27;3591;12;it was, it seemed, transﬁxed with living pains.;kirkpatrick
1;27;3592;13;So now those words which, dreadfully, could ﬁnd;kirkpatrick
1;27;3593;14;no vent or outlet from their burning source,;kirkpatrick
1;27;3594;15;were spoken in an accent of their own.;kirkpatrick
1;27;3595;16;But when these sounds had made their way along,;kirkpatrick
1;27;3596;17;and reached the tip which gave that ﬂick and twist that;kirkpatrick
1;27;3597;18;tongues will give to any stream of air,;kirkpatrick
1;27;3598;19;we heard: ‘You there! I square my words at you.;kirkpatrick
1;27;3599;20;I heard you say – in Lombard tones – just now:;kirkpatrick
1;27;3600;21;“Be out of it! I’ll rile on you no more.”;kirkpatrick
1;27;3601;22;I’m here, perhaps belatedly. But you,;kirkpatrick
1;27;3602;23;I hope, will not be loath to stay and speak.;kirkpatrick
1;27;3603;24;You see how far from loath I am. And I burn!;kirkpatrick
1;27;3604;25;If you have fallen even now to this;kirkpatrick
1;27;3605;26;blind world, leaving the land of lovely Italy;kirkpatrick
1;27;3606;27;(from which I carried any guilt I share),;kirkpatrick
1;27;3607;28;tell me: Romagna – is it peace or war?;kirkpatrick
1;27;3608;29;I was myself from those Urbino hills,;kirkpatrick
1;27;3609;30;the mountain yoke that ﬁrst unlocks the Tiber.’;kirkpatrick
1;27;3610;31;I held my head bowed low attentively,;kirkpatrick
1;27;3611;32;until my leader lightly touched my side,;kirkpatrick
1;27;3612;33;saying: ‘You speak. This one’s from Italy.’;kirkpatrick
1;27;3613;34;And I, who had indeed got words prepared,;kirkpatrick
1;27;3614;35;began without delay to speak to him:;kirkpatrick
1;27;3615;36;‘You, then, below! The soul that’s hidden there!;kirkpatrick
1;27;3616;37;Your dear Romagna (despots all the lot);kirkpatrick
1;27;3617;38;is not without, nor ever was, some war-at-heart.;kirkpatrick
1;27;3618;39;On leaving, though, I saw no open conﬂict.;kirkpatrick
1;27;3619;40;Ravenna stands as she has stood for years.;kirkpatrick
1;27;3620;41;The Eagle, blazon of the Clan Polenta,;kirkpatrick
1;27;3621;42;"broods in her skies; its vanes hide even Cervia.";kirkpatrick
1;27;3622;43;Forlì (her towers withstood that lengthy siege;kirkpatrick
1;27;3623;44;that left a blood-stained pile of French invaders) goes ever;kirkpatrick
1;27;3624;45;on beneath the green-clawed Lion.;kirkpatrick
1;27;3625;46;The Mastiﬀs, old and young, of Fort Verucchio,;kirkpatrick
1;27;3626;47;vicious in lordship over Lord Montagna,;kirkpatrick
1;27;3627;48;still, as is usual, gnash and suck their bone.;kirkpatrick
1;27;3628;49;And where Lamone and Santerno ﬂow,;kirkpatrick
1;27;3629;50;the towns are schooled by Lion’s-Whelp-sur-Argent.;kirkpatrick
1;27;3630;51;Summer to winter, north to south, he cants.;kirkpatrick
1;27;3631;52;And then that place whose rim the Savio bathes –;kirkpatrick
1;27;3632;53;"between the mountain and the plain it lies;";kirkpatrick
1;27;3633;54;it lives between high tyranny and freedom.;kirkpatrick
1;27;3634;55;So, who are you? I beg you now to say.;kirkpatrick
1;27;3635;56;If you still wish your name to brave the world, be no more;kirkpatrick
1;27;3636;57;stiﬀ than others are with you.’;kirkpatrick
1;27;3637;58;The ﬂame, as was its wont, ﬁrst roared a while.;kirkpatrick
1;27;3638;59;Then, to and fro it writhed its pointed peak;kirkpatrick
1;27;3639;60;and ﬁnally pronounced this speaking breath:;kirkpatrick
1;27;3640;61;‘Should I suppose, in answering, I spoke;kirkpatrick
1;27;3641;62;to any person who should ever see;kirkpatrick
1;27;3642;63;the world again, this ﬂame would shake no more.;kirkpatrick
1;27;3643;64;But since, if all I hear is true, there’s none;kirkpatrick
1;27;3644;65;who ever yet, alive, escaped these deeps,;kirkpatrick
1;27;3645;66;I may reply without the fear of infamy.;kirkpatrick
1;27;3646;67;I, once great warlord, was a friar next,;kirkpatrick
1;27;3647;68;believing, bound by cord, I’d make amends.;kirkpatrick
1;27;3648;69;And my beliefs would all have been assured,;kirkpatrick
1;27;3649;70;had not there been (he’ll rot!) that sovereign priest;kirkpatrick
1;27;3650;71;who won me, ﬁrmly, back to former sins.;kirkpatrick
1;27;3651;72;Qua re and “how” I mean that you should hear.;kirkpatrick
1;27;3652;73;While I was still, in form, such pulp and bone;kirkpatrick
1;27;3653;74;as, ﬁrst, my mother gave to me, actions;kirkpatrick
1;27;3654;75;of mine all favoured rather fox than lion.;kirkpatrick
1;27;3655;76;Stratagems, wiles and covert operations –;kirkpatrick
1;27;3656;77;I knew them all. These arts I so pursued;kirkpatrick
1;27;3657;78;that word of me rang out throughout the world.;kirkpatrick
1;27;3658;79;But when I recognized that now I’d come;kirkpatrick
1;27;3659;80;to where we all in life ought, properly,;kirkpatrick
1;27;3660;81;to furl our sail and take our rigging in,;kirkpatrick
1;27;3661;82;whatever once had pleased me now annoyed.;kirkpatrick
1;27;3662;83;I vowed – repentant, shriven – all obedience.;kirkpatrick
1;27;3663;84;It might (what misery!) have worked out well.;kirkpatrick
1;27;3664;85;The foremost lord of our new Pharisees,;kirkpatrick
1;27;3665;86;who waged in Rome a war around the Lateran;kirkpatrick
1;27;3666;87;"(never, of course, with Jew or Saracen;";kirkpatrick
1;27;3667;88;"his foes were faithful Christians everyone;";kirkpatrick
1;27;3668;89;none had been present at the fall of Acre,;kirkpatrick
1;27;3669;90;none worked as trader in the Sultan’s souks),;kirkpatrick
1;27;3670;91;did not, considering his own account,;kirkpatrick
1;27;3671;92;consult his oﬃce or his holy rule,;kirkpatrick
1;27;3672;93;nor mine – that cord which makes its wearer thin.;kirkpatrick
1;27;3673;94;As once, on Mount Soracte, Constantine;kirkpatrick
1;27;3674;95;required that Pope Silvester cure his leprosy,;kirkpatrick
1;27;3675;96;so he, mi-lording it, commanded me;kirkpatrick
1;27;3676;97;to cure him of his fevered arrogance.;kirkpatrick
1;27;3677;98;He asked advice, and I maintained my silence.;kirkpatrick
1;27;3678;99;He seemed plain drunk in what he had to say.;kirkpatrick
1;27;3679;100;But still he urged: “Don’t let your heart be doubtful.;kirkpatrick
1;27;3680;101;I grant you henceforth total absolution.;kirkpatrick
1;27;3681;102;Teach me how Penestrina may be razed.;kirkpatrick
1;27;3682;103;The power is mine (you know it well) to unlock;kirkpatrick
1;27;3683;104;Heaven’s door. Or lock it fast. Hence these two keys.;kirkpatrick
1;27;3684;105;My predecessor held them far from dear.”;kirkpatrick
1;27;3685;106;Such points – all weighty – drove me to the view;kirkpatrick
1;27;3686;107;that silence now was worse than quick assent.;kirkpatrick
1;27;3687;108;“Father,” I answered, “since you wash away;kirkpatrick
1;27;3688;109;the sin that I must now be guilty of,;kirkpatrick
1;27;3689;110;some promise – generous though of mean extent –;kirkpatrick
1;27;3690;111;assures you triumph from your lofty throne.”;kirkpatrick
1;27;3691;112;Now dead, Saint Francis came for me. But then;kirkpatrick
1;27;3692;113;a black alumnus of the Cherubim;kirkpatrick
1;27;3693;114;cried out: “Don’t cheat! You can’t dispose of him.;kirkpatrick
1;27;3694;115;Down must he come, to join my squalid thralls.;kirkpatrick
1;27;3695;116;His sound advice was, after all, deceitful.;kirkpatrick
1;27;3696;117;And since that hour, I’ve hovered round his hair.;kirkpatrick
1;27;3697;118;Repentance fails? There can’t be absolution,;kirkpatrick
1;27;3698;119;nor penitence when willing ill goes on.;kirkpatrick
1;27;3699;120;That is, by contradiction, impossibile.”;kirkpatrick
1;27;3700;121;The pain I felt! I shook myself awake.;kirkpatrick
1;27;3701;122;To me he said (he took a grip): “Perhaps;kirkpatrick
1;27;3702;123;you never knew: I practise logic, too.”;kirkpatrick
1;27;3703;124;To Minos he transported me, who then –;kirkpatrick
1;27;3704;125;eight times! – coiled tail around relentless spine.;kirkpatrick
1;27;3705;126;In utter ire, he bit this thing, and then;kirkpatrick
1;27;3706;127;declared: “Condemned is he to thievish ﬁre.”;kirkpatrick
1;27;3707;128;So that is why, as you see here, I’m lost,;kirkpatrick
1;27;3708;129;and thus go dressed in inward bitterness.’;kirkpatrick
1;27;3709;130;And once it reached the end of these few words,;kirkpatrick
1;27;3710;131;grieving, the ﬂame went oﬀ along its way,;kirkpatrick
1;27;3711;132;thrashing its horn and wrenching it awry.;kirkpatrick
1;27;3712;133;We now – my lord and I – went further on,;kirkpatrick
1;27;3713;134;rounding the ridge to ﬁnd another arch;kirkpatrick
1;27;3714;135;to span Ditch Nine – wherein, a fee is paid,;kirkpatrick
1;27;3715;136;incurred by those who force fair deals apart.;kirkpatrick
1;28;3716;1;Who could relate – even in words set loose;kirkpatrick
1;28;3717;2;from rhyme, even by telling it over and over –;kirkpatrick
1;28;3718;3;all that I witnessed now, the blood, the wounds.;kirkpatrick
1;28;3719;4;There is no doubt: all human speech would fail.;kirkpatrick
1;28;3720;5;Our powers, whether of mind or tongue, cannot;kirkpatrick
1;28;3721;6;embrace that measure of understanding.;kirkpatrick
1;28;3722;7;Suppose that, gathered in one single whole,;kirkpatrick
1;28;3723;8;were all those people of the fated South;kirkpatrick
1;28;3724;9;whose blood was shed in pain on the Apulian ﬁelds –;kirkpatrick
1;28;3725;10;be it as victims of the sons of Troy,;kirkpatrick
1;28;3726;11;or else, as Livy writes unerringly,;kirkpatrick
1;28;3727;12;in that long war where rings were heaped as spoils.;kirkpatrick
1;28;3728;13;Then add all those who suﬀered grievous wounds;kirkpatrick
1;28;3729;14;in wars against the Norman king, Guiscardo,;kirkpatrick
1;28;3730;15;and also add that band whose bones are gleaned;kirkpatrick
1;28;3731;16;at Ceperano still (where southerners, each one,;kirkpatrick
1;28;3732;17;proved traitorous). To Tagliacozzo, then, move on.;kirkpatrick
1;28;3733;18;There, ageing Elard won – by guile, not arms.;kirkpatrick
1;28;3734;19;Were every lopped-oﬀ limb or part pierced through;kirkpatrick
1;28;3735;20;seen once again, that, even so, would far;kirkpatrick
1;28;3736;21;from equal all the foul display in Pocket Nine.;kirkpatrick
1;28;3737;22;One I saw riven from his chin to fart hole.;kirkpatrick
1;28;3738;23;No barrel – midslat or moon rib missing –;kirkpatrick
1;28;3739;24;ever, I am certain, gaped as wide as that.;kirkpatrick
1;28;3740;25;Between his legs his guts all dangled down,;kirkpatrick
1;28;3741;26;innards and heart on show, and that grim bag;kirkpatrick
1;28;3742;27;that turns to shit whatever gullets swallow.;kirkpatrick
1;28;3743;28;My eyes were ﬁxed and gazed on him alone.;kirkpatrick
1;28;3744;29;And he gazed back. Then, opening up his thorax,;kirkpatrick
1;28;3745;30;hands at work: ‘Look now,’ he said, ‘how wide I spread!;kirkpatrick
1;28;3746;31;You see how mangled is the great Mohammed.;kirkpatrick
1;28;3747;32;Ali, ahead, wends weeping on his way,;kirkpatrick
1;28;3748;33;cloven in countenance from quiﬀ to chin.;kirkpatrick
1;28;3749;34;So, too, the others that you here observe,;kirkpatrick
1;28;3750;35;all in their lives sowed schism, scandal, discord.;kirkpatrick
1;28;3751;36;And that is why they all are here so splintered.;kirkpatrick
1;28;3752;37;Back there a devil deftly decks us out;kirkpatrick
1;28;3753;38;in these cruel ornaments, and crops each page;kirkpatrick
1;28;3754;39;in every quire that comes upon his sword edge.;kirkpatrick
1;28;3755;40;For, as we pass around this road of pain,;kirkpatrick
1;28;3756;41;each wound and gash is made entire and whole;kirkpatrick
1;28;3757;42;before we come to face him once again.;kirkpatrick
1;28;3758;43;But who are you, who there sniﬀ down at us;kirkpatrick
1;28;3759;44;and so perhaps are slow to meet the harm;kirkpatrick
1;28;3760;45;that you’ve been sentenced to for your own crime?’;kirkpatrick
1;28;3761;46;‘Death has not reached him yet,’ my teacher said,;kirkpatrick
1;28;3762;47;‘nor is he drawn by guilt to any pain.;kirkpatrick
1;28;3763;48;I, being dead, to give him full experience,;kirkpatrick
1;28;3764;49;am bound to lead him all through Hell, from gyre;kirkpatrick
1;28;3765;50;to gyre from ring to ring through every round.;kirkpatrick
1;28;3766;51;And this, I tell you, is the simple truth.’;kirkpatrick
1;28;3767;52;To hear this said, a hundred (or yet more);kirkpatrick
1;28;3768;53;stopped short. They looked in wonder from the ditch at;kirkpatrick
1;28;3769;54;me, in awe, forgetting their own agony.;kirkpatrick
1;28;3770;55;‘Since you, perhaps, will shortly hail the sun,;kirkpatrick
1;28;3771;56;then say: If Fra Dolcino is not keen;kirkpatrick
1;28;3772;57;to join me soon, he’d better stockpile well,;kirkpatrick
1;28;3773;58;lest winter snow in drifts makes barriers;kirkpatrick
1;28;3774;59;bestowing triumph on the Novarese,;kirkpatrick
1;28;3775;60;which they’d not lightly come by otherwise.’;kirkpatrick
1;28;3776;61;That was Mohammed who – as now to leave –;kirkpatrick
1;28;3777;62;had raised his foot while uttering these words.;kirkpatrick
1;28;3778;63;He placed it ﬂat to ground and went his way.;kirkpatrick
1;28;3779;64;Another then – his throat pierced through, his nose;kirkpatrick
1;28;3780;65;shorn oﬀ and level with his hanging brows,;kirkpatrick
1;28;3781;66;one ear alone, and only that to hear –;kirkpatrick
1;28;3782;67;now paused with all the rest to stare at me,;kirkpatrick
1;28;3783;68;but opened up, before the others might,;kirkpatrick
1;28;3784;69;his windpipe, crimson in its outward parts.;kirkpatrick
1;28;3785;70;‘You there,’ he said, ‘whom guilt does not condemn,;kirkpatrick
1;28;3786;71;I’ve met you once on our Italian soil,;kirkpatrick
1;28;3787;72;unless I’m much beguiled by close resemblance.;kirkpatrick
1;28;3788;73;If you should see once more the lovely plain;kirkpatrick
1;28;3789;74;that slopes between Vercelli and Marcabo,;kirkpatrick
1;28;3790;75;then call to mind again Da Medicina.;kirkpatrick
1;28;3791;76;And let the two best men of Fano know;kirkpatrick
1;28;3792;77;(Guido and Angiolello, his peer),;kirkpatrick
1;28;3793;78;supposing that our foresight is not vain,;kirkpatrick
1;28;3794;79;they’ll both be slung, their necks bedecked with stones,;kirkpatrick
1;28;3795;80;from boats that coast around Cattolica,;kirkpatrick
1;28;3796;81;betrayed in this by a villainous baron.;kirkpatrick
1;28;3797;82;From Cyprus on to the Majorcan isles,;kirkpatrick
1;28;3798;83;Neptune has never seen a crime so great;kirkpatrick
1;28;3799;84;pulled oﬀ by pirates or Argolian Greeks.;kirkpatrick
1;28;3800;85;That traitor with his single seeing eye;kirkpatrick
1;28;3801;86;(who rules a city that another with me here;kirkpatrick
1;28;3802;87;might wish his sight had still to hunger for);kirkpatrick
1;28;3803;88;will work it so that they will come to parley,;kirkpatrick
1;28;3804;89;then work it so they’ll need no prayer or vow;kirkpatrick
1;28;3805;90;to save them from the gales around Focara.’;kirkpatrick
1;28;3806;91;And I in answer: ‘Show me. Make it clear –;kirkpatrick
1;28;3807;92;if you so wish I’ll take back news of you –;kirkpatrick
1;28;3808;93;who is that despot with the bitter view?’;kirkpatrick
1;28;3809;94;At which, he put his hand around the jaw;kirkpatrick
1;28;3810;95;of one beside him, prising wide his mouth,;kirkpatrick
1;28;3811;96;and yelled out: ‘Here he is. And he can’t utter.;kirkpatrick
1;28;3812;97;Exiled, he drowned all Caesar’s hesitations.;kirkpatrick
1;28;3813;98;For, “Anyone,” he said, “who’s well prepared;kirkpatrick
1;28;3814;99;will always suﬀer harm from titubation.” ‘;kirkpatrick
1;28;3815;100;How dismal and confused he seemed to be,;kirkpatrick
1;28;3816;101;his tongue hacked out and hollow in his gullet,;kirkpatrick
1;28;3817;102;so headstrong once, this Curio, in parley.;kirkpatrick
1;28;3818;103;Then one came round with both his hands cut oﬀ.;kirkpatrick
1;28;3819;104;"He raised his ﬂesh stumps through the blackened air; he";kirkpatrick
1;28;3820;105;made his face drip ﬁlthy red with blood,;kirkpatrick
1;28;3821;106;and yelled: ‘Me too! I’m Mosca, you’ll recall,;kirkpatrick
1;28;3822;107;who said, alas: “What’s done, well, that is done.”;kirkpatrick
1;28;3823;108;And this sowed evil seed for every Tuscan.’;kirkpatrick
1;28;3824;109;To which I added: ‘Death to all your clan!’;kirkpatrick
1;28;3825;110;So, piling always grief on top of grief,;kirkpatrick
1;28;3826;111;he went his way, a melancholic madman.;kirkpatrick
1;28;3827;112;But I stayed there and, staring at the throng,;kirkpatrick
1;28;3828;113;I now saw something which, without more proof,;kirkpatrick
1;28;3829;114;I fear that I could never hope to speak of.;kirkpatrick
1;28;3830;115;Conscience, though, lends me conﬁdence to try.;kirkpatrick
1;28;3831;116;That good companion renders all men free;kirkpatrick
1;28;3832;117;under its breastplate, knowing we are pure.;kirkpatrick
1;28;3833;118;I saw – I’m sure – and still I seem to now,;kirkpatrick
1;28;3834;119;in company with others in that herd,;kirkpatrick
1;28;3835;120;a torso striding by without a head,;kirkpatrick
1;28;3836;121;who held that head, though severed, by the hair.;kirkpatrick
1;28;3837;122;It swung as might a lantern from his hand.;kirkpatrick
1;28;3838;123;‘Alas!’ it said, and stared at us in wonder.;kirkpatrick
1;28;3839;124;Himself he made a lamp for his own light.;kirkpatrick
1;28;3840;125;So here were two in one and one in two.;kirkpatrick
1;28;3841;126;How that can be He knows who orders so.;kirkpatrick
1;28;3842;127;He stood directly by the bridge foot now.;kirkpatrick
1;28;3843;128;He raised an arm (so, therefore, head and all);kirkpatrick
1;28;3844;129;to throw his words the closer to us there.;kirkpatrick
1;28;3845;130;And these words came: ‘See this, the harm, the hurt.;kirkpatrick
1;28;3846;131;Breathing you go still, watching on the dead.;kirkpatrick
1;28;3847;132;See now: is any punishment as great?;kirkpatrick
1;28;3848;133;And so you may return with news of me,;kirkpatrick
1;28;3849;134;then know that I’m that Bertran de Born;kirkpatrick
1;28;3850;135;who gave false comfort to the youthful king.;kirkpatrick
1;28;3851;136;Father and son, I set at mortal odds.;kirkpatrick
1;28;3852;137;No worse, with Absalom, Ahithophel,;kirkpatrick
1;28;3853;138;whose evil promptings prodded David on.;kirkpatrick
1;28;3854;139;Since persons so close-linked I put apart,;kirkpatrick
1;28;3855;140;so I, alas, apart now bear my brain,;kirkpatrick
1;28;3856;141;thus severed from its root in this great trunk.;kirkpatrick
1;28;3857;142;In me, then, counter-suﬀering can be seen.’;kirkpatrick
1;29;3858;1;This multitude, their wounds so various,;kirkpatrick
1;29;3859;2;had made my eyes (the lights I look by) drunk.;kirkpatrick
1;29;3860;3;So now they wished to stand there, and just gaze.;kirkpatrick
1;29;3861;4;But Virgil said: ‘Are you still staring on?;kirkpatrick
1;29;3862;5;Why is your seeing plunged so deep among;kirkpatrick
1;29;3863;6;such miserable, mutilated shades?;kirkpatrick
1;29;3864;7;You’ve not done this in any other pocket.;kirkpatrick
1;29;3865;8;Do you imagine you can count them all?;kirkpatrick
1;29;3866;9;Well, think! This trench goes twenty miles around.;kirkpatrick
1;29;3867;10;The moon already is below our feet.;kirkpatrick
1;29;3868;11;The time that we’re allowed to stay is short.;kirkpatrick
1;29;3869;12;And much is yet to see that still you’ve not.’;kirkpatrick
1;29;3870;13;‘If you had only cared,’ I answered him,;kirkpatrick
1;29;3871;14;‘to know the reasons for that lingering look,;kirkpatrick
1;29;3872;15;you would perhaps have let me stay still longer.’;kirkpatrick
1;29;3873;16;But he (my leader), and myself behind,;kirkpatrick
1;29;3874;17;was pressing on. I answered thus,;kirkpatrick
1;29;3875;18;and added, as I went: ‘Within that den;kirkpatrick
1;29;3876;19;where I just now, with reason, ﬁxed my eye,;kirkpatrick
1;29;3877;20;there is a spirit of my blood who weeps,;kirkpatrick
1;29;3878;21;grieving the guilt that, down there, sets its price.’;kirkpatrick
1;29;3879;22;My teacher then: ‘Allow no wave of thought;kirkpatrick
1;29;3880;23;henceforth to break around his memory.;kirkpatrick
1;29;3881;24;Attend to other things. And let him be.;kirkpatrick
1;29;3882;25;I saw him standing by the bridge foot there,;kirkpatrick
1;29;3883;26;still gesturing – a threatening ﬁnger raised –;kirkpatrick
1;29;3884;27;and heard his name called out: Geri del Bello.;kirkpatrick
1;29;3885;28;You were so caught, intent upon the sight;kirkpatrick
1;29;3886;29;of that one there, once sire of Altafort,;kirkpatrick
1;29;3887;30;you did not care to look around. So oﬀ he went.’;kirkpatrick
1;29;3888;31;‘His violent death,’ I now addressed my lord,;kirkpatrick
1;29;3889;32;‘which goes yet unavenged by any kin,;kirkpatrick
1;29;3890;33;whose fate must be to share this lasting shame,;kirkpatrick
1;29;3891;34;inspires disdain in him. I judge that this;kirkpatrick
1;29;3892;35;is why he left, speaking no word to me.;kirkpatrick
1;29;3893;36;This all the more makes clear to me my duty.’;kirkpatrick
1;29;3894;37;Our talk went on in such-like terms until;kirkpatrick
1;29;3895;38;we found the jutting spur that showed (or would, had;kirkpatrick
1;29;3896;39;there been light to see) the ﬂoor beyond.;kirkpatrick
1;29;3897;40;I stood there high above the ﬁnal cloister;kirkpatrick
1;29;3898;41;of Rottenpockets. All its postulants;kirkpatrick
1;29;3899;42;were present and revealed for us to see.;kirkpatrick
1;29;3900;43;A host of lamentations shot around me,;kirkpatrick
1;29;3901;44;their iron barbs sharp-tipped with pain and pity.;kirkpatrick
1;29;3902;45;I covered up my ears with both my hands.;kirkpatrick
1;29;3903;46;Such sicknesses as here there’d be if all;kirkpatrick
1;29;3904;47;contagions born of summer heat – from wards;kirkpatrick
1;29;3905;48;throughout Sardinia, the Chiana Vale, Maremma –;kirkpatrick
1;29;3906;49;were brought together in one single hole.;kirkpatrick
1;29;3907;50;That’s what it was, the stench that came from it, a fetor;kirkpatrick
1;29;3908;51;rising as from rotting limbs.;kirkpatrick
1;29;3909;52;Veering still leftwards as we always did,;kirkpatrick
1;29;3910;53;we searched that ridge and reached its ﬁnal crag.;kirkpatrick
1;29;3911;54;And there more vividly I came to view;kirkpatrick
1;29;3912;55;the depths in which, unerringly, the power;kirkpatrick
1;29;3913;56;of justice – minister of One on High –;kirkpatrick
1;29;3914;57;will castigate those known on earth as frauds.;kirkpatrick
1;29;3915;58;No greater woe, as I imagine it,;kirkpatrick
1;29;3916;59;was ever, even in Aegina, known – where plague;kirkpatrick
1;29;3917;60;infected every citizen and air;kirkpatrick
1;29;3918;61;so dripped malignancy, its creatures all –;kirkpatrick
1;29;3919;62;down to the smallest worm – fell, sickening fast.;kirkpatrick
1;29;3920;63;This ancient race was then restored (so say;kirkpatrick
1;29;3921;64;those poets who believe it true) by seed;kirkpatrick
1;29;3922;65;of ants. Such woe appeared across the dark pit ﬂoor.;kirkpatrick
1;29;3923;66;See, in their diﬀerent stooks, the spirits languishing.;kirkpatrick
1;29;3924;67;Some sprawled across the stomach of the next,;kirkpatrick
1;29;3925;68;some over shoulders. Others, on all fours,;kirkpatrick
1;29;3926;69;dragged on (to make a change) along the road.;kirkpatrick
1;29;3927;70;Without a word, we went on, step by step,;kirkpatrick
1;29;3928;71;still gazing at and listening to the sick.;kirkpatrick
1;29;3929;72;They could not lift their bodies from the ground.;kirkpatrick
1;29;3930;73;I saw there leaning, one against the next –;kirkpatrick
1;29;3931;74;propped up as pairs of saucepans are to lose;kirkpatrick
1;29;3932;75;their heat – two, scabby-spotted head to toe.;kirkpatrick
1;29;3933;76;And never have I seen a currycomb;kirkpatrick
1;29;3934;77;whisked (by a groom whose boss is waiting by,;kirkpatrick
1;29;3935;78;or else disgruntled to be woken up);kirkpatrick
1;29;3936;79;so brisk as these attacked that raging itch –;kirkpatrick
1;29;3937;80;for which no salve can ever now be found –;kirkpatrick
1;29;3938;81;with biting ﬁngernails to scrape at each.;kirkpatrick
1;29;3939;82;With ﬁngernails, each tore oﬀ showers of scabs,;kirkpatrick
1;29;3940;83;as might a ﬁsh knife when it’s skinning bream,;kirkpatrick
1;29;3941;84;or else, perhaps, some type with larger scales.;kirkpatrick
1;29;3942;85;‘You there, whose ﬁngers tear your chainmail oﬀ’ –;kirkpatrick
1;29;3943;86;to one of them my leader spoke these words –;kirkpatrick
1;29;3944;87;‘employing them as pincers sometimes, too,;kirkpatrick
1;29;3945;88;now tell us (may your manicure endure,;kirkpatrick
1;29;3946;89;your nails work well to all eternity!),;kirkpatrick
1;29;3947;90;are there Italians sunk with you down there?’;kirkpatrick
1;29;3948;91;‘We, wrecked and ruined, are Italians both.’;kirkpatrick
1;29;3949;92;So, weeping, one of them made this reply.;kirkpatrick
1;29;3950;93;‘But who are you that put to us this question?’;kirkpatrick
1;29;3951;94;‘I’m one,’ my leader answered, ‘who descends;kirkpatrick
1;29;3952;95;with this still-living man from ledge to ledge.;kirkpatrick
1;29;3953;96;My purpose is to show him all of Hell.’;kirkpatrick
1;29;3954;97;At this, the coupling that had held them sheared,;kirkpatrick
1;29;3955;98;and, trembling, each one turned himself to me,;kirkpatrick
1;29;3956;99;as others did who heard these words in echoes.;kirkpatrick
1;29;3957;100;My good, kind teacher came up close to me,;kirkpatrick
1;29;3958;101;saying: ‘Just tell him what it is you want.’;kirkpatrick
1;29;3959;102;And so, as he now wanted, I began:;kirkpatrick
1;29;3960;103;‘So may the thought of you be never robbed;kirkpatrick
1;29;3961;104;from human memories in the ﬁrst of lives,;kirkpatrick
1;29;3962;105;but live on brightly under many suns,;kirkpatrick
1;29;3963;106;tell me who you might be, and of what kin.;kirkpatrick
1;29;3964;107;Dread not – for all your foul and loathsome pain – but;kirkpatrick
1;29;3965;108;openly make known yourselves to me.’;kirkpatrick
1;29;3966;109;‘I was,’ one answered, ‘an Aretine once.;kirkpatrick
1;29;3967;110;Albero of Siena had me burned alive.;kirkpatrick
1;29;3968;111;But I’m not brought for what I died for here.;kirkpatrick
1;29;3969;112;O yes! It’s true, in jest I said to him:;kirkpatrick
1;29;3970;113;“I’ve got the knowhow. I can ﬂy through air.”;kirkpatrick
1;29;3971;114;Then he – all eyes, excited, but no genius –;kirkpatrick
1;29;3972;115;was eager that I put my art on show.;kirkpatrick
1;29;3973;116;I did not do a Daedalus. For that alone,;kirkpatrick
1;29;3974;117;he got the one who called him son to burn me.;kirkpatrick
1;29;3975;118;But Minos – not allowed to judge amiss –;kirkpatrick
1;29;3976;119;condemned me to this ﬁnal slot because,;kirkpatrick
1;29;3977;120;in life, I practised as an alchemist.’;kirkpatrick
1;29;3978;121;‘On land or sea,’ I turned towards the poet,;kirkpatrick
1;29;3979;122;‘was anyone as gormless as these Sienese?;kirkpatrick
1;29;3980;123;Even the French aren’t that idiotic.’;kirkpatrick
1;29;3981;124;At which, the other leper, overhearing,;kirkpatrick
1;29;3982;125;quipped in return: ‘Except, of course, for Stricca, who;kirkpatrick
1;29;3983;126;really knew what temperate spending is!;kirkpatrick
1;29;3984;127;And Nick as well, the twit. He, in that garden;kirkpatrick
1;29;3985;128;where the clove seed grows, discovered ﬁrst;kirkpatrick
1;29;3986;129;how rich the virtues of carnation are.;kirkpatrick
1;29;3987;130;Omit, as well, those merry men with whom;kirkpatrick
1;29;3988;131;Kid d’Ascian consumed both farms and vines.;kirkpatrick
1;29;3989;132;Dazzledeye, too – who taught the boy such wisdom.;kirkpatrick
1;29;3990;133;To see, however, who (like you) speaks here;kirkpatrick
1;29;3991;134;so anti-Sienese, just sharpen up your eye.;kirkpatrick
1;29;3992;135;My face – look hard – may give you your reply.;kirkpatrick
1;29;3993;136;I am, you’ll see, the shadow of Capocchio.;kirkpatrick
1;29;3994;137;Alchemically, I falsiﬁed base metals;kirkpatrick
1;29;3995;138;and, if I eye you well, then you’ll recall;kirkpatrick
1;29;3996;139;how marvellous an ape of nature I was.’;kirkpatrick
1;30;3997;1;Think of that age when Juno – wracked with wrath,;kirkpatrick
1;30;3998;2;so envious of Semele – expressed her spite,;kirkpatrick
1;30;3999;3;over and over, against the blood of Thebes.;kirkpatrick
1;30;4000;4;That was the time when Athamas ran mad.;kirkpatrick
1;30;4001;5;He saw his wife who carried, as she went,;kirkpatrick
1;30;4002;6;in either arm the load of their two sons,;kirkpatrick
1;30;4003;7;and yelled: ‘Come on! Let’s spread those nets! I mean;kirkpatrick
1;30;4004;8;to stalk them all, both whelps and lioness.’;kirkpatrick
1;30;4005;9;He then stretched out his unrelenting claws.;kirkpatrick
1;30;4006;10;He grasped one child (Learchus was his name).;kirkpatrick
1;30;4007;11;He whirled him round. He dashed him on a stone.;kirkpatrick
1;30;4008;12;His wife drowned, loaded with their second son.;kirkpatrick
1;30;4009;13;When, likewise, ever-turning Fate brought down,;kirkpatrick
1;30;4010;14;in ﬂames, the Trojans from all-daring height –;kirkpatrick
1;30;4011;15;and so, together, king and kingdom broke –;kirkpatrick
1;30;4012;16;Hecuba, grieving, wretched, now enslaved,;kirkpatrick
1;30;4013;17;ﬁrst saw Polyxena, her daughter, dead,;kirkpatrick
1;30;4014;18;and then – to ﬁnd there, lain along the margin;kirkpatrick
1;30;4015;19;of the sea, her youngest, Polydorus –;kirkpatrick
1;30;4016;20;barked in her lunacy like any cur,;kirkpatrick
1;30;4017;21;the pain of it so wrenched her mind askew.;kirkpatrick
1;30;4018;22;And yet no fury known in Troy or Thebes;kirkpatrick
1;30;4019;23;was ever seen, in anyone, to strike;kirkpatrick
1;30;4020;24;so viciously at beast or human limb;kirkpatrick
1;30;4021;25;as now I saw in two blank, naked shades –;kirkpatrick
1;30;4022;26;who, racing round that circle, gnashed and gored;kirkpatrick
1;30;4023;27;as swine do when their pigsty is unbarred.;kirkpatrick
1;30;4024;28;One got Capocchio. At the very knot;kirkpatrick
1;30;4025;29;of neck and spine, his tusks sank in. Then round;kirkpatrick
1;30;4026;30;the hard pit ﬂoor he hauled him, belly scraping.;kirkpatrick
1;30;4027;31;The Aretine (still there) spoke all atremble:;kirkpatrick
1;30;4028;32;‘That banshee idiot is Gianni Schicchi.;kirkpatrick
1;30;4029;33;He rages on, and treats us all like that.’;kirkpatrick
1;30;4030;34;‘Really?’ I answered. ‘Well, let’s hope his fangs;kirkpatrick
1;30;4031;35;don’t pierce your rear. But (not to trouble you),;kirkpatrick
1;30;4032;36;please say who’s that, before it springs away.’;kirkpatrick
1;30;4033;37;‘That soul is known in legend,’ he declared.;kirkpatrick
1;30;4034;38;‘It’s Myrrha the Depraved, beyond the bounds;kirkpatrick
1;30;4035;39;of love (as love should be) her father’s friend.;kirkpatrick
1;30;4036;40;She made her way to meet him in that sin,;kirkpatrick
1;30;4037;41;shaping herself in counterfeit disguise.;kirkpatrick
1;30;4038;42;So, too, the other, shooting oﬀ. To win;kirkpatrick
1;30;4039;43;a mare (the queen of all the herd) he shaped;kirkpatrick
1;30;4040;44;in counterfeit the guise of dying Buoso,;kirkpatrick
1;30;4041;45;whose testament, attested thus, was sound.’;kirkpatrick
1;30;4042;46;And now, when these two raging shades, on whom;kirkpatrick
1;30;4043;47;till now I’d ﬁxed my eye, had gone their way,;kirkpatrick
1;30;4044;48;I turned and looked at other ill-created souls.;kirkpatrick
1;30;4045;49;And one I saw was fashioned like a lute,;kirkpatrick
1;30;4046;50;or would have been if severed at the groin,;kirkpatrick
1;30;4047;51;to amputate those parts where humans fork.;kirkpatrick
1;30;4048;52;Dropsy (osmosis of a morbid ﬂux):;kirkpatrick
1;30;4049;53;that discomposes, as the swellings rise,;kirkpatrick
1;30;4050;54;all natural ﬁt – so face and paunch mismatch –;kirkpatrick
1;30;4051;55;constrained him, so his mouth hung open wide.;kirkpatrick
1;30;4052;56;So, too, in fever victims, wracked with thirst,;kirkpatrick
1;30;4053;57;one lip curls back, the lower meets the chin.;kirkpatrick
1;30;4054;58;‘O you who pass and know no pain (though why;kirkpatrick
1;30;4055;59;I cannot understand) through this mean world,’;kirkpatrick
1;30;4056;60;so he began, ‘behold and hold in mind;kirkpatrick
1;30;4057;61;the miseries of mastercraftsman Adam.;kirkpatrick
1;30;4058;62;"I had, alive, my share of all I sought;";kirkpatrick
1;30;4059;63;and now I crave, alas, the merest water drop.;kirkpatrick
1;30;4060;64;Those brooks that trickle down the high green hills;kirkpatrick
1;30;4061;65;to reach the Arno from the Casentine;kirkpatrick
1;30;4062;66;and, as they run, make channels, chill and moist,;kirkpatrick
1;30;4063;67;stand always in my sight. And not in vain:;kirkpatrick
1;30;4064;68;the image of them parches me far more;kirkpatrick
1;30;4065;69;than this disease that strips my face of meat.;kirkpatrick
1;30;4066;70;Unbending justice probes me to the core.;kirkpatrick
1;30;4067;71;It takes its hint from regions where I sinned,;kirkpatrick
1;30;4068;72;meaning the more to put my sighs to ﬂight.;kirkpatrick
1;30;4069;73;Here Fort Romena stands, and here I forged;kirkpatrick
1;30;4070;74;fake specie, printed with the Baptist marque.;kirkpatrick
1;30;4071;75;On that account, I left, up there, my body burned.;kirkpatrick
1;30;4072;76;Yet could I only glimpse those woeful souls –;kirkpatrick
1;30;4073;77;Guido or Sandro or their brother – here,;kirkpatrick
1;30;4074;78;I’d not exchange the Branda Spring for that.;kirkpatrick
1;30;4075;79;Already in, there’s one of them, if those;kirkpatrick
1;30;4076;80;crazed shadows as they whirl around speak truth.;kirkpatrick
1;30;4077;81;What use is that to me? My limbs are bound.;kirkpatrick
1;30;4078;82;If only I were still so light and lithe;kirkpatrick
1;30;4079;83;to travel in a hundred years one inch,;kirkpatrick
1;30;4080;84;already I’d have started on that path,;kirkpatrick
1;30;4081;85;seeking him out from all this ﬁlthy clan.;kirkpatrick
1;30;4082;86;And this ditch turns eleven miles around.;kirkpatrick
1;30;4083;87;Nor is it less than half a mile across!;kirkpatrick
1;30;4084;88;I’m only in this mess because of them.;kirkpatrick
1;30;4085;89;They led me on. I counterfeited ﬂorins;kirkpatrick
1;30;4086;90;so each contained three carats-worth of dross.’;kirkpatrick
1;30;4087;91;‘And who,’ I said, ‘are those two so-and-sos,;kirkpatrick
1;30;4088;92;steaming as wet hands do on winter days,;kirkpatrick
1;30;4089;93;those lying tight against your left frontier?’;kirkpatrick
1;30;4090;94;‘I found them here,’ he said, ‘(they’ve not turned since);kirkpatrick
1;30;4091;95;as soon as I showered down upon this midden.;kirkpatrick
1;30;4092;96;I do not think they’ll budge in all eternity.;kirkpatrick
1;30;4093;97;Joseph was falsely charged by that “she” there.;kirkpatrick
1;30;4094;98;The other, just as false, is Sinon (Trojan-Greek!).;kirkpatrick
1;30;4095;99;Their biting fever brews that curdled reek.’;kirkpatrick
1;30;4096;100;Then one of them, who took it much amiss –;kirkpatrick
1;30;4097;101;or so I’d guess, to hear his name so sullied –;kirkpatrick
1;30;4098;102;now thumped that tight-stretched belly with his ﬁst.;kirkpatrick
1;30;4099;103;It rumbled forth as though it were a drum.;kirkpatrick
1;30;4100;104;Adam (the master) countered with his arm;kirkpatrick
1;30;4101;105;to strike him no less hard across the face,;kirkpatrick
1;30;4102;106;and said: ‘It may well be I cannot move,;kirkpatrick
1;30;4103;107;seeing how heavy I’ve become in limb.;kirkpatrick
1;30;4104;108;But still my arms are free to do the job.’;kirkpatrick
1;30;4105;109;The answer came: ‘You weren’t as free as that;kirkpatrick
1;30;4106;110;when, arms trussed up, you went to mount the pyre.;kirkpatrick
1;30;4107;111;Your arms were free, though, in their forging days.’;kirkpatrick
1;30;4108;112;‘There,’ the hydroptic said, ‘you speak mere truth.;kirkpatrick
1;30;4109;113;Yet, as a witness, you were not so true;kirkpatrick
1;30;4110;114;at Troy, when true words were required of you.’;kirkpatrick
1;30;4111;115;‘Well, I spoke false, and you struck dodgy coin.;kirkpatrick
1;30;4112;116;But I’m here,’ Sinon said, ‘for one plain fault.;kirkpatrick
1;30;4113;117;You were accused of more than any demon.’;kirkpatrick
1;30;4114;118;‘The horse! Remember that, you lying cheat!’;kirkpatrick
1;30;4115;119;(This came in answer out of Swollenguts.);kirkpatrick
1;30;4116;120;‘Tough luck on you that all the world knows that.’;kirkpatrick
1;30;4117;121;‘And tough on you,’ the Greek replied, ‘the thirst;kirkpatrick
1;30;4118;122;that cracks your bloated tongue, the bilge that swells that;kirkpatrick
1;30;4119;123;belly to a hedgerow round your eyes.’;kirkpatrick
1;30;4120;124;At which: ‘Yeah, yeah’ (the coiner). ‘Sickness;kirkpatrick
1;30;4121;125;has stretched your mouth (what’s new?) to tearing point.;kirkpatrick
1;30;4122;126;I may be dry. I’m swollen, ripe with pus.;kirkpatrick
1;30;4123;127;But you’re burnt-out. Your sick head throbs and aches.;kirkpatrick
1;30;4124;128;It wouldn’t take too much – a word or so –;kirkpatrick
1;30;4125;129;to make you lick the mirror of Narcissus.’;kirkpatrick
1;30;4126;130;All ears, I strained to listen in – until;kirkpatrick
1;30;4127;131;I heard my teacher speak: ‘Go on! Just gaze!;kirkpatrick
1;30;4128;132;It won’t take much for me to ﬁght with you.’;kirkpatrick
1;30;4129;133;And when I heard his words, so near to wrath,;kirkpatrick
1;30;4130;134;I turned towards him with a shame that still,;kirkpatrick
1;30;4131;135;on calling it to mind, brews vertigo.;kirkpatrick
1;30;4132;136;Like someone dreaming of a harm to come,;kirkpatrick
1;30;4133;137;who, dreaming, yearns for this to be some dream,;kirkpatrick
1;30;4134;138;and hence desires what is as though it weren’t,;kirkpatrick
1;30;4135;139;so was I now. For wishing I could speak,;kirkpatrick
1;30;4136;140;and so excuse myself, I so excused myself,;kirkpatrick
1;30;4137;141;and did not think that all along I did.;kirkpatrick
1;30;4138;142;‘Less shame,’ my master said to me, ‘makes clean;kirkpatrick
1;30;4139;143;far greater fault than yours has been. And so;kirkpatrick
1;30;4140;144;cast oﬀ the weight of all your misery.;kirkpatrick
1;30;4141;145;Consider well. I’m always by your side.;kirkpatrick
1;30;4142;146;Remember this, if Fortune leads you on;kirkpatrick
1;30;4143;147;to where such spats as this are played out loud.;kirkpatrick
1;30;4144;148;To wish to hear such stuﬀ is pretty low.’;kirkpatrick
1;31;4145;1;The self-same tongue that bit me ﬁrst so hard;kirkpatrick
1;31;4146;2;that both my cheeks had coloured up, bright red,;kirkpatrick
1;31;4147;3;now oﬀered once again its remedy.;kirkpatrick
1;31;4148;4;So, too (as I have heard the story told),;kirkpatrick
1;31;4149;5;the spear that both Achilles and his father bore;kirkpatrick
1;31;4150;6;would cause a wound that spear alone could cure.;kirkpatrick
1;31;4151;7;We turned our back upon the dismal deep,;kirkpatrick
1;31;4152;8;riding the bank that circles it around,;kirkpatrick
1;31;4153;9;and made our way across without more speech.;kirkpatrick
1;31;4154;10;Here it was less than night and less than day,;kirkpatrick
1;31;4155;11;so that our seeing went no way ahead.;kirkpatrick
1;31;4156;12;But then I heard a horn ring out so loud;kirkpatrick
1;31;4157;13;that thunder in comparison is vapid,;kirkpatrick
1;31;4158;14;and, turning back to see the echoing source,;kirkpatrick
1;31;4159;15;I ﬁxed my eyes upon one single place.;kirkpatrick
1;31;4160;16;After the great and grievous rout at which;kirkpatrick
1;31;4161;17;was lost the sacred band of Charlemagne,;kirkpatrick
1;31;4162;18;great Roland sounded notes of no such terror.;kirkpatrick
1;31;4163;19;I had not held my head turned there for long;kirkpatrick
1;31;4164;20;when (so it seemed) I now saw many towers.;kirkpatrick
1;31;4165;21;And therefore, ‘Sir,’ I said, ‘what town is this?’;kirkpatrick
1;31;4166;22;‘Because,’ he said, ‘through all these wreaths of shade;kirkpatrick
1;31;4167;23;you rush ahead too far from what’s at hand,;kirkpatrick
1;31;4168;24;you form of it a blurred and empty image.;kirkpatrick
1;31;4169;25;You’ll see quite clearly when you soon arrive;kirkpatrick
1;31;4170;26;how greatly distance may deceive the sense.;kirkpatrick
1;31;4171;27;So drive yourself a little further on.’;kirkpatrick
1;31;4172;28;Then, with great tenderness, he took my hand.;kirkpatrick
1;31;4173;29;He then went on: ‘And yet before we step;kirkpatrick
1;31;4174;30;ahead – so all these facts may seem less odd –;kirkpatrick
1;31;4175;31;you ought to know that these aren’t towers. They’re;kirkpatrick
1;31;4176;32;giants.;kirkpatrick
1;31;4177;33;These stand within the well around its rim,;kirkpatrick
1;31;4178;34;navel height downwards, all the lot of them.’;kirkpatrick
1;31;4179;35;As when a mist is thinning out, the gaze;kirkpatrick
1;31;4180;36;will, point by point, begin to recompose;kirkpatrick
1;31;4181;37;the ﬁgure hidden by the steam-thick air,;kirkpatrick
1;31;4182;38;so, boring through that dense, dark atmosphere,;kirkpatrick
1;31;4183;39;approaching ever closer to the edge,;kirkpatrick
1;31;4184;40;false knowledge ﬂed and fear grew yet more great.;kirkpatrick
1;31;4185;41;For, as above its circling curtain wall,;kirkpatrick
1;31;4186;42;Montereggione boasts a crown of towers,;kirkpatrick
1;31;4187;43;so too above the bank that rings the well;kirkpatrick
1;31;4188;44;stood, towering here to half their body height,;kirkpatrick
1;31;4189;45;the dreadful giants, who are under threat;kirkpatrick
1;31;4190;46;from highest Jove whenever he wields thunder.;kirkpatrick
1;31;4191;47;By now I saw, in each of these, the face,;kirkpatrick
1;31;4192;48;the chest and shoulders, areas of paunch,;kirkpatrick
1;31;4193;49;and, down the ribcage, all their dangling arms.;kirkpatrick
1;31;4194;50;Nature did well, desisting from the art;kirkpatrick
1;31;4195;51;of forming animals like that. She thus;kirkpatrick
1;31;4196;52;deprived great Mars of his executors.;kirkpatrick
1;31;4197;53;If she, on that account, did not repent;kirkpatrick
1;31;4198;54;of whales and elephants, to subtle minds;kirkpatrick
1;31;4199;55;this will seem right, and most intelligent.;kirkpatrick
1;31;4200;56;For when the powers of working intellect;kirkpatrick
1;31;4201;57;are wed to strength and absolute illwill,;kirkpatrick
1;31;4202;58;then humans cannot ﬁnd a place to hide.;kirkpatrick
1;31;4203;59;In bulk and length, his face could be compared;kirkpatrick
1;31;4204;60;to that bronze pine cone in Saint Peter’s, Rome.;kirkpatrick
1;31;4205;61;His other bones were all in due proportion.;kirkpatrick
1;31;4206;62;And so that bank (his ﬁg leaf, ‘zone’ or apron,;kirkpatrick
1;31;4207;63;hanging around his loins below) displayed,;kirkpatrick
1;31;4208;64;above, up to his mane, as much of him;kirkpatrick
1;31;4209;65;as three tall Frisians would boast in vain.;kirkpatrick
1;31;4210;66;I saw their thirty-eight-inch ﬁnger spans;kirkpatrick
1;31;4211;67;down from the point where cloaks are buckled on.;kirkpatrick
1;31;4212;68;‘Raphèl maìamècche zabì almì,’;kirkpatrick
1;31;4213;69;so screaming it began, that fearsome mouth,;kirkpatrick
1;31;4214;70;unﬁt to utter any sweeter psalm.;kirkpatrick
1;31;4215;71;My leader aimed: ‘You idiotic soul!;kirkpatrick
1;31;4216;72;Stick to your horn. With that, give vent to wrath,;kirkpatrick
1;31;4217;73;or any passion that you chance to feel.;kirkpatrick
1;31;4218;74;Just fumble round your neck, you great dumb thing.;kirkpatrick
1;31;4219;75;You’ll ﬁnd the cord it’s tied to. There it rests.;kirkpatrick
1;31;4220;76;A chevron – see? – across your mighty breast.’;kirkpatrick
1;31;4221;77;And then to me: ‘He stands his own accuser.;kirkpatrick
1;31;4222;78;It’s Nimrod there. Through his sick whim;kirkpatrick
1;31;4223;79;no single tongue is spoken anywhere.;kirkpatrick
1;31;4224;80;So, let him be. We’ll not speak in that vein.;kirkpatrick
1;31;4225;81;For every tongue, to him, remains the same;kirkpatrick
1;31;4226;82;as his tongue is to others: quite unknown.’;kirkpatrick
1;31;4227;83;"Now, turning left, we made a longer march;";kirkpatrick
1;31;4228;84;and there (the distance of a crossbow shot);kirkpatrick
1;31;4229;85;we found a bigger ogre, ﬁercer still.;kirkpatrick
1;31;4230;86;Who that lord was I cannot tell, who locked;kirkpatrick
1;31;4231;87;these shackles round him and about. He held;kirkpatrick
1;31;4232;88;his right arm bound in front, his left behind,;kirkpatrick
1;31;4233;89;by one tight chain that – tangling down – was hitched;kirkpatrick
1;31;4234;90;a full ﬁve turns around the bits we saw,;kirkpatrick
1;31;4235;91;netherwards stretching from his neck to waist.;kirkpatrick
1;31;4236;92;‘This one, in pride, was quick to prove his power;kirkpatrick
1;31;4237;93;against the majesty of Jupiter.’;kirkpatrick
1;31;4238;94;Thus spoke my leader. ‘His reward is this.;kirkpatrick
1;31;4239;95;By name Ephialtes, his deeds were done;kirkpatrick
1;31;4240;96;when giants caused the deities such dread.;kirkpatrick
1;31;4241;97;He can’t now budge the arm he wielded then.’;kirkpatrick
1;31;4242;98;And I to him: ‘If it were possible;kirkpatrick
1;31;4243;99;to gain with my own eyes experience;kirkpatrick
1;31;4244;100;of measureless Briareus, that I’d like.’;kirkpatrick
1;31;4245;101;‘Antaeus,’ he in answer said, ‘you’ll see;kirkpatrick
1;31;4246;102;not very far from here. And he – unchained;kirkpatrick
1;31;4247;103;and speaking, too – will lower us to sin’s last ﬂoor.;kirkpatrick
1;31;4248;104;The one whom you so keenly wish to see;kirkpatrick
1;31;4249;105;is over there, a good way further on,;kirkpatrick
1;31;4250;106;constrained like these but ﬁercer still in mien.’;kirkpatrick
1;31;4251;107;No earthquake, rude in vigour, ever struck;kirkpatrick
1;31;4252;108;a tower with such great force as Ephialtes,;kirkpatrick
1;31;4253;109;writhing round suddenly, now shook himself.;kirkpatrick
1;31;4254;110;And, more than ever now in mortal fear,;kirkpatrick
1;31;4255;111;sheer terror would have done the trick, had I;kirkpatrick
1;31;4256;112;not seen the fetters that restrained him there.;kirkpatrick
1;31;4257;113;And now, as we proceeded on our way,;kirkpatrick
1;31;4258;114;we came upon Antaeus, rising high;kirkpatrick
1;31;4259;115;(omitting head) ﬁve yards above the pit.;kirkpatrick
1;31;4260;116;‘You there! Yes, you! In that propitious vale;kirkpatrick
1;31;4261;117;where Hannibal turned tail with all his men –;kirkpatrick
1;31;4262;118;and so made Scipio the heir of fame –;kirkpatrick
1;31;4263;119;you brought as spoils a thousand lions back.;kirkpatrick
1;31;4264;120;And if, like all your brothers, you had joined;kirkpatrick
1;31;4265;121;in battle with the gods above, then (some;kirkpatrick
1;31;4266;122;believe) those earthborn sons might well have won.;kirkpatrick
1;31;4267;123;Then set us down – and please, no dark disdain –;kirkpatrick
1;31;4268;124;deep in Cocytus, locked by freezing keys.;kirkpatrick
1;31;4269;125;Don’t make us trudge to Tityos or Typhon.;kirkpatrick
1;31;4270;126;This man can give you what you yearn to have.;kirkpatrick
1;31;4271;127;Therefore bend down. And do not twist your snout.;kirkpatrick
1;31;4272;128;To earth he can still carry back your name.;kirkpatrick
1;31;4273;129;He’s living still – and so expects to, long,;kirkpatrick
1;31;4274;130;unless grace summons him before his time.’;kirkpatrick
1;31;4275;131;My teacher spoke. The giant in great haste;kirkpatrick
1;31;4276;132;stretched out his hands – whose powerful clutch had once;kirkpatrick
1;31;4277;133;been felt by Hercules – to take him in his ﬁst.;kirkpatrick
1;31;4278;134;And Virgil, when he felt himself well held,;kirkpatrick
1;31;4279;135;now said to me: ‘Come here so I can take you!’;kirkpatrick
1;31;4280;136;He packed us in – one bundle, him and me.;kirkpatrick
1;31;4281;137;Just as the Garisenda tower, when viewed;kirkpatrick
1;31;4282;138;beneath its leaning side, appears to fall;kirkpatrick
1;31;4283;139;if any ﬂoating cloud should pass behind,;kirkpatrick
1;31;4284;140;so, too, Antaeus seemed to me, as there;kirkpatrick
1;31;4285;141;I stood expecting him to bend. And now;kirkpatrick
1;31;4286;142;I’d willingly have gone some other way.;kirkpatrick
1;31;4287;143;Yet lightly he set us, lightly, in those depths;kirkpatrick
1;31;4288;144;that eat at Lucifer and Judas, too.;kirkpatrick
1;31;4289;145;He did not, bowing so, make long delay,;kirkpatrick
1;31;4290;146;but swayed again up straight as ship masts do.;kirkpatrick
1;32;4291;1;If I had rhymes that rawly rasped and cackled;kirkpatrick
1;32;4292;2;(and chimed in keeping with that cacky hole;kirkpatrick
1;32;4293;3;at which, point down, all other rock rings peak),  I might;kirkpatrick
1;32;4294;4;then squeeze the juices of my thought;kirkpatrick
1;32;4295;5;more fully out of me. But since I don’t,;kirkpatrick
1;32;4296;6;not without dread, I bring myself to speak.;kirkpatrick
1;32;4297;7;It’s not (no kidding) any sort of joke;kirkpatrick
1;32;4298;8;to form in words the universal bum,;kirkpatrick
1;32;4299;9;no task for tongues still whimpering ‘Mum!’ and ‘Dad!’;kirkpatrick
1;32;4300;10;The Muses, though, may raise my verse – women;kirkpatrick
1;32;4301;11;who once helped Amphion lock Thebes in walls –;kirkpatrick
1;32;4302;12;so fact and word may not too far diverge.;kirkpatrick
1;32;4303;13;You ill-begotten zombies, worst of all,;kirkpatrick
1;32;4304;14;who stand there where to utter is so hard,;kirkpatrick
1;32;4305;15;better had you been born as sheep or bezoars!;kirkpatrick
1;32;4306;16;Now deep within the darkness of that well;kirkpatrick
1;32;4307;17;and further even than those giant feet,;kirkpatrick
1;32;4308;18;I stood and gazed sheer upwards at that wall;kirkpatrick
1;32;4309;19;when, out of nowhere, I heard: ‘Watch your step!;kirkpatrick
1;32;4310;20;"Don’t plant those feet of yours on some poor head; we’re";kirkpatrick
1;32;4311;21;here all brothers in this sorry crowd.’;kirkpatrick
1;32;4312;22;I turned at this, and now could see – around,;kirkpatrick
1;32;4313;23;and all beneath, my feet – a lake of ice;kirkpatrick
1;32;4314;24;that seemed far less like water than clear glass.;kirkpatrick
1;32;4315;25;The Danube, even in winter Österreich,;kirkpatrick
1;32;4316;26;never congealed its currents to so thick;kirkpatrick
1;32;4317;27;a veil (the Don, neither, under freezing skies);kirkpatrick
1;32;4318;28;as this. And if the crags of Tambernic;kirkpatrick
1;32;4319;29;had crashed down here – or Pike Pietrapana –;kirkpatrick
1;32;4320;30;its very fringe would not have cracked or creaked.;kirkpatrick
1;32;4321;31;As frogs sit croaking in the harvest month;kirkpatrick
1;32;4322;32;(when country girls will dream of gleaning corn), their;kirkpatrick
1;32;4323;33;snouts just poking from the water line,;kirkpatrick
1;32;4324;34;so too these shadows, ﬁxed in ice lead-blue,;kirkpatrick
1;32;4325;35;to where, in shame, we start to blush, their teeth as;kirkpatrick
1;32;4326;36;rhythmic, beakily, as chattering storks.;kirkpatrick
1;32;4327;37;And each one kept his face bent down. From mouths;kirkpatrick
1;32;4328;38;the cold, from hearts their miseries force;kirkpatrick
1;32;4329;39;a public testament to suﬀering.;kirkpatrick
1;32;4330;40;I stood a while just gazing all around,;kirkpatrick
1;32;4331;41;then, glancing to my feet, I saw here two;kirkpatrick
1;32;4332;42;embraced so closely that their head hair mixed.;kirkpatrick
1;32;4333;43;‘Go on,’ I said, ‘so tell me who you are,;kirkpatrick
1;32;4334;44;straining so tightly, tit to tit.’ Coupled,;kirkpatrick
1;32;4335;45;the two eased back their necks. Their faces now;kirkpatrick
1;32;4336;46;were straight to mine. Once moist within, their eyes;kirkpatrick
1;32;4337;47;welled up. The teardrops ﬂowed toward their lips.;kirkpatrick
1;32;4338;48;But chill gripped these, to lock them in their holes.;kirkpatrick
1;32;4339;49;To wood wood never has been clamped so hard;kirkpatrick
1;32;4340;50;"as these two were; and, overwhelmed with ire,";kirkpatrick
1;32;4341;51;each butted each like any pair of goats.;kirkpatrick
1;32;4342;52;Another in the frost had lost both ears.;kirkpatrick
1;32;4343;53;Still gazing downwards, he was ﬁrst to speak:;kirkpatrick
1;32;4344;54;‘Why eye us so, as though we were your mirror?;kirkpatrick
1;32;4345;55;If you’re so keen to know who these two are,;kirkpatrick
1;32;4346;56;that valley where Bisenzio streams down;kirkpatrick
1;32;4347;57;belonged to them, as to their father, earlier.;kirkpatrick
1;32;4348;58;They issued from a single womb. And you;kirkpatrick
1;32;4349;59;may go, if you so please, through all of Cain;kirkpatrick
1;32;4350;60;ﬁnding no shadow freeze in aspic ﬁtter,;kirkpatrick
1;32;4351;61;not Mordred, even – breast and shadow pierced;kirkpatrick
1;32;4352;62;by thrusts his “uncle”, great King Arthur, gave – neither;kirkpatrick
1;32;4353;63;Focaccia (source of strife), nor this one here,  whose;kirkpatrick
1;32;4354;64;head, annoyingly, so cramps my view.;kirkpatrick
1;32;4355;65;His name was Sassolo Mascheroni,;kirkpatrick
1;32;4356;66;and you, if you are Tuscan, know him well.;kirkpatrick
1;32;4357;67;However, not to drag out speeches further,;kirkpatrick
1;32;4358;68;be told that I’m Camiscion de’ Pazzi.;kirkpatrick
1;32;4359;69;I wait for Carlin. He’ll acquit me here.’;kirkpatrick
1;32;4360;70;And then I saw a thousand mongrel faces;kirkpatrick
1;32;4361;71;bitten by frost. (I shiver, remembering –;kirkpatrick
1;32;4362;72;and always will – to see a frozen puddle.);kirkpatrick
1;32;4363;73;Trembling, as ever, in the endless nip,;kirkpatrick
1;32;4364;74;onwards we went to reach the cone’s last core,;kirkpatrick
1;32;4365;75;where all the weight of everything weighs down.;kirkpatrick
1;32;4366;76;And whether by intention, chance or fate;kirkpatrick
1;32;4367;77;(well, I don’t know!) pacing among these heads,;kirkpatrick
1;32;4368;78;hard in the face of one, I struck my foot.;kirkpatrick
1;32;4369;79;It screeched out, whingingly: ‘Why stamp on me?;kirkpatrick
1;32;4370;80;Unless, of course, you’re here to take revenge;kirkpatrick
1;32;4371;81;for Montaperti. If not, why do me harm?’;kirkpatrick
1;32;4372;82;I to my teacher: ‘Wait a little here.;kirkpatrick
1;32;4373;83;I’ll go and free myself of doubts with him.;kirkpatrick
1;32;4374;84;Then push me on as much as you desire.’;kirkpatrick
1;32;4375;85;My leader paused. And, turning to the one;kirkpatrick
1;32;4376;86;still spitting curses out, I now inquired:;kirkpatrick
1;32;4377;87;‘So who are you, to go on scolding others?’;kirkpatrick
1;32;4378;88;‘And who are you? You trek through Antenora,;kirkpatrick
1;32;4379;89;bashing,’ he said, ‘at other people’s cheeks.;kirkpatrick
1;32;4380;90;Were you alive, I wouldn’t stand for it.’;kirkpatrick
1;32;4381;91;‘I am alive,’ I answered him. ‘How dear to you;kirkpatrick
1;32;4382;92;I might become, if fame is what you thirst for!;kirkpatrick
1;32;4383;93;I could well note your name among the rest.’;kirkpatrick
1;32;4384;94;‘I yearn,’ he answered, ‘for the opposite.;kirkpatrick
1;32;4385;95;Just go away and give me no more grief.;kirkpatrick
1;32;4386;96;You don’t know how to ﬂatter in a bog like this.’;kirkpatrick
1;32;4387;97;And so I grasped him tight against the scalp.;kirkpatrick
1;32;4388;98;‘You’ll name yourself,’ I said to him. ‘If not,;kirkpatrick
1;32;4389;99;you’ll ﬁnd no single bristle on your topknot.’;kirkpatrick
1;32;4390;100;‘Don’t think,’ he said, ‘because you pluck my curls,;kirkpatrick
1;32;4391;101;I mean to say or show you bugger all,;kirkpatrick
1;32;4392;102;bomb as you may my skull ten thousand times.’;kirkpatrick
1;32;4393;103;I’d got him twisted in my ﬁngers now,;kirkpatrick
1;32;4394;104;and had, already, yanked out several tufts.;kirkpatrick
1;32;4395;105;He barked, but kept his eyes held ﬁrmly down.;kirkpatrick
1;32;4396;106;Another yelling now: ‘What’s with you, Big Mouth?;kirkpatrick
1;32;4397;107;Not satisﬁed to castanet cold jaws?;kirkpatrick
1;32;4398;108;You bark as well. What devil’s got to you?’;kirkpatrick
1;32;4399;109;And then I said: ‘I’d have you speak no more.;kirkpatrick
1;32;4400;110;You’re vile, you traitor. I’ll augment your shame, I’ll carry;kirkpatrick
1;32;4401;111;in your name a true report.’;kirkpatrick
1;32;4402;112;‘Go on,’ he answered, ‘gossip all you like.;kirkpatrick
1;32;4403;113;But don’t, if you get out of here, be silent;kirkpatrick
1;32;4404;114;concerning him, his tongue so slick.;kirkpatrick
1;32;4405;115;He weeps for having ﬁngered French-y silver.;kirkpatrick
1;32;4406;116;Now you can say: “I saw that man from Duera.;kirkpatrick
1;32;4407;117;He dwells where all the sinners keep quite cool.”;kirkpatrick
1;32;4408;118;And should you ask me: “Are there others here?”;kirkpatrick
1;32;4409;119;Beside you, there is Abbot Beccheria,;kirkpatrick
1;32;4410;120;the one whose gizzard Florence sawed right through.;kirkpatrick
1;32;4411;121;Then Ghibelline Jack, I guess, is further on,;kirkpatrick
1;32;4412;122;with Ganelon and Tebaldello, too.;kirkpatrick
1;32;4413;123;He slid the doors of sleeping Faience back.’;kirkpatrick
1;32;4414;124;By now we had already gone our way.;kirkpatrick
1;32;4415;125;But then I saw two frozen in one single hole,;kirkpatrick
1;32;4416;126;one head a headpiece to the one below.;kirkpatrick
1;32;4417;127;As bread is mangled by some famished mouth,;kirkpatrick
1;32;4418;128;so too the higher gnawed the lower head,;kirkpatrick
1;32;4419;129;precisely where the nape and brainstem meet.;kirkpatrick
1;32;4420;130;The dying Tydeus in this same way,;kirkpatrick
1;32;4421;131;in loathing, chewed the brows of dead Menalippus,;kirkpatrick
1;32;4422;132;gnawing the skull and everything besides.;kirkpatrick
1;32;4423;133;‘O you who by so bestial a show;kirkpatrick
1;32;4424;134;make known your hatred for the one you eat,;kirkpatrick
1;32;4425;135;now tell me – why? I give my word,’ I said,;kirkpatrick
1;32;4426;136;‘if you complain of him with proper cause,;kirkpatrick
1;32;4427;137;then once I know his name and how he sinned,;kirkpatrick
1;32;4428;138;I’ll make you in the world a fair return,;kirkpatrick
1;32;4429;139;provided means of speech do not fall dry.’;kirkpatrick
1;33;4430;1;Jaws lifted now from that horrible dish,;kirkpatrick
1;33;4431;2;the sinner – wiping each lip clean on hair that fringed the;kirkpatrick
1;33;4432;3;mess he’d left the head in, at its rear –  began: ‘You ask;kirkpatrick
1;33;4433;4;that I should tell anew;kirkpatrick
1;33;4434;5;the pain that hopelessly, in thought alone,;kirkpatrick
1;33;4435;6;before I voice it, presses at my heart.;kirkpatrick
1;33;4436;7;Yet if I may, by speaking, sow the fruit;kirkpatrick
1;33;4437;8;of hate to slur this traitor, caught between my teeth, then;kirkpatrick
1;33;4438;9;words and tears, you’ll see, will ﬂow as one.;kirkpatrick
1;33;4439;10;Who you might be, I do not know, nor how;kirkpatrick
1;33;4440;11;you’ve come to be down here. But when you speak,;kirkpatrick
1;33;4441;12;you seem (there’s little doubt) a Florentine.;kirkpatrick
1;33;4442;13;You need to see: I was Count Ugolino.;kirkpatrick
1;33;4443;14;This is Ruggieri, the archbishop, there.;kirkpatrick
1;33;4444;15;I’ll tell you now why we two are so close.;kirkpatrick
1;33;4445;16;That I, in consequence of his vile thoughts,;kirkpatrick
1;33;4446;17;was captured – though I trusted in this man –;kirkpatrick
1;33;4447;18;and after died, I do not need to say.;kirkpatrick
1;33;4448;19;But this cannot have carried to your ears:;kirkpatrick
1;33;4449;20;that is, how savagely I met my death.;kirkpatrick
1;33;4450;21;You’ll hear it now, and know if he has injured me.;kirkpatrick
1;33;4451;22;One scant slit in the walls of Eaglehouse;kirkpatrick
1;33;4452;23;(because of me, they call it now the Hunger Tower.;kirkpatrick
1;33;4453;24;Be sure, though: others will be locked up there);kirkpatrick
1;33;4454;25;had shown me, in the shaft that pierces it,;kirkpatrick
1;33;4455;26;many new moons by now, when this bad dream;kirkpatrick
1;33;4456;27;tore wide the veil of what my future was.;kirkpatrick
1;33;4457;28;This thing here then appeared to me as Master;kirkpatrick
1;33;4458;29;of the Hounds, who tracked the wolf – his cubs as well –;kirkpatrick
1;33;4459;30;out on the hill where Lucca hides from Pisa.;kirkpatrick
1;33;4460;31;In front, as leaders of the pack, he placed;kirkpatrick
1;33;4461;32;the clans Gualandi, Sismond and Lanfranchi,;kirkpatrick
1;33;4462;33;their bitches hunting eager, lean and smart.;kirkpatrick
1;33;4463;34;The chase was brief. Father and sons, it seemed,;kirkpatrick
1;33;4464;35;"were wearying; and soon – or so it seemed –";kirkpatrick
1;33;4465;36;I saw those sharp fangs raking down their ﬂanks.;kirkpatrick
1;33;4466;37;I woke before the day ahead had come,;kirkpatrick
1;33;4467;38;and heard my sons (my little ones were there);kirkpatrick
1;33;4468;39;cry in their sleep and call out for some food.;kirkpatrick
1;33;4469;40;How hard you are if, thinking what my heart;kirkpatrick
1;33;4470;41;foretold, you do not feel the pain of it.;kirkpatrick
1;33;4471;42;Whatever will you weep for, if not that?;kirkpatrick
1;33;4472;43;By now they all had woken up. The time;kirkpatrick
1;33;4473;44;was due when, as routine, our food was brought.;kirkpatrick
1;33;4474;45;Yet each was doubtful, thinking of their dream.;kirkpatrick
1;33;4475;46;Listening, I heard the door below locked shut,;kirkpatrick
1;33;4476;47;then nailed in place against that dreadful tower.;kirkpatrick
1;33;4477;48;I looked in their dear faces, spoke no word.;kirkpatrick
1;33;4478;49;I did not weep. Inward, I turned to stone.;kirkpatrick
1;33;4479;50;They wept. And then my boy Anselmo spoke:;kirkpatrick
1;33;4480;51;“What are you staring at? Father, what’s wrong?”;kirkpatrick
1;33;4481;52;And so I held my tears in check and gave;kirkpatrick
1;33;4482;53;no answer all that day, nor all the night;kirkpatrick
1;33;4483;54;that followed on, until another sun came up.;kirkpatrick
1;33;4484;55;A little light had forced a ray into;kirkpatrick
1;33;4485;56;our prison, so full of pain. I now could see;kirkpatrick
1;33;4486;57;on all four faces my own expression.;kirkpatrick
1;33;4487;58;Out of sheer grief, I gnawed on both my hands.;kirkpatrick
1;33;4488;59;And they – who thought I did so from an urge;kirkpatrick
1;33;4489;60;to eat – all, on the instant, rose and said:;kirkpatrick
1;33;4490;61;“Father, for us the pain would be far less;kirkpatrick
1;33;4491;62;if you would chose to eat us. You, having dressed us in this;kirkpatrick
1;33;4492;63;wretched ﬂesh, ought now to strip it oﬀ.”;kirkpatrick
1;33;4493;64;So I kept still, to not increase their miseries.;kirkpatrick
1;33;4494;65;And that day and the day beyond, we all were mute.;kirkpatrick
1;33;4495;66;Hard, cruel earth, why did you not gape wide?;kirkpatrick
1;33;4496;67;As then we reached the fourth of all those days,;kirkpatrick
1;33;4497;68;Gaddo pitched forward, stretching at my feet.;kirkpatrick
1;33;4498;69;“Help me,” he said. “Why don’t you help me, Dad!”;kirkpatrick
1;33;4499;70;And there he died. You see me here. So I saw them,;kirkpatrick
1;33;4500;71;the three remaining, falling one by one;kirkpatrick
1;33;4501;72;between the next days – ﬁve and six – then let;kirkpatrick
1;33;4502;73;myself, now blind, feel over them, calling;kirkpatrick
1;33;4503;74;on each, now all were dead, for two days more.;kirkpatrick
1;33;4504;75;Then hunger proved a greater power than grief.’;kirkpatrick
1;33;4505;76;His words were done. Now, eyes askew, he grabbed;kirkpatrick
1;33;4506;77;once more that miserable skull – his teeth,;kirkpatrick
1;33;4507;78;like any dog’s teeth, strong against the bone.;kirkpatrick
1;33;4508;79;Pisa, you scandal of the lovely land;kirkpatrick
1;33;4509;80;where ‘yes’ is uttered in the form of sì ,;kirkpatrick
1;33;4510;81;your neighbours may be slow to punish you,;kirkpatrick
1;33;4511;82;but let those reefs, Capraia and Gorgogna,;kirkpatrick
1;33;4512;83;drift, as a barrage, to the Arno’s mouth,;kirkpatrick
1;33;4513;84;so that your people – every one – are drowned.;kirkpatrick
1;33;4514;85;So what if – as the rumour goes – the great Count;kirkpatrick
1;33;4515;86;Ugolino did cheat fortresses from you.;kirkpatrick
1;33;4516;87;You had no right to crucify his children.;kirkpatrick
1;33;4517;88;Pisa, you are a newborn Thebes! Those boys;kirkpatrick
1;33;4518;89;were young. That made them innocent. I’ve named;kirkpatrick
1;33;4519;90;just two. I now name Uguiccione and Brigata.;kirkpatrick
1;33;4520;91;We now moved on, and came to where the ice;kirkpatrick
1;33;4521;92;so roughly swaddled yet another brood.;kirkpatrick
1;33;4522;93;And these – not hunched – bend back for all to view.;kirkpatrick
1;33;4523;94;They weep. Yet weeping does not let them weep.;kirkpatrick
1;33;4524;95;Their anguish meets a blockage at the eye.;kirkpatrick
1;33;4525;96;Turned in, this only makes their heartache more.;kirkpatrick
1;33;4526;97;Their tears ﬁrst cluster into frozen buds,;kirkpatrick
1;33;4527;98;and then – as though a crystal visor – ﬁll;kirkpatrick
1;33;4528;99;the socket of the eye beneath each brow.;kirkpatrick
1;33;4529;100;My own face now – a callus in the chill –;kirkpatrick
1;33;4530;101;had ceased to be a throne to any kind;kirkpatrick
1;33;4531;102;of sentiment. And yet, in spite of all,;kirkpatrick
1;33;4532;103;it seemed I felt a wind still stirring here.;kirkpatrick
1;33;4533;104;‘Who moves these currents, sir?’ I now inquired.;kirkpatrick
1;33;4534;105;‘At depths like these, aren’t vapours wholly spent?’;kirkpatrick
1;33;4535;106;He in reply: ‘Come on, come on! You soon;kirkpatrick
1;33;4536;107;will stand where your own probing eye shall see;kirkpatrick
1;33;4537;108;what brings this drizzling exhalation on.’;kirkpatrick
1;33;4538;109;A case of icy-eye-scab now yelled out:;kirkpatrick
1;33;4539;110;‘You must be souls of such malignancy;kirkpatrick
1;33;4540;111;you merit placement in the lowest hole.;kirkpatrick
1;33;4541;112;Prise oﬀ this rigid veil, to clear my eyes.;kirkpatrick
1;33;4542;113;Let me awhile express the grief that swells;kirkpatrick
1;33;4543;114;in my heart’s womb before my tears next freeze.’;kirkpatrick
1;33;4544;115;I answered: ‘Are you asking help from me?;kirkpatrick
1;33;4545;116;Tell me who you are. Then I’ll free your gaze,;kirkpatrick
1;33;4546;117;or travel – promise! – to the deepest ice.’;kirkpatrick
1;33;4547;118;‘I,’ he replied, ‘am Brother Alberigo,;kirkpatrick
1;33;4548;119;I of the Evil Orchard, Fruiterer.;kirkpatrick
1;33;4549;120;Here I receive exquisite dates for ﬁgs.’;kirkpatrick
1;33;4550;121;‘Oh,’ I now said, ‘so you’re already dead?’;kirkpatrick
1;33;4551;122;‘Well, how my body fares above,’ he said,;kirkpatrick
1;33;4552;123;‘still in the world, my knowledge is not sure.;kirkpatrick
1;33;4553;124;There is, in Ptolomea, this advantage,;kirkpatrick
1;33;4554;125;that souls will frequently come falling down;kirkpatrick
1;33;4555;126;before Fate Atropos has granted them discharge.;kirkpatrick
1;33;4556;127;I very willingly will tell you more,;kirkpatrick
1;33;4557;128;but only scrape this tear-glaze from my face.;kirkpatrick
1;33;4558;129;The instant any soul commits, like me,;kirkpatrick
1;33;4559;130;some act of treachery, a demon takes;kirkpatrick
1;33;4560;131;possession of that body-form and rules;kirkpatrick
1;33;4561;132;its deeds until its time is done. Swirling,;kirkpatrick
1;33;4562;133;the soul runs downwards to this sink. And so;kirkpatrick
1;33;4563;134;the body of that shade behind – a-twitter;kirkpatrick
1;33;4564;135;all this winter through – still seems up there, perhaps.;kirkpatrick
1;33;4565;136;You’re bound to know, arriving only now,;kirkpatrick
1;33;4566;137;that this is Signor Branca (“Hookhand”) d’Oria.;kirkpatrick
1;33;4567;138;Years have gone by since he was ice-packed here.’;kirkpatrick
1;33;4568;139;‘I think,’ I said, ‘that this must be a con.;kirkpatrick
1;33;4569;140;For how can Branca d’Oria be dead?;kirkpatrick
1;33;4570;141;He eats and drinks and sleeps and puts his clothes on.’;kirkpatrick
1;33;4571;142;‘Recall that ditch,’ he said, ‘named Rotklorsville,;kirkpatrick
1;33;4572;143;where, higher up, they brew adhesive pitch?;kirkpatrick
1;33;4573;144;Well, long before Mike Zanche got to that,;kirkpatrick
1;33;4574;145;Hookhand was history. He, as proxy, left;kirkpatrick
1;33;4575;146;a devil in his skin (his kinsman’s here as well,;kirkpatrick
1;33;4576;147;the one who planned with him the double-cross).;kirkpatrick
1;33;4577;148;But please, now reach your hand to me down here.;kirkpatrick
1;33;4578;149;Open my eyes for me.’ I did not open them.;kirkpatrick
1;33;4579;150;To be a swine in this case was pure courtesy.;kirkpatrick
1;33;4580;151;You Genovese, deviant, deranged;kirkpatrick
1;33;4581;152;and stuﬀed with every sort of vicious canker!;kirkpatrick
1;33;4582;153;Why have you not been wiped yet from the earth?;kirkpatrick
1;33;4583;154;Among the worst of all the Romagnuoli;kirkpatrick
1;33;4584;155;I found there one of yours, whose works were such;kirkpatrick
1;33;4585;156;his soul already bathes in Cocytus.;kirkpatrick
1;33;4586;157;His body, seemingly, lives on above.;kirkpatrick
1;34;4587;1;‘Vexilla regis prodeunt inferni ,;kirkpatrick
1;34;4588;2;marching towards us. Fix your eyes ahead,’;kirkpatrick
1;34;4589;3;my teacher said, ‘and see if you can see it.’;kirkpatrick
1;34;4590;4;As though a windmill when a thick fog breathes –;kirkpatrick
1;34;4591;5;or else when dark night grips our hemisphere – seen from;kirkpatrick
1;34;4592;6;a distance, turning in the wind,;kirkpatrick
1;34;4593;7;so there a great contraption had appeared.;kirkpatrick
1;34;4594;8;And I now shrank, against the wind, behind;kirkpatrick
1;34;4595;9;my guide. There were no glades to shelter in.;kirkpatrick
1;34;4596;10;I was by now (I write this verse in fear);kirkpatrick
1;34;4597;11;where all the shades in ice were covered up,;kirkpatrick
1;34;4598;12;transparent as are straws preserved in glass.;kirkpatrick
1;34;4599;13;Some lay there ﬂat, and some were vertical,;kirkpatrick
1;34;4600;14;one with head raised, another soles aloft,;kirkpatrick
1;34;4601;15;another like a bow, bent face to feet.;kirkpatrick
1;34;4602;16;And then when we had got still further on,;kirkpatrick
1;34;4603;17;where now my master chose to show to me;kirkpatrick
1;34;4604;18;that creature who had once appeared so fair,;kirkpatrick
1;34;4605;19;he drew away from me and made me stop,;kirkpatrick
1;34;4606;20;saying: ‘Now see! Great Dis! Now see the place where you;kirkpatrick
1;34;4607;21;will need to put on all your strength.’;kirkpatrick
1;34;4608;22;How weak I now became, how faded, dry –;kirkpatrick
1;34;4609;23;reader, don’t ask, I shall not write it down – for anything I;kirkpatrick
1;34;4610;24;said would fall far short.;kirkpatrick
1;34;4611;25;I neither died nor wholly stayed alive.;kirkpatrick
1;34;4612;26;Just think yourselves, if your minds are in ﬂower, what I;kirkpatrick
1;34;4613;27;became, bereft of life and death.;kirkpatrick
1;34;4614;28;The emperor of all these realms of gloom;kirkpatrick
1;34;4615;29;stuck from the ice at mid-point on his breast.;kirkpatrick
1;34;4616;30;And I am more a giant (to compare);kirkpatrick
1;34;4617;31;than any giant measured to his arm.;kirkpatrick
1;34;4618;32;So now you’ll see how huge the whole must be,;kirkpatrick
1;34;4619;33;when viewed in ﬁt proportion to that limb.;kirkpatrick
1;34;4620;34;If, once, he was as lovely as now vile,;kirkpatrick
1;34;4621;35;when ﬁrst he raised his brow against his maker, then truly;kirkpatrick
1;34;4622;36;grief must all proceed from him.;kirkpatrick
1;34;4623;37;How great a wonder it now seemed to me;kirkpatrick
1;34;4624;38;to see three faces on a single head!;kirkpatrick
1;34;4625;39;The forward face was bright vermilion.;kirkpatrick
1;34;4626;40;The other two attached themselves to that;kirkpatrick
1;34;4627;41;along each shoulder on the central point,;kirkpatrick
1;34;4628;42;and joined together at the crest of hair.;kirkpatrick
1;34;4629;43;The rightward face was whitish, dirty yellow.;kirkpatrick
1;34;4630;44;The left in colour had the tint of those;kirkpatrick
1;34;4631;45;beyond the source from which the Nile ﬁrst swells.;kirkpatrick
1;34;4632;46;Behind each face there issued two great vanes,;kirkpatrick
1;34;4633;47;all six proportioned to a fowl like this.;kirkpatrick
1;34;4634;48;I never saw such size in ocean sails.;kirkpatrick
1;34;4635;49;Not feathered as a bird’s wings are, bat-like;kirkpatrick
1;34;4636;50;and leathery, each fanned away the air,;kirkpatrick
1;34;4637;51;so three unchanging winds moved out from him,;kirkpatrick
1;34;4638;52;Cocytus being frozen hard by these.;kirkpatrick
1;34;4639;53;He wept from all six eyes. And down each chin;kirkpatrick
1;34;4640;54;both tears and bloody slobber slowly ran.;kirkpatrick
1;34;4641;55;In every mouth he mangled with his teeth;kirkpatrick
1;34;4642;56;(as ﬂax combs do) a single sinning soul,;kirkpatrick
1;34;4643;57;but brought this agony to three at once.;kirkpatrick
1;34;4644;58;Such biting, though, aﬀects the soul in front;kirkpatrick
1;34;4645;59;as nothing to the scratching he received.;kirkpatrick
1;34;4646;60;His spine at times showed starkly, bare of skin.;kirkpatrick
1;34;4647;61;‘That one up there, condemned to greater pain,;kirkpatrick
1;34;4648;62;is Judas Iscariot,’ my teacher said,;kirkpatrick
1;34;4649;63;‘his head inside, his feet out, wriggling hard.;kirkpatrick
1;34;4650;64;The other two, their heads hung down below,;kirkpatrick
1;34;4651;65;are Brutus, dangling from the jet black snout;kirkpatrick
1;34;4652;66;(look how he writhes there, uttering not a word!),  the;kirkpatrick
1;34;4653;67;other Cassius with burly look.;kirkpatrick
1;34;4654;68;But night ascends once more. And now it’s time for us to;kirkpatrick
1;34;4655;69;quit this hole. We’ve seen it all.’;kirkpatrick
1;34;4656;70;As he desired, I clung around his neck.;kirkpatrick
1;34;4657;71;With purpose, he selected time and place;kirkpatrick
1;34;4658;72;and, when the wings had opened to the full,;kirkpatrick
1;34;4659;73;he took a handhold on the furry sides,;kirkpatrick
1;34;4660;74;and then, from tuft to tuft, he travelled down between the;kirkpatrick
1;34;4661;75;shaggy pelt and frozen crust.;kirkpatrick
1;34;4662;76;But then, arriving where the thigh bone turns;kirkpatrick
1;34;4663;77;(the hips extended to their widest there),;kirkpatrick
1;34;4664;78;my leader, with the utmost stress and strain,;kirkpatrick
1;34;4665;79;swivelled his head to where his shanks had been;kirkpatrick
1;34;4666;80;and clutched the pelt like someone on a climb, so now I;kirkpatrick
1;34;4667;81;thought: ‘We’re heading back to Hell.’;kirkpatrick
1;34;4668;82;‘Take care,’ my teacher said. ‘By steps like these,’;kirkpatrick
1;34;4669;83;breathless and panting, seemingly all-in,;kirkpatrick
1;34;4670;84;‘we need to take our leave of so much ill.’;kirkpatrick
1;34;4671;85;Then through a ﬁssure in that rock he passed;kirkpatrick
1;34;4672;86;and set me down to perch there on its rim.;kirkpatrick
1;34;4673;87;After, he stretched his careful stride towards me.;kirkpatrick
1;34;4674;88;Raising my eyes, I thought that I should see;kirkpatrick
1;34;4675;89;Lucifer where I, just now, had left him,;kirkpatrick
1;34;4676;90;but saw instead his legs held upwards there.;kirkpatrick
1;34;4677;91;If I was struggling then to understand,;kirkpatrick
1;34;4678;92;let other dimwits think how they’d have failed to see what;kirkpatrick
1;34;4679;93;point it was that I now passed.;kirkpatrick
1;34;4680;94;‘Up on your feet!’ my teacher ordered me.;kirkpatrick
1;34;4681;95;‘The way is long, the road is cruelly hard.;kirkpatrick
1;34;4682;96;The sun is at the morning bell already.’;kirkpatrick
1;34;4683;97;This was no stroll, where now we had arrived,;kirkpatrick
1;34;4684;98;through any palace but a natural cave.;kirkpatrick
1;34;4685;99;The ground beneath was rough, the light was weak.;kirkpatrick
1;34;4686;100;‘Before my roots are torn from this abyss,;kirkpatrick
1;34;4687;101;sir,’ I said, upright, ‘to untangle me;kirkpatrick
1;34;4688;102;from error, say a little more of this.;kirkpatrick
1;34;4689;103;Where is the ice? And why is that one there;kirkpatrick
1;34;4690;104;ﬁxed upside down? How is it that the sun;kirkpatrick
1;34;4691;105;progressed so rapidly from evening on to day?’;kirkpatrick
1;34;4692;106;And he in answer: ‘You suppose you’re still;kirkpatrick
1;34;4693;107;on that side of the centre where I gripped;kirkpatrick
1;34;4694;108;that wormrot’s coat that pierces all the world.;kirkpatrick
1;34;4695;109;While I was still descending, you were there.;kirkpatrick
1;34;4696;110;But once I turned, you crossed, with me, the point to;kirkpatrick
1;34;4697;111;which from every part all weight drags down.;kirkpatrick
1;34;4698;112;So you stand here beneath the hemisphere;kirkpatrick
1;34;4699;113;that now is covered wholly with dry land,;kirkpatrick
1;34;4700;114;under the highest point at which there died;kirkpatrick
1;34;4701;115;the one man sinless in his birth and life.;kirkpatrick
1;34;4702;116;Your feet are set upon a little sphere;kirkpatrick
1;34;4703;117;that forms the other aspect of Giudecca.;kirkpatrick
1;34;4704;118;It’s morning here. It’s evening over there.;kirkpatrick
1;34;4705;119;The thing that made a ladder of his hair;kirkpatrick
1;34;4706;120;is still as ﬁxed as he has always been.;kirkpatrick
1;34;4707;121;Falling from Heaven, when he reached this side,;kirkpatrick
1;34;4708;122;the lands that then spread out to southern parts in fear of;kirkpatrick
1;34;4709;123;him took on a veil of sea.;kirkpatrick
1;34;4710;124;These reached our hemisphere. Whatever now;kirkpatrick
1;34;4711;125;is visible to us – in ﬂight perhaps from him – took refuge;kirkpatrick
1;34;4712;126;here and left an empty space.’;kirkpatrick
1;34;4713;127;There is a place (as distant from Beelzebub;kirkpatrick
1;34;4714;128;as his own tomb extends in breadth);kirkpatrick
1;34;4715;129;known not by sight but rather by the sound;kirkpatrick
1;34;4716;130;of waters falling in a rivulet;kirkpatrick
1;34;4717;131;eroding, by the winding course it takes (which is not very;kirkpatrick
1;34;4718;132;steep), an opening in that rock.;kirkpatrick
1;34;4719;133;So now we entered on that hidden path,;kirkpatrick
1;34;4720;134;my lord and I, to move once more towards;kirkpatrick
1;34;4721;135;a shining world. We did not care to rest.;kirkpatrick
1;34;4722;136;We climbed, he going ﬁrst and I behind,;kirkpatrick
1;34;4723;137;until through some small aperture I saw;kirkpatrick
1;34;4724;138;the lovely things the skies above us bear.;kirkpatrick
1;34;4725;139;Now we came out, and once more saw the stars.;kirkpatrick
2;1;4726;1;To race now over better waves, my ship;kirkpatrick
2;1;4727;2;of mind – alive again – hoists sail, and leaves;kirkpatrick
2;1;4728;3;behind its little keel the gulf that proved so cruel.;kirkpatrick
2;1;4729;4;And I’ll sing, now, about that second realm;kirkpatrick
2;1;4730;5;where human spirits purge themselves from stain,;kirkpatrick
2;1;4731;6;becoming worthy to ascend to Heaven.;kirkpatrick
2;1;4732;7;Here, too, dead poetry will rise again.;kirkpatrick
2;1;4733;8;For now, you sacred Muses, I am yours.;kirkpatrick
2;1;4734;9;So let Calliope, a little, play her part,;kirkpatrick
2;1;4735;10;and follow as I sing, with chords that scourged;kirkpatrick
2;1;4736;11;the wretched Magpies (young girls, once) till they;kirkpatrick
2;1;4737;12;despaired of pardon for their insolence.;kirkpatrick
2;1;4738;13;Soft hues of sapphire from the orient,;kirkpatrick
2;1;4739;14;collecting gently, marked the circles now;kirkpatrick
2;1;4740;15;of skies serene from height to horizon.;kirkpatrick
2;1;4741;16;And this sight – once I left the morbid air,;kirkpatrick
2;1;4742;17;which weighed so heavy on my eyes and heart –;kirkpatrick
2;1;4743;18;began afresh to bring my eyes delight.;kirkpatrick
2;1;4744;19;The lovely planet, strengthening to our love,;kirkpatrick
2;1;4745;20;lit up with laughter all the orient sky,;kirkpatrick
2;1;4746;21;veiling her escort, Pisces, in bright light.;kirkpatrick
2;1;4747;22;I turned now to the right. I set my mind;kirkpatrick
2;1;4748;23;up on the southern pole, and saw four stars;kirkpatrick
2;1;4749;24;that none – save Eve and Adam – ever saw.;kirkpatrick
2;1;4750;25;The heavens, it seemed, rejoiced in these four gleams.;kirkpatrick
2;1;4751;26;Oh widowed North (your name means seven stars),;kirkpatrick
2;1;4752;27;how great your lack, to never look on those!;kirkpatrick
2;1;4753;28;I made my gaze, at last, abandon them,;kirkpatrick
2;1;4754;29;and turning back to glimpse the other pole –;kirkpatrick
2;1;4755;30;from which the Wain, already, had gone down –;kirkpatrick
2;1;4756;31;I saw nearby an old man on his own,;kirkpatrick
2;1;4757;32;deserving (from the air and look he had);kirkpatrick
2;1;4758;33;of all respect a son might give his sire.;kirkpatrick
2;1;4759;34;The beard he wore was long and ﬂecked with white,;kirkpatrick
2;1;4760;35;as, too, the hair that ﬂowed down from his head, falling;kirkpatrick
2;1;4761;36;upon his breast in double braids.;kirkpatrick
2;1;4762;37;The rays that shot from those four holy stars;kirkpatrick
2;1;4763;38;adorned his brow with honour so I saw;kirkpatrick
2;1;4764;39;his face as clear as if the sun shone there.;kirkpatrick
2;1;4765;40;‘And who are you, you fugitives who ﬂee,;kirkpatrick
2;1;4766;41;across the unseeing stream, eternal gaol?’;kirkpatrick
2;1;4767;42;He spoke, and moved his beard in noble plumes.;kirkpatrick
2;1;4768;43;‘Who was your guide? What lantern led you on;kirkpatrick
2;1;4769;44;beyond those deepest reaches of the night;kirkpatrick
2;1;4770;45;that make the vale of Hell for ever black?;kirkpatrick
2;1;4771;46;The laws of the abyss – do these break down?;kirkpatrick
2;1;4772;47;Are counsels newly changed in Heaven’s height;kirkpatrick
2;1;4773;48;so you, the damned, approach my secret hills?’;kirkpatrick
2;1;4774;49;My leader took me ﬁrmly in his grip,;kirkpatrick
2;1;4775;50;and – urging me with gestures, hands and words;kirkpatrick
2;1;4776;51;to bend my brow and knee in reverence –;kirkpatrick
2;1;4777;52;‘I do not, of myself, come here,’ he said.;kirkpatrick
2;1;4778;53;‘A lady came from Heaven. And her prayers;kirkpatrick
2;1;4779;54;led me to help this man, and be his guide.;kirkpatrick
2;1;4780;55;But since your will is that the truth be told;kirkpatrick
2;1;4781;56;more fully as to what we are and why,;kirkpatrick
2;1;4782;57;I cannot of my own will say you “nay”.;kirkpatrick
2;1;4783;58;This man has yet to see his ﬁnal night,;kirkpatrick
2;1;4784;59;but through his own stupidity was close,;kirkpatrick
2;1;4785;60;and scarcely had the time in which to turn.;kirkpatrick
2;1;4786;61;Then I was sent, for his sake (as I’ve said),;kirkpatrick
2;1;4787;62;and found no way to see that he survived,;kirkpatrick
2;1;4788;63;save that which I have set myself to take.;kirkpatrick
2;1;4789;64;I have already shown him all the damned,;kirkpatrick
2;1;4790;65;and mean that he should see those spirits now;kirkpatrick
2;1;4791;66;who, in your care, themselves seek purity.;kirkpatrick
2;1;4792;67;Too long to say how I have brought him here.;kirkpatrick
2;1;4793;68;But power comes down and strengthens me in this – to;kirkpatrick
2;1;4794;69;lead him on, to see and hear you speak.;kirkpatrick
2;1;4795;70;Look kindly on his coming, if you will.;kirkpatrick
2;1;4796;71;He goes in search of liberty. All know –;kirkpatrick
2;1;4797;72;who gave their life for that – how dear it is.;kirkpatrick
2;1;4798;73;You know yourself. For, dying in that cause,;kirkpatrick
2;1;4799;74;death had, at Utica, no sting for you.;kirkpatrick
2;1;4800;75;Your mortal robe, on Judgement Day, will shine.;kirkpatrick
2;1;4801;76;Eternal laws are not through us made vain.;kirkpatrick
2;1;4802;77;This man still lives, and Minos binds me not.;kirkpatrick
2;1;4803;78;I’m from that circle where the modest eyes;kirkpatrick
2;1;4804;79;of Marcia, your wife, are seen. Eyes turned,;kirkpatrick
2;1;4805;80;she prays, O sacred breast, you keep her still your own.;kirkpatrick
2;1;4806;81;For love of her, incline to our entreaties.;kirkpatrick
2;1;4807;82;So let us pass through all your seven realms.;kirkpatrick
2;1;4808;83;I’ll take your gracious words to Marcia –;kirkpatrick
2;1;4809;84;if you will grant we speak of you down there.’;kirkpatrick
2;1;4810;85;‘Once, Marcia,’ he said, ‘so pleased my eyes,;kirkpatrick
2;1;4811;86;while I was there, that I, in gratitude,;kirkpatrick
2;1;4812;87;would do for her whatever she might choose.;kirkpatrick
2;1;4813;88;But now she dwells beyond the evil stream.;kirkpatrick
2;1;4814;89;And therefore, by a law in force since I;kirkpatrick
2;1;4815;90;came out of it, she cannot move me more.;kirkpatrick
2;1;4816;91;Yet if in Heaven there is, as you declare,;kirkpatrick
2;1;4817;92;a lady who commands and moves your deeds,;kirkpatrick
2;1;4818;93;ﬁne words aren’t needed. Ask it in her name.;kirkpatrick
2;1;4819;94;Go, and around this man now bind a belt,;kirkpatrick
2;1;4820;95;formed from a single rush grown straight and smooth,;kirkpatrick
2;1;4821;96;then wash his features clean of ﬁlth and stains.;kirkpatrick
2;1;4822;97;It cannot be that any eye, still clutched;kirkpatrick
2;1;4823;98;by mist and murkiness, should meet the ﬁrst;kirkpatrick
2;1;4824;99;of ministers who’ll come from Paradise.;kirkpatrick
2;1;4825;100;Around this little island, all around;kirkpatrick
2;1;4826;101;its lowest reaches where the breakers beat,;kirkpatrick
2;1;4827;102;are rushes, borne up by the yielding ooze.;kirkpatrick
2;1;4828;103;No other plant that comes to leaf or grows;kirkpatrick
2;1;4829;104;to form a rigid stem could ever thrive.;kirkpatrick
2;1;4830;105;For none of these could bend to take those strokes.;kirkpatrick
2;1;4831;106;Do not return along the way you came.;kirkpatrick
2;1;4832;107;The sun that rises now will show the way;kirkpatrick
2;1;4833;108;to take this mountain at a gentler rate.’;kirkpatrick
2;1;4834;109;So saying, he had gone. Without a word,;kirkpatrick
2;1;4835;110;I rose. And, drawing nearer to my guide,;kirkpatrick
2;1;4836;111;tight by his side, I set my eyes on him.;kirkpatrick
2;1;4837;112;And he began: ‘Follow my steps, dear son.;kirkpatrick
2;1;4838;113;Let’s turn back now. From here the level shore,;kirkpatrick
2;1;4839;114;in reaching to its boundaries, slopes down.’;kirkpatrick
2;1;4840;115;Dawn was defeating now the last hour sung;kirkpatrick
2;1;4841;116;by night, which ﬂed before it. And far away;kirkpatrick
2;1;4842;117;I recognized the tremblings of the sea.;kirkpatrick
2;1;4843;118;Alone, we walked along the open plain,;kirkpatrick
2;1;4844;119;as though, returning to a path we’d lost,;kirkpatrick
2;1;4845;120;our steps, until we came to that, were vain.;kirkpatrick
2;1;4846;121;Then, at a place in shadow where the dew;kirkpatrick
2;1;4847;122;still fought against the sun and, cooled by breeze, had;kirkpatrick
2;1;4848;123;scarcely yet been thinned out into vapour,;kirkpatrick
2;1;4849;124;my master placed the palms of both his hands,;kirkpatrick
2;1;4850;125;spread wide, lightly and gently on the tender grass.;kirkpatrick
2;1;4851;126;And I, aware of what his purpose was,;kirkpatrick
2;1;4852;127;oﬀered my tear-stained cheeks to meet his touch.;kirkpatrick
2;1;4853;128;At which, he made once more entirely clean;kirkpatrick
2;1;4854;129;the colour that the dark of Hell had hidden.;kirkpatrick
2;1;4855;130;We then came out across an empty shore;kirkpatrick
2;1;4856;131;that never saw its waters sailed upon;kirkpatrick
2;1;4857;132;by any man who knew how to return.;kirkpatrick
2;1;4858;133;There, at another’s will, he girded me.;kirkpatrick
2;1;4859;134;And this was marvellous: that, as he chose;kirkpatrick
2;1;4860;135;that simple plant, another like it rose,;kirkpatrick
2;1;4861;136;reborn the instant that he plucked it out.;kirkpatrick
2;2;4862;1;The sun had reached, already, that horizon;kirkpatrick
2;2;4863;2;the arc of whose meridian, at its height,;kirkpatrick
2;2;4864;3;covers Jerusalem as daytime ends.;kirkpatrick
2;2;4865;4;And night, which circles opposite the sun,;kirkpatrick
2;2;4866;5;was rising out of Ganges with the Scales,;kirkpatrick
2;2;4867;6;which leave her hand, once she has overcome.;kirkpatrick
2;2;4868;7;So lovely Aurora’s cheeks, both red and white,;kirkpatrick
2;2;4869;8;were turning, where I was, to sallow rose;kirkpatrick
2;2;4870;9;as dawn grew older in the eastern sky.;kirkpatrick
2;2;4871;10;We went on walking, still beside the sea,;kirkpatrick
2;2;4872;11;as people do when pondering the road.;kirkpatrick
2;2;4873;12;(Their hearts go forward, though their limbs delay.)  But;kirkpatrick
2;2;4874;13;look! As Mars – surprised, when morning breaks,;kirkpatrick
2;2;4875;14;by thickening vapours – glows to burning red,;kirkpatrick
2;2;4876;15;low in the west above its ocean ﬂoor,;kirkpatrick
2;2;4877;16;there now appeared (may I see that once more!);kirkpatrick
2;2;4878;17;a light that came so swift across the sea;kirkpatrick
2;2;4879;18;that nothing else in ﬂight could equal it.;kirkpatrick
2;2;4880;19;And, having brieﬂy drawn my eyes away;kirkpatrick
2;2;4881;20;to ask my leader what this light could be,;kirkpatrick
2;2;4882;21;I saw it now grown greater and more bright.;kirkpatrick
2;2;4883;22;And then, around it, all appeared to me;kirkpatrick
2;2;4884;23;a something of I-did-not-know pure white,;kirkpatrick
2;2;4885;24;and, bit by bit, another under that.;kirkpatrick
2;2;4886;25;As long as these ﬁrst whitenesses seemed wings,;kirkpatrick
2;2;4887;26;my teacher spoke no word. But when he saw;kirkpatrick
2;2;4888;27;and recognized who was this galley man:;kirkpatrick
2;2;4889;28;‘Come now,’ he cried out. ‘Bend your knees to him!;kirkpatrick
2;2;4890;29;Look there! God’s angel! Fold your hands in prayer.;kirkpatrick
2;2;4891;30;Henceforth, you’ll meet this kind of minister.;kirkpatrick
2;2;4892;31;You see he scorns all human instruments.;kirkpatrick
2;2;4893;32;He needs no oar, nor any other sail;kirkpatrick
2;2;4894;33;than his own wings, to ply these distant shores.;kirkpatrick
2;2;4895;34;You see he holds these upright to the skies;kirkpatrick
2;2;4896;35;and, with eternal pinions, fans the air.;kirkpatrick
2;2;4897;36;These do not shift as human tresses do.’;kirkpatrick
2;2;4898;37;Then, as he came towards us more and more,;kirkpatrick
2;2;4899;38;that holy bird, he seemed the brighter still.;kirkpatrick
2;2;4900;39;My eyes could not, close to, sustain the sight.;kirkpatrick
2;2;4901;40;I bent my eyes. He reached the shore – his boat;kirkpatrick
2;2;4902;41;so swift, so quick, so light, so elegant,;kirkpatrick
2;2;4903;42;no wave could swallow any part of it.;kirkpatrick
2;2;4904;43;Celestial, at the stern, the pilot stood –;kirkpatrick
2;2;4905;44;beatitude, it seemed, inscribed on him –;kirkpatrick
2;2;4906;45;and, ranged within, a hundred spirits more.;kirkpatrick
2;2;4907;46;‘In exitu Israel de Aegypto’ :;kirkpatrick
2;2;4908;47;they sang this all together, in one voice,;kirkpatrick
2;2;4909;48;with all the psalm that’s written after this.;kirkpatrick
2;2;4910;49;Then, over them, he made the holy cross,;kirkpatrick
2;2;4911;50;at which they ﬂung themselves upon the shore.;kirkpatrick
2;2;4912;51;And he, as fast as he had come, went oﬀ.;kirkpatrick
2;2;4913;52;The crowd that now remained, it seemed, was strange,;kirkpatrick
2;2;4914;53;astray there, wondering, looking all around,;kirkpatrick
2;2;4915;54;as people do, assessing what is new.;kirkpatrick
2;2;4916;55;On every side the sun shot daylight darts.;kirkpatrick
2;2;4917;56;Its well-aimed arrows had already chased;kirkpatrick
2;2;4918;57;the stars of Capricorn from middle sky,;kirkpatrick
2;2;4919;58;by which time these new people raised their brows,;kirkpatrick
2;2;4920;59;saying to us: ‘If you two know this place,;kirkpatrick
2;2;4921;60;point us the way to go towards the Mount.’;kirkpatrick
2;2;4922;61;And Virgil answered: ‘You may think that we;kirkpatrick
2;2;4923;62;possess experience of where we are.;kirkpatrick
2;2;4924;63;But we, like you, are pilgrim foreigners.;kirkpatrick
2;2;4925;64;We came a little while before yourselves,;kirkpatrick
2;2;4926;65;taking a diﬀerent, hard and bitter road.;kirkpatrick
2;2;4927;66;So now the climb will seem to us a game.’;kirkpatrick
2;2;4928;67;The souls who were aware (because I breathed);kirkpatrick
2;2;4929;68;that I was still alive, now blenched in awe,;kirkpatrick
2;2;4930;69;and, wondering at the sight, grew very pale.;kirkpatrick
2;2;4931;70;And, as around some messenger who bears;kirkpatrick
2;2;4932;71;an olive branch in hand, crowds form to hear;kirkpatrick
2;2;4933;72;the news – none shy to trample to the fore –;kirkpatrick
2;2;4934;73;so these souls, too, stares ﬁxed upon my face,;kirkpatrick
2;2;4935;74;forgetting almost (all so fortunate!);kirkpatrick
2;2;4936;75;to go ahead and make themselves more ﬁne.;kirkpatrick
2;2;4937;76;And one drew forward now, I saw, to me;kirkpatrick
2;2;4938;77;to take me in his arms with such great warmth;kirkpatrick
2;2;4939;78;it moved me, so I did the same to him.;kirkpatrick
2;2;4940;79;Ah shadows, empty save in how they look!;kirkpatrick
2;2;4941;80;Three times I locked my hands behind his back.;kirkpatrick
2;2;4942;81;As many times I came back to my breast.;kirkpatrick
2;2;4943;82;Wonder, I think, was painted over me.;kirkpatrick
2;2;4944;83;At which the shadow smiled, and so drew back,;kirkpatrick
2;2;4945;84;while I, pursuing him, pressed further on.;kirkpatrick
2;2;4946;85;Gently, he told me I had better stop.;kirkpatrick
2;2;4947;86;And then I knew who this was, so I prayed;kirkpatrick
2;2;4948;87;that he should speak and pause there for a while.;kirkpatrick
2;2;4949;88;His answer came: ‘As ﬁrst in mortal ﬂesh;kirkpatrick
2;2;4950;89;I loved you well, so, freed, I love you now.;kirkpatrick
2;2;4951;90;And so I stop. But you, why go through here?’;kirkpatrick
2;2;4952;91;‘Casella!’ I said. ‘My own! I take this course;kirkpatrick
2;2;4953;92;to come once more where I have now arrived.;kirkpatrick
2;2;4954;93;But how have you been robbed of so much time?’;kirkpatrick
2;2;4955;94;‘No one has done me violence,’ he said,;kirkpatrick
2;2;4956;95;‘if many times my voyage was denied;kirkpatrick
2;2;4957;96;by Him Who chooses who’ll He take, and when.;kirkpatrick
2;2;4958;97;For His will stands at one with God’s just will.;kirkpatrick
2;2;4959;98;Yet truly for the last three months He’s picked, in utter;kirkpatrick
2;2;4960;99;peace, whoever’s wished to board.;kirkpatrick
2;2;4961;100;So I, who now had gone back to that shore;kirkpatrick
2;2;4962;101;where Tiber waters turn themselves to salt,;kirkpatrick
2;2;4963;102;was, in all kindness, taken up by him.;kirkpatrick
2;2;4964;103;He’s set His wings back now towards that gorge,;kirkpatrick
2;2;4965;104;since all who don’t descend to Acheron;kirkpatrick
2;2;4966;105;will always gather at that river mouth.’;kirkpatrick
2;2;4967;106;And I: ‘If no new law has robbed you of;kirkpatrick
2;2;4968;107;your memory or skill in songs of love –;kirkpatrick
2;2;4969;108;with which you once would calm all my desires –;kirkpatrick
2;2;4970;109;then, if you’d care to, ease my soul a while.;kirkpatrick
2;2;4971;110;For coming here with still its body’s shape,;kirkpatrick
2;2;4972;111;it is so worn, and weary of the way.’;kirkpatrick
2;2;4973;112;‘Love that speaks reasons in my mind to me…’;kirkpatrick
2;2;4974;113;So he began, and in a tone so sweet;kirkpatrick
2;2;4975;114;the sweetness, even now, sounds in my heart.;kirkpatrick
2;2;4976;115;My teacher, I myself and those who’d come;kirkpatrick
2;2;4977;116;along with him, were so content with this;kirkpatrick
2;2;4978;117;that nothing touched the mind apart from that.;kirkpatrick
2;2;4979;118;So there we were, attentive to these notes,;kirkpatrick
2;2;4980;119;entirely still, then calling suddenly,;kirkpatrick
2;2;4981;120;that stern old man: ‘What’s this, malingering souls?;kirkpatrick
2;2;4982;121;What’s this neglect, this simply-standing-here?;kirkpatrick
2;2;4983;122;Go run towards the mountain. Shed that skin;kirkpatrick
2;2;4984;123;which won’t let God be manifest to you.’;kirkpatrick
2;2;4985;124;Compare: when doves, when gleaning grain or weeds,;kirkpatrick
2;2;4986;125;ﬂock all together at their feeding place,;kirkpatrick
2;2;4987;126;with none of their habitual pride, at peace,;kirkpatrick
2;2;4988;127;if something they are fearful of appears,;kirkpatrick
2;2;4989;128;then suddenly they’ll leave that bait behind,;kirkpatrick
2;2;4990;129;assailed by greater worries as they are.;kirkpatrick
2;2;4991;130;In that same way, I saw that fresh new band;kirkpatrick
2;2;4992;131;break oﬀ their song and ﬂee towards the cliﬀ, as people;kirkpatrick
2;2;4993;132;do, not knowing where they’ll end.;kirkpatrick
2;2;4994;133;Our own departure wasn’t much less swift.;kirkpatrick
2;3;4995;1;Although the suddenness with which they ﬂed;kirkpatrick
2;3;4996;2;dispersed the rest across the open plain,;kirkpatrick
2;3;4997;3;turning towards the Mount, where justice probes,;kirkpatrick
2;3;4998;4;I drew the closer to my trusted friend.;kirkpatrick
2;3;4999;5;For how, without him, could I run ahead?;kirkpatrick
2;3;5000;6;And who but he could draw me up that hill?;kirkpatrick
2;3;5001;7;But he, it seemed, was gnawed by self-reproach.;kirkpatrick
2;3;5002;8;Such dignity of conscience, clear and clean,;kirkpatrick
2;3;5003;9;bitten so keenly by so slight a fault!;kirkpatrick
2;3;5004;10;When once his steps had put aside that haste;kirkpatrick
2;3;5005;11;that strips the air of honour from our deeds,;kirkpatrick
2;3;5006;12;my mind, till now tight-reined within itself,;kirkpatrick
2;3;5007;13;in eagerness of purpose broadened out.;kirkpatrick
2;3;5008;14;I gave my sight to meet the rising ground,;kirkpatrick
2;3;5009;15;higher than all, that banks towards the skies.;kirkpatrick
2;3;5010;16;The sun that ﬂared behind us, brilliant red,;kirkpatrick
2;3;5011;17;broke now in front of me – my silhouette! –;kirkpatrick
2;3;5012;18;as rays of light lay resting on my form.;kirkpatrick
2;3;5013;19;I turned around, to one side, fearing I;kirkpatrick
2;3;5014;20;had been abandoned there, seeing ahead;kirkpatrick
2;3;5015;21;of me alone the earth was dark with shade.;kirkpatrick
2;3;5016;22;And he, my strength, swung straight around to say:;kirkpatrick
2;3;5017;23;‘Why so dismayed and faithless? Don’t you know;kirkpatrick
2;3;5018;24;that I am with you and still guide your steps?;kirkpatrick
2;3;5019;25;The evening falls where now, within its grave;kirkpatrick
2;3;5020;26;that body lies in which I cast a shade,;kirkpatrick
2;3;5021;27;Napoli has it, borne from Brindisi.;kirkpatrick
2;3;5022;28;If nothing now is shadowed at my feet,;kirkpatrick
2;3;5023;29;don’t wonder any more than when the rays;kirkpatrick
2;3;5024;30;the heavens project don’t block each other out.;kirkpatrick
2;3;5025;31;To suﬀer torments both of heat and chill,;kirkpatrick
2;3;5026;32;the Utmost Power gives bodies, ﬁt for that,;kirkpatrick
2;3;5027;33;not wishing how it does to be revealed.;kirkpatrick
2;3;5028;34;It’s madness if we hope that rational minds;kirkpatrick
2;3;5029;35;should ever follow to its end the road;kirkpatrick
2;3;5030;36;that one true being in three persons takes.;kirkpatrick
2;3;5031;37;Content yourselves with quia , human kind.;kirkpatrick
2;3;5032;38;Had you been able to see everything,;kirkpatrick
2;3;5033;39;Mary need not have laboured to give birth.;kirkpatrick
2;3;5034;40;You saw the fruitless yearning of those men;kirkpatrick
2;3;5035;41;who might have had that yearning satisﬁed,;kirkpatrick
2;3;5036;42;now given them eternally to mourn.;kirkpatrick
2;3;5037;43;Plato, I mean, and Aristotle, too,;kirkpatrick
2;3;5038;44;and many more with them.’ He bowed his head;kirkpatrick
2;3;5039;45;and said no more, remaining darkly troubled.;kirkpatrick
2;3;5040;46;We had, meanwhile, now reached the mountain foot.;kirkpatrick
2;3;5041;47;And there we came across a cliﬀ so sheer;kirkpatrick
2;3;5042;48;that legs, though willing, were quite useless there.;kirkpatrick
2;3;5043;49;Between Fort Lerici and Turbia;kirkpatrick
2;3;5044;50;the wildest, steepest scarp would be, compared;kirkpatrick
2;3;5045;51;with this, an easy stairway, opening clear.;kirkpatrick
2;3;5046;52;‘Now who’s to know on which side this cliﬀ sinks’ –;kirkpatrick
2;3;5047;53;so stopping in his tracks my teacher said –;kirkpatrick
2;3;5048;54;‘to let us climb, since we have got no wings?’;kirkpatrick
2;3;5049;55;And while he went along, his head bent low,;kirkpatrick
2;3;5050;56;examining in thought the journey’s scheme,;kirkpatrick
2;3;5051;57;and I, in wonder, gazed around the rock,;kirkpatrick
2;3;5052;58;a tribe of souls appeared, towards our left,;kirkpatrick
2;3;5053;59;moving in our direction (though their tread came slow and;kirkpatrick
2;3;5054;60;so it hardly seemed to us they did).;kirkpatrick
2;3;5055;61;‘Lift up your eyes! Look, sir,’ I said to him.;kirkpatrick
2;3;5056;62;‘There, over there, are some who’ll give advice,;kirkpatrick
2;3;5057;63;if you yourself have nothing to suggest.’;kirkpatrick
2;3;5058;64;He looked across, his face now free from doubt,;kirkpatrick
2;3;5059;65;and answered: ‘Let’s go there. They come so slow.;kirkpatrick
2;3;5060;66;And you, dear son, be conﬁdent, take heart.’;kirkpatrick
2;3;5061;67;Those people, when we’d gone a thousand steps,;kirkpatrick
2;3;5062;68;were still, I’d say, as far away from us;kirkpatrick
2;3;5063;69;as someone with a sling might reach by hand,;kirkpatrick
2;3;5064;70;when, one and all, they clung to that hard mass;kirkpatrick
2;3;5065;71;of towering rock, and stood there ﬁrm and tight,;kirkpatrick
2;3;5066;72;as travellers, uncertain, glance about.;kirkpatrick
2;3;5067;73;‘You chosen ones, who met your end so well,;kirkpatrick
2;3;5068;74;I ask you,’ Virgil started, ‘by that peace;kirkpatrick
2;3;5069;75;which, as I think, is waiting for you all,;kirkpatrick
2;3;5070;76;please tell us where the mountain angles down;kirkpatrick
2;3;5071;77;to make it possible for us to climb.;kirkpatrick
2;3;5072;78;For those who know the most, most hate time lost.’;kirkpatrick
2;3;5073;79;As silly sheep come edging from their fold,;kirkpatrick
2;3;5074;80;one, two and three, the rest all standing there;kirkpatrick
2;3;5075;81;timidly turning earthwards eyes and snouts,;kirkpatrick
2;3;5076;82;to do exactly what the ﬁrst one does,;kirkpatrick
2;3;5077;83;huddling against her if she hesitates,;kirkpatrick
2;3;5078;84;quiet and meek, not knowing why they do,;kirkpatrick
2;3;5079;85;so, too, I now saw moving out to me;kirkpatrick
2;3;5080;86;the forward markers of that happy ﬂock,;kirkpatrick
2;3;5081;87;modest in look and digniﬁed in walk.;kirkpatrick
2;3;5082;88;When those towards the front saw shattered light;kirkpatrick
2;3;5083;89;falling at my right hand towards the ground;kirkpatrick
2;3;5084;90;(so that, from me, the shadow reached the cliﬀ),;kirkpatrick
2;3;5085;91;they stopped and drew themselves a little back.;kirkpatrick
2;3;5086;92;Likewise the rest that followed on from them.;kirkpatrick
2;3;5087;93;Not knowing why, they did the very same.;kirkpatrick
2;3;5088;94;‘You need not ask. I freely will confess;kirkpatrick
2;3;5089;95;that what you see are truly human limbs.;kirkpatrick
2;3;5090;96;That’s why the sunlight on the earth is split.;kirkpatrick
2;3;5091;97;Don’t wonder at the sight but just believe;kirkpatrick
2;3;5092;98;that, not without some virtue from the skies,;kirkpatrick
2;3;5093;99;does he attempt to overcome this wall.’;kirkpatrick
2;3;5094;100;So said my teacher. And these honoured folk;kirkpatrick
2;3;5095;101;replied: ‘Turn back! Go on ahead of us’,;kirkpatrick
2;3;5096;102;and signalled this to us with hands reversed.;kirkpatrick
2;3;5097;103;And one of them began: ‘Whoever you,;kirkpatrick
2;3;5098;104;thus going on your way, may be, turn round;kirkpatrick
2;3;5099;105;and say if you have ever seen me there.’;kirkpatrick
2;3;5100;106;I turned to him and ﬁxed him with my gaze.;kirkpatrick
2;3;5101;107;Fair-haired and handsome, with a noble look,;kirkpatrick
2;3;5102;108;a sword stroke, though, had cut across his brow.;kirkpatrick
2;3;5103;109;In all humility, I then denied;kirkpatrick
2;3;5104;110;that I, till then, had seen him. ‘Look!’ he said,;kirkpatrick
2;3;5105;111;and pointed out a wound high on his chest.’;kirkpatrick
2;3;5106;112;Then, smiling: ‘I am Manfred,’ he declared,;kirkpatrick
2;3;5107;113;‘grandson to Constance, holy empress.;kirkpatrick
2;3;5108;114;I pray you, therefore, when you’ve once returned,;kirkpatrick
2;3;5109;115;seek out my lovely daughter, who has borne;kirkpatrick
2;3;5110;116;the honoured crowns of Sicily and Aragon.;kirkpatrick
2;3;5111;117;Tell her the truth, whatever else is said:;kirkpatrick
2;3;5112;118;I, broken in my person, had received;kirkpatrick
2;3;5113;119;two mortal wounds and, weeping, gave myself;kirkpatrick
2;3;5114;120;to Him who, freely, cares to pardon us.;kirkpatrick
2;3;5115;121;My sins and crimes were horrible to hear.;kirkpatrick
2;3;5116;122;God, though, unendingly is good. His arms;kirkpatrick
2;3;5117;123;enfold and grasp all those who turn to Him.;kirkpatrick
2;3;5118;124;And if Cosenza’s pastor, who was sent;kirkpatrick
2;3;5119;125;to hunt me down by Clement (then our pope),;kirkpatrick
2;3;5120;126;had read aright the face God turned to mine,;kirkpatrick
2;3;5121;127;my body’s bones would still be where they were,;kirkpatrick
2;3;5122;128;near Benevento where the bridge head falls,;kirkpatrick
2;3;5123;129;guarded by that great cairn of heavy stones.;kirkpatrick
2;3;5124;130;The rain now bathes them, and they’re moved by wind,;kirkpatrick
2;3;5125;131;beyond the Kingdom down the Green Stream’s bank;kirkpatrick
2;3;5126;132;to which he’d carried them with torches dimmed.;kirkpatrick
2;3;5127;133;No one, while hope shows any hint of green,;kirkpatrick
2;3;5128;134;is lost beyond return to love eternal;kirkpatrick
2;3;5129;135;merely because the Church has voiced its curse.;kirkpatrick
2;3;5130;136;It is, however, true that those who die,;kirkpatrick
2;3;5131;137;although repentant, in contempt of Church,;kirkpatrick
2;3;5132;138;are bound to stay outside this mountain wall;kirkpatrick
2;3;5133;139;some thirty times the span of years that they;kirkpatrick
2;3;5134;140;presumed to stand apart – if this decree;kirkpatrick
2;3;5135;141;is not made shorter by good works of prayer.;kirkpatrick
2;3;5136;142;Now see if you can bring me happiness,;kirkpatrick
2;3;5137;143;revealing to my Constance that you’ve seen;kirkpatrick
2;3;5138;144;where I am now, and understood this ban.;kirkpatrick
2;3;5139;145;For here we greatly gain from those down there.’;kirkpatrick
2;4;5140;1;When, through enjoyment (or indeed through pain);kirkpatrick
2;4;5141;2;which takes possession of some inner strength,;kirkpatrick
2;4;5142;3;the soul is gathered up round that alone,;kirkpatrick
2;4;5143;4;it can’t, it seems, pay heed to other powers.;kirkpatrick
2;4;5144;5;And this refutes the error that maintains;kirkpatrick
2;4;5145;6;the soul ignites in us in multiples.;kirkpatrick
2;4;5146;7;When something, therefore, that is heard or seen;kirkpatrick
2;4;5147;8;holds in its thrall the lower act of soul,;kirkpatrick
2;4;5148;9;time passes by, and we don’t notice it.;kirkpatrick
2;4;5149;10;For these are diﬀerent powers – the one that hears,;kirkpatrick
2;4;5150;11;the one residing in the total soul –;kirkpatrick
2;4;5151;12;the ﬁrst (let’s say) is bound, the other free.;kirkpatrick
2;4;5152;13;I had my own experience of this,;kirkpatrick
2;4;5153;14;hearing that spirit, marvelling at his words.;kirkpatrick
2;4;5154;15;For now the sun, although I had not seen,;kirkpatrick
2;4;5155;16;had risen fully ﬁve-times-ten degrees when;kirkpatrick
2;4;5156;17;we arrived where all these souls, as one,;kirkpatrick
2;4;5157;18;cried out to us: ‘It’s here, what you demand.’;kirkpatrick
2;4;5158;19;A farmer, when the grapes are growing dark,;kirkpatrick
2;4;5159;20;with one scant forkful of his hedging thorn;kirkpatrick
2;4;5160;21;will often stuﬀ a wider gap than this,;kirkpatrick
2;4;5161;22;that corridor through which my lord and guide;kirkpatrick
2;4;5162;23;now climbed – I following behind, alone;kirkpatrick
2;4;5163;24;since all the company, by now, had gone.;kirkpatrick
2;4;5164;25;San Leo you can scale, edge down to Noli,;kirkpatrick
2;4;5165;26;climb to Bismantova, ascend Cacume.;kirkpatrick
2;4;5166;27;Feet serve you there. But here you need to ﬂy –  with;kirkpatrick
2;4;5167;28;quickening wings, I mean, and pinions;kirkpatrick
2;4;5168;29;of great desire, behind that leading-on;kirkpatrick
2;4;5169;30;that oﬀers me all hope and gives me light.;kirkpatrick
2;4;5170;31;We scrambled through the bore of shattered rock.;kirkpatrick
2;4;5171;32;On every side its edges tightened round.;kirkpatrick
2;4;5172;33;The ground beneath us called for feet and hands.;kirkpatrick
2;4;5173;34;And when we’d reached the rim above that cliﬀ,;kirkpatrick
2;4;5174;35;and came to where the slope was opening out,;kirkpatrick
2;4;5175;36;‘What path, sir,’ I inquired, ‘shall we take now?’;kirkpatrick
2;4;5176;37;And he to me: ‘Don’t let your footsteps slide.;kirkpatrick
2;4;5177;38;Just follow me. We’ll gain ground on this mount until some;kirkpatrick
2;4;5178;39;escort comes who knows the way.’;kirkpatrick
2;4;5179;40;The summit was so high it conquered sight.;kirkpatrick
2;4;5180;41;The slope stood proud, its incline far more steep than;kirkpatrick
2;4;5181;42;(point to centre) forty-ﬁve degrees.;kirkpatrick
2;4;5182;43;I was all in, and so began to say:;kirkpatrick
2;4;5183;44;‘Look round, my dearest father. Turn and see,;kirkpatrick
2;4;5184;45;if you don’t stop, I’m stuck here all alone.’;kirkpatrick
2;4;5185;46;And he said: ‘Son, just drag yourself up there,’;kirkpatrick
2;4;5186;47;his ﬁnger pointing to a ledge beyond;kirkpatrick
2;4;5187;48;that ran around the ﬂank of that sheer slope.;kirkpatrick
2;4;5188;49;His words so stirred me to renewed attempts,;kirkpatrick
2;4;5189;50;I forced myself to track him, hands and knees,;kirkpatrick
2;4;5190;51;till that encirclement was at my feet.;kirkpatrick
2;4;5191;52;And there we came and sat, the two of us,;kirkpatrick
2;4;5192;53;turned to the east where we had made our climb;kirkpatrick
2;4;5193;54;(for looking back will often cheer you up).;kirkpatrick
2;4;5194;55;I set my eyes on, ﬁrst, the shores below,;kirkpatrick
2;4;5195;56;then raised them to the sun, and was amazed;kirkpatrick
2;4;5196;57;to see its light assail us from the left.;kirkpatrick
2;4;5197;58;The poet noticed that I stood struck dumb;kirkpatrick
2;4;5198;59;so stupeﬁed to see light’s chariot;kirkpatrick
2;4;5199;60;process between us and the Aquilon.;kirkpatrick
2;4;5200;61;‘If Castor,’ he replied, ‘and Pollux were;kirkpatrick
2;4;5201;62;now standing in conjunction with the glass;kirkpatrick
2;4;5202;63;that draws its mirror light both north and south,  you;kirkpatrick
2;4;5203;64;then would see the rose-red Zodiac;kirkpatrick
2;4;5204;65;wheel still more tightly round the Ursa stars – so long as;kirkpatrick
2;4;5205;66;it’s not left its former track.;kirkpatrick
2;4;5206;67;And if you need to get your mind round that,;kirkpatrick
2;4;5207;68;imagine Zion – harvest that within –;kirkpatrick
2;4;5208;69;and how that mountain stands upon the globe,;kirkpatrick
2;4;5209;70;so that, though set in diﬀerent hemispheres,;kirkpatrick
2;4;5210;71;the same horizon bounds that Mount and this.;kirkpatrick
2;4;5211;72;From which you’ll see (if you think clearly now)  the;kirkpatrick
2;4;5212;73;road where Phaeton had no skill to drive;kirkpatrick
2;4;5213;74;was bound to travel north of that mid-line,;kirkpatrick
2;4;5214;75;and south, conversely, of Jerusalem.’;kirkpatrick
2;4;5215;76;‘Oh, sir!’ I said. ‘With such great certitude;kirkpatrick
2;4;5216;77;I’ve never seen as clearly as I do,;kirkpatrick
2;4;5217;78;(I’d not intelligence enough for that);kirkpatrick
2;4;5218;79;how that mid-circle of supernal force;kirkpatrick
2;4;5219;80;(in certain texts termed “Equatorial”;kirkpatrick
2;4;5220;81;which always stands between the sun and chill,;kirkpatrick
2;4;5221;82;veers, for the reason that you gave, as far;kirkpatrick
2;4;5222;83;towards the northern clime of seven stars;kirkpatrick
2;4;5223;84;as Hebrews see it bend to warmer parts.;kirkpatrick
2;4;5224;85;But, if you please, I’d really like to know;kirkpatrick
2;4;5225;86;how far we’ve yet to travel. This slope climbs;kirkpatrick
2;4;5226;87;higher by far than eyes of mine can go.’;kirkpatrick
2;4;5227;88;And he: ‘This mountain is by nature such;kirkpatrick
2;4;5228;89;that, down below, the start is always hard,;kirkpatrick
2;4;5229;90;yet hurts far less the more one rises up.;kirkpatrick
2;4;5230;91;And so when you will ﬁnd the going smooth,;kirkpatrick
2;4;5231;92;ﬂoating as lightly upwards in ascent;kirkpatrick
2;4;5232;93;as boats that travel down a ﬂowing stream,;kirkpatrick
2;4;5233;94;you’ll then have reached the end of this rough path.;kirkpatrick
2;4;5234;95;Await that point to rest your weariness.;kirkpatrick
2;4;5235;96;I’ll say no more. I know the truth of this.’;kirkpatrick
2;4;5236;97;The moment he had ﬁnished speaking so,;kirkpatrick
2;4;5237;98;a voice rang out close by us: ‘Well, perhaps;kirkpatrick
2;4;5238;99;you’ll need a good sit-down before you do.’;kirkpatrick
2;4;5239;100;On hearing this, we both of us turned round,;kirkpatrick
2;4;5240;101;and saw, towards our left, a bulky rock;kirkpatrick
2;4;5241;102;of which, at ﬁrst, we’d neither been aware.;kirkpatrick
2;4;5242;103;We drew ourselves across. Some persons there;kirkpatrick
2;4;5243;104;were sitting in the shadow of that stone,;kirkpatrick
2;4;5244;105;in postures, one might say, of negligence.;kirkpatrick
2;4;5245;106;And one of those, who seemed to me worn out,;kirkpatrick
2;4;5246;107;was sitting with his arms around his knees,;kirkpatrick
2;4;5247;108;holding his face bowed heavily between.;kirkpatrick
2;4;5248;109;‘My dearest lord,’ I said, ‘just look at him –;kirkpatrick
2;4;5249;110;at that one there who seems more negligent;kirkpatrick
2;4;5250;111;than if his sister were Pure Indolence.’;kirkpatrick
2;4;5251;112;At this he turned a bit, to pay us heed,;kirkpatrick
2;4;5252;113;moving his cheek to look along his thigh.;kirkpatrick
2;4;5253;114;‘All right,’ he said. ‘Head up, you big, strong lad!’;kirkpatrick
2;4;5254;115;I knew then who he was. And all the aches;kirkpatrick
2;4;5255;116;that made my breath still come a little fast;kirkpatrick
2;4;5256;117;could not prevent me from approaching him.;kirkpatrick
2;4;5257;118;I reached him and he hardly raised his head,;kirkpatrick
2;4;5258;119;saying: ‘You’ve seen now, have you, how the sun leads to;kirkpatrick
2;4;5259;120;the left its chariot at your back?’;kirkpatrick
2;4;5260;121;His curt expressions and his sluggish turns;kirkpatrick
2;4;5261;122;had moved my lips, a little, to a smile.;kirkpatrick
2;4;5262;123;‘Belacqua,’ I began, ‘I need not now;kirkpatrick
2;4;5263;124;grieve for you any longer. But say why;kirkpatrick
2;4;5264;125;you’re sat down here. You’re waiting for a guide?;kirkpatrick
2;4;5265;126;Or are you back again to your old ways?’;kirkpatrick
2;4;5266;127;‘Brother’ he said, ‘what point in going up?’;kirkpatrick
2;4;5267;128;God’s angel, sitting at the gate up there,;kirkpatrick
2;4;5268;129;would not admit me to the Penances.;kirkpatrick
2;4;5269;130;The heavens must circle ﬁrst around me here;kirkpatrick
2;4;5270;131;the length of time they did around my life;kirkpatrick
2;4;5271;132;(since I delayed good sighs until my end);kirkpatrick
2;4;5272;133;unless, before that, prayer has brought me aid,;kirkpatrick
2;4;5273;134;rising on high from hearts that live in grace.;kirkpatrick
2;4;5274;135;What else – since Heaven won’t hear – is any use?’;kirkpatrick
2;4;5275;136;The poet now was climbing further on,;kirkpatrick
2;4;5276;137;saying: ‘Come! Come! The high meridian – look! – is;kirkpatrick
2;4;5277;138;touched by sun. Along the western shore,;kirkpatrick
2;4;5278;139;the foot of night is falling on Maroc.’;kirkpatrick
2;5;5279;1;Already some way past the shadow folk,;kirkpatrick
2;5;5280;2;I climbed still onward in my leader’s track,;kirkpatrick
2;5;5281;3;until, below us, one of them burst out:;kirkpatrick
2;5;5282;4;‘See that?’ – a ﬁnger pointing long – ‘The one behind!;kirkpatrick
2;5;5283;5;No sun ray shines, it seems, towards his left!;kirkpatrick
2;5;5284;6;And doesn’t he behave as though alive?’;kirkpatrick
2;5;5285;7;On hearing these sharp words, I turned my eyes,;kirkpatrick
2;5;5286;8;and saw them gazing in astonishment,;kirkpatrick
2;5;5287;9;at me – yes, me! – and the broken sunlight.;kirkpatrick
2;5;5288;10;‘Why let your thoughts get tangled up like that?’;kirkpatrick
2;5;5289;11;(My master speaks.) ‘It only slows your stride.;kirkpatrick
2;5;5290;12;And why be bothered by their whisperings?;kirkpatrick
2;5;5291;13;Keep close behind me. Let them say their say.;kirkpatrick
2;5;5292;14;Stand straight, a mighty tower unwavering,;kirkpatrick
2;5;5293;15;its height unshaken by such breaths of wind.;kirkpatrick
2;5;5294;16;When thought is bred too rampantly from thought,;kirkpatrick
2;5;5295;17;then, of himself, a man will miss his mark.;kirkpatrick
2;5;5296;18;Each mental thrust debilitates the ﬁrst.’;kirkpatrick
2;5;5297;19;What answer could I oﬀer, save ‘I come’?;kirkpatrick
2;5;5298;20;I said so, sprinkled by that blushing hue;kirkpatrick
2;5;5299;21;that, on occasion, means we merit pardon.;kirkpatrick
2;5;5300;22;Meanwhile, across the angle of our climb,;kirkpatrick
2;5;5301;23;there now appeared ahead another group,;kirkpatrick
2;5;5302;24;intoning, verse by verse, the ‘Miserere’ .;kirkpatrick
2;5;5303;25;But when they saw my limbs would not allow;kirkpatrick
2;5;5304;26;a thoroughfare to any ray of light,;kirkpatrick
2;5;5305;27;they changed their chanting to a long, hoarse ‘Oooh!’;kirkpatrick
2;5;5306;28;Then two, who acted as their nuncios,;kirkpatrick
2;5;5307;29;hurried to meet us with the urgent plea:;kirkpatrick
2;5;5308;30;‘What is your standing here? Please let us know.’;kirkpatrick
2;5;5309;31;My master answered: ‘You may now return;kirkpatrick
2;5;5310;32;and bear to those who sent you this reply:;kirkpatrick
2;5;5311;33;“This man, in body, is true ﬂesh and bone.”;kirkpatrick
2;5;5312;34;And if, as I suppose they did, they stopped;kirkpatrick
2;5;5313;35;because they saw that shade, these words should serve.;kirkpatrick
2;5;5314;36;Let them all honour him. He’ll pay them well.’;kirkpatrick
2;5;5315;37;Vapours, when kindled in night’s early hours,;kirkpatrick
2;5;5316;38;ﬂash across tranquil skies like meteors,;kirkpatrick
2;5;5317;39;and August clouds are cleft by setting suns.;kirkpatrick
2;5;5318;40;Yet none I’ve ever seen went up as quick;kirkpatrick
2;5;5319;41;as these two messengers, who turned, once there,;kirkpatrick
2;5;5320;42;with all the rest, to us – a herd in rampage.;kirkpatrick
2;5;5321;43;‘They’ll come in multitudes,’ the poet said,;kirkpatrick
2;5;5322;44;‘and mill around and pester you for prayers.;kirkpatrick
2;5;5323;45;So listen as you go, but still press on.’;kirkpatrick
2;5;5324;46;‘You there, that soul now set for happiness’;kirkpatrick
2;5;5325;47;(they yelled their greeting) ‘with your limbs intact as ever;kirkpatrick
2;5;5326;48;you were born! Slow down a bit!;kirkpatrick
2;5;5327;49;Look! Is there anyone you’ve seen before?;kirkpatrick
2;5;5328;50;You might, if so, bear news of them beyond.;kirkpatrick
2;5;5329;51;Ah! Where to now? Ah! Why don’t you stand still?;kirkpatrick
2;5;5330;52;We all were victims of some violent death,;kirkpatrick
2;5;5331;53;yet sinners till we reached our ﬁnal hour.;kirkpatrick
2;5;5332;54;Then Heaven’s light dawned and made us see things;kirkpatrick
2;5;5333;55;clear,  so that, repenting and forgiving all,;kirkpatrick
2;5;5334;56;we came from life remade at peace with God,;kirkpatrick
2;5;5335;57;who heartens our desire to see Him still.’;kirkpatrick
2;5;5336;58;‘I stare into your eyes,’ I answered them,;kirkpatrick
2;5;5337;59;‘and recognize no single one. Yet you;kirkpatrick
2;5;5338;60;are spirits born anew to good. And all;kirkpatrick
2;5;5339;61;you wish – and I can do – I shall. Please say.;kirkpatrick
2;5;5340;62;I swear this by the peace that leads me on;kirkpatrick
2;5;5341;63;from world to world, pursuing this great guide.’;kirkpatrick
2;5;5342;64;Then one began: ‘You need not swear to that.;kirkpatrick
2;5;5343;65;Granted your will is not cut short by “can’t”,;kirkpatrick
2;5;5344;66;each of us trusts that you will bring some good.;kirkpatrick
2;5;5345;67;May I (who’ll only speak till others do);kirkpatrick
2;5;5346;68;entreat you, if you’ve seen those lands that lie;kirkpatrick
2;5;5347;69;between Romagna and the realm of Charles,;kirkpatrick
2;5;5348;70;that you, in all your kindness, pray for me;kirkpatrick
2;5;5349;71;in Fano – so entreaties oﬀered there;kirkpatrick
2;5;5350;72;may give me strength to cleanse my grievous sins.;kirkpatrick
2;5;5351;73;I was from Fano. But the hollow wounds;kirkpatrick
2;5;5352;74;from which the blood by which I lived ran down,;kirkpatrick
2;5;5353;75;were dealt me by the Antenorians.;kirkpatrick
2;5;5354;76;I thought my safety was, with them, assured.;kirkpatrick
2;5;5355;77;The Estes got it ﬁxed, their spite to me;kirkpatrick
2;5;5356;78;exceeding all that justice could require.;kirkpatrick
2;5;5357;79;If only I had ﬂed towards La Mira;kirkpatrick
2;5;5358;80;– they caught me as I ran to Oriaco –;kirkpatrick
2;5;5359;81;my place would be where men breathe, even now.;kirkpatrick
2;5;5360;82;Towards the marsh I ran, where – brackish reeds;kirkpatrick
2;5;5361;83;entwining me – I fell, watching as, in this mire, a lake;kirkpatrick
2;5;5362;84;spread outwards, forming from my veins.’;kirkpatrick
2;5;5363;85;‘May your desires be met’ (another spoke);kirkpatrick
2;5;5364;86;‘that draw you to the mountain height. Then, please, take;kirkpatrick
2;5;5365;87;pity. In your goodness, aid my own.;kirkpatrick
2;5;5366;88;I am – once Montefeltran – now Buonconte.;kirkpatrick
2;5;5367;89;Giovanna does not pray for me. None cares.;kirkpatrick
2;5;5368;90;And so, among all these, I walk, brow lowered.’;kirkpatrick
2;5;5369;91;‘No one has ever known,’ I said, ‘your place;kirkpatrick
2;5;5370;92;of burial. What led you – chance? or was it force? – away,;kirkpatrick
2;5;5371;93;at Campaldino, from the kill?’;kirkpatrick
2;5;5372;94;‘Ah!’ he replied. ‘A stream – the Archiano – runs;kirkpatrick
2;5;5373;95;across the lower Casentino hills,;kirkpatrick
2;5;5374;96;born above Hermitage-in-Apennine.;kirkpatrick
2;5;5375;97;I’d got to where this river’s title fails,;kirkpatrick
2;5;5376;98;ﬂeeing on foot, and wounded in my throat,;kirkpatrick
2;5;5377;99;a line of blood behind me on the plain.;kirkpatrick
2;5;5378;100;And now I lost my sight. And all my words;kirkpatrick
2;5;5379;101;ended in uttering Maria’s name.;kirkpatrick
2;5;5380;102;I fell – my ﬂesh alone remaining there.;kirkpatrick
2;5;5381;103;But tell the living this – I’ll speak the truth –;kirkpatrick
2;5;5382;104;God’s angel laid his hands on me. Hell shrieked:;kirkpatrick
2;5;5383;105;“Why do you rob me, Heavenspawn, of this?;kirkpatrick
2;5;5384;106;You’d prise him from me for one little tear,;kirkpatrick
2;5;5385;107;and carry oﬀ his everlasting part?;kirkpatrick
2;5;5386;108;Well, I’ll rule otherwise the other half!”;kirkpatrick
2;5;5387;109;Humid evaporations (as you know);kirkpatrick
2;5;5388;110;collect in air, then, rising to the grip;kirkpatrick
2;5;5389;111;of freezing air, return to earth as rain.;kirkpatrick
2;5;5390;112;There now arrived the Evil Urge – who seeks,;kirkpatrick
2;5;5391;113;in mind, for nothing if not ill – and stirred,;kirkpatrick
2;5;5392;114;through powers its nature gives, wind, murk and fog.;kirkpatrick
2;5;5393;115;And when the light of day had been put out,;kirkpatrick
2;5;5394;116;he draped the vale in clouds, from Pratomagno;kirkpatrick
2;5;5395;117;to reach the summit of the mountain range;kirkpatrick
2;5;5396;118;and made the skies condense till gravid air;kirkpatrick
2;5;5397;119;was turned, once more, to water. Whatever;kirkpatrick
2;5;5398;120;earth refused to bear ran oﬀ in runnels.;kirkpatrick
2;5;5399;121;And when these streams in torrents were conjoined,;kirkpatrick
2;5;5400;122;these rushed towards the sovereign river course;kirkpatrick
2;5;5401;123;with such great speed that nothing held them back.;kirkpatrick
2;5;5402;124;The Archiano – furious, in spate – had found;kirkpatrick
2;5;5403;125;my body at its outlet, rigid, chill.;kirkpatrick
2;5;5404;126;It drove this to the Arno, loosing there;kirkpatrick
2;5;5405;127;the cross that, lost in agony, my arms had formed.;kirkpatrick
2;5;5406;128;From bank to riverbed, it swirled me round,;kirkpatrick
2;5;5407;129;then wrapped and hid me in its muddy spoil.’;kirkpatrick
2;5;5408;130;‘When you return, pray Heaven, to the world,;kirkpatrick
2;5;5409;131;and, having rested from long travelling’;kirkpatrick
2;5;5410;132;(with these few words a third soul joined the group);kirkpatrick
2;5;5411;133;‘please, do remember me. I am La Pia.;kirkpatrick
2;5;5412;134;Siena made me, unmade by Maremma.;kirkpatrick
2;5;5413;135;And he knows this who, once I wore his ring,;kirkpatrick
2;5;5414;136;took me in marriage with his own bright gem.’;kirkpatrick
2;6;5415;1;When punters split oﬀ from some gambling game,;kirkpatrick
2;6;5416;2;the loser stays behind, all misery,;kirkpatrick
2;6;5417;3;to check the throws once more and, sadly, learn,;kirkpatrick
2;6;5418;4;while, with the winner, all the rest go oﬀ.;kirkpatrick
2;6;5419;5;Some buttonhole the man, some pluck his tails,;kirkpatrick
2;6;5420;6;and some his sleeve – ‘Just think of me,’ they mean.;kirkpatrick
2;6;5421;7;Though hearing each of them, he does not pause,;kirkpatrick
2;6;5422;8;his hands fend all away, to make them stop.;kirkpatrick
2;6;5423;9;So he defends himself from this great press.;kirkpatrick
2;6;5424;10;Well, that was me, in that dense crowd of souls,;kirkpatrick
2;6;5425;11;turning my face to this side, then to that.;kirkpatrick
2;6;5426;12;By promising each one, I got away.;kirkpatrick
2;6;5427;13;The Aretine was there who met his end;kirkpatrick
2;6;5428;14;at vicious Ghin di Tacco’s scything arm,;kirkpatrick
2;6;5429;15;he, too, who, running with the hunt, had drowned.;kirkpatrick
2;6;5430;16;And here as well, with hands stretched out in prayer,;kirkpatrick
2;6;5431;17;was Frederick Novello and that Pisan man;kirkpatrick
2;6;5432;18;who made the clan Marzucco’s power appear.;kirkpatrick
2;6;5433;19;I saw Count Orso, and the man whose soul;kirkpatrick
2;6;5434;20;was severed from his limbs, so he declared,;kirkpatrick
2;6;5435;21;by spite and envy and no crime of his.;kirkpatrick
2;6;5436;22;I mean Pierre la Brosse – and, while still there,;kirkpatrick
2;6;5437;23;just let the lady of Brabant (lest she;kirkpatrick
2;6;5438;24;be herded with the worst for that) take care.;kirkpatrick
2;6;5439;25;As soon as I got free from all these shades –;kirkpatrick
2;6;5440;26;who went still praying for another’s prayer;kirkpatrick
2;6;5441;27;to speed them on their way to holiness –;kirkpatrick
2;6;5442;28;I thus began: ‘It seems that you, my Light,;kirkpatrick
2;6;5443;29;deny overtly in a certain text;kirkpatrick
2;6;5444;30;that prayers can ever bend what Heaven dictates.;kirkpatrick
2;6;5445;31;And yet these folk are praying just for that.;kirkpatrick
2;6;5446;32;Could it then be the hopes they have are vain?;kirkpatrick
2;6;5447;33;Or is it that your words aren’t clear to me?’;kirkpatrick
2;6;5448;34;And he to me: ‘The words I write are plain.;kirkpatrick
2;6;5449;35;And yet, if you look closely with sane thought,;kirkpatrick
2;6;5450;36;the hope that these all have will never fail.;kirkpatrick
2;6;5451;37;God’s justice at its summit does not sink;kirkpatrick
2;6;5452;38;because, in one sharp point, the ﬁre of love;kirkpatrick
2;6;5453;39;completes what those who dwell here expiate.;kirkpatrick
2;6;5454;40;So, in the passage where I made this point,;kirkpatrick
2;6;5455;41;no ﬂaw could ever be redeemed by prayer.;kirkpatrick
2;6;5456;42;For prayer was then not linked or joined to God.;kirkpatrick
2;6;5457;43;Yet do not, truly, let your question rest;kirkpatrick
2;6;5458;44;until the one who’ll come as light between;kirkpatrick
2;6;5459;45;your intellect and truth declares you may.;kirkpatrick
2;6;5460;46;I don’t know if you take my sense. I mean;kirkpatrick
2;6;5461;47;Beatrice. You’ll see her up above,;kirkpatrick
2;6;5462;48;smiling, in all her happiness, on the crest.’;kirkpatrick
2;6;5463;49;‘My lord,’ I said, ‘let’s move with greater haste.;kirkpatrick
2;6;5464;50;I’m not as wearied as I was before.;kirkpatrick
2;6;5465;51;And – look – the mountain’s casting shadow now.’;kirkpatrick
2;6;5466;52;‘While daylight lasts,’ he answered me, ‘we’ll press;kirkpatrick
2;6;5467;53;our way as far ahead as we still can.;kirkpatrick
2;6;5468;54;But things have not the shape that you suppose.;kirkpatrick
2;6;5469;55;Before you reach that height, you’ll see return;kirkpatrick
2;6;5470;56;the one who now is hidden by the ridge –;kirkpatrick
2;6;5471;57;so you cannot, now, break the light he sheds.;kirkpatrick
2;6;5472;58;But over there you see a soul alone,;kirkpatrick
2;6;5473;59;alone placed there who stares across at us.;kirkpatrick
2;6;5474;60;This one will teach us what’s the quickest way.’;kirkpatrick
2;6;5475;61;We came towards it. O you Lombard soul!;kirkpatrick
2;6;5476;62;How proud you stood, how haughty in your look,;kirkpatrick
2;6;5477;63;your moving eye so grave and digniﬁed.;kirkpatrick
2;6;5478;64;The soul did not say anything at all.;kirkpatrick
2;6;5479;65;It let us make our way, still looking on,;kirkpatrick
2;6;5480;66;as hunting lions do that pause and couch.;kirkpatrick
2;6;5481;67;But Virgil went across to him, and asked;kirkpatrick
2;6;5482;68;that we be shown a better path to climb.;kirkpatrick
2;6;5483;69;To this request, the soul made no reply.;kirkpatrick
2;6;5484;70;About our origins, our towns and lives,;kirkpatrick
2;6;5485;71;he questioned us. My thoughtful guide began:;kirkpatrick
2;6;5486;72;‘Mantua…’ The shade – so dark-cowled, sunk within –;kirkpatrick
2;6;5487;73;rose up towards him from where ﬁrst he’d been,;kirkpatrick
2;6;5488;74;saying: ‘You Mantuan! I am Sordello.;kirkpatrick
2;6;5489;75;Your fellow citizen.’ And each round each ﬂung arms.;kirkpatrick
2;6;5490;76;You! Vile Italia! Sorrow’s resting place!;kirkpatrick
2;6;5491;77;You hulk that no one steers through raging storms!;kirkpatrick
2;6;5492;78;No sovereign lady, you’re a cat house whore!;kirkpatrick
2;6;5493;79;That noble soul was moved with such great speed;kirkpatrick
2;6;5494;80;to greet his fellow citizen, to hear –;kirkpatrick
2;6;5495;81;no more than that! – the sweet sound of their home.;kirkpatrick
2;6;5496;82;Yet those who live within your boundaries;kirkpatrick
2;6;5497;83;stand nowhere free of war. Each gnaws the next,;kirkpatrick
2;6;5498;84;all locked together by one wall and moat.;kirkpatrick
2;6;5499;85;Search hard, you wretch, round all your ocean shores;kirkpatrick
2;6;5500;86;then turn towards your heart, and try to see;kirkpatrick
2;6;5501;87;if any of its parts rejoice in peace.;kirkpatrick
2;6;5502;88;Why should Justinian have formed your reins?;kirkpatrick
2;6;5503;89;What use is that? The saddle’s riderless.;kirkpatrick
2;6;5504;90;The shame would be far less were there no curb.;kirkpatrick
2;6;5505;91;You people! If you only understood;kirkpatrick
2;6;5506;92;what God intends you’d be more reverent,;kirkpatrick
2;6;5507;93;and let the saddle be great Caesar’s seat.;kirkpatrick
2;6;5508;94;Just look how ﬁerce and cruel the beast’s become.;kirkpatrick
2;6;5509;95;No spur to set it on its proper course,;kirkpatrick
2;6;5510;96;since you, Italia, took the bridle up.;kirkpatrick
2;6;5511;97;You German Albert! You abandon her,;kirkpatrick
2;6;5512;98;so hard to handle now, untamed and wild,;kirkpatrick
2;6;5513;99;you who should sit astride her saddle bows.;kirkpatrick
2;6;5514;100;May justice from the stars fall, rightly, down;kirkpatrick
2;6;5515;101;on your tribe’s blood. May that come strange and clear, to;kirkpatrick
2;6;5516;102;make your heir feel all the dread of it.;kirkpatrick
2;6;5517;103;Held back in Germany by raging greed,;kirkpatrick
2;6;5518;104;your father did – as you now – tolerate;kirkpatrick
2;6;5519;105;the Empire’s garden to lie desolate.;kirkpatrick
2;6;5520;106;Come! See the Montagues and Capulets,;kirkpatrick
2;6;5521;107;Monaldi, Filippeschi, reckless men,;kirkpatrick
2;6;5522;108;some plunged in misery and some in fear!;kirkpatrick
2;6;5523;109;Come, cruel man, and see the great distress;kirkpatrick
2;6;5524;110;of all your nobles. Cure them of their warts.;kirkpatrick
2;6;5525;111;You’ll see how Santa Fiora is eclipsed.;kirkpatrick
2;6;5526;112;Come now, and see that Rome of yours in tears.;kirkpatrick
2;6;5527;113;Widowed and lonely, day and night she weeps:;kirkpatrick
2;6;5528;114;‘Say why, dear Caesar, you’re not with me now.’;kirkpatrick
2;6;5529;115;Come now, and see the love between these folk.;kirkpatrick
2;6;5530;116;And if no pity for us makes you move,;kirkpatrick
2;6;5531;117;come, be ashamed to know what name you’ve won.;kirkpatrick
2;6;5532;118;And if, great Jove, once cruciﬁed for us,;kirkpatrick
2;6;5533;119;it is permissible for me to say,;kirkpatrick
2;6;5534;120;then why are Your just eyes now turned elsewhere?;kirkpatrick
2;6;5535;121;Or is all this a preparation, formed;kirkpatrick
2;6;5536;122;within the chasm of Your wisdom, for some good;kirkpatrick
2;6;5537;123;cut oﬀ completely from our power to see?;kirkpatrick
2;6;5538;124;In Italy, the cities are all full;kirkpatrick
2;6;5539;125;of petty despots. Every country lout;kirkpatrick
2;6;5540;126;who joins a gang is rebel Marcellus.;kirkpatrick
2;6;5541;127;Dear Florence, you may well content yourself;kirkpatrick
2;6;5542;128;with this parenthesis, which can’t touch you,;kirkpatrick
2;6;5543;129;all thanks, of course, to your so brilliant crew.;kirkpatrick
2;6;5544;130;Many, though true at heart, are slow to shoot,;kirkpatrick
2;6;5545;131;for fear, without advice, they’d rush the bow.;kirkpatrick
2;6;5546;132;But your lot tongue-tip justice all the time.;kirkpatrick
2;6;5547;133;Many refuse to take on public tasks.;kirkpatrick
2;6;5548;134;But your lot, so solicitous, unasked,;kirkpatrick
2;6;5549;135;reply with shouts: ‘Let me! I’m up for that!’;kirkpatrick
2;6;5550;136;Look happy now. You’ve every reason to,;kirkpatrick
2;6;5551;137;rich as you are, at peace and oh-so-wise.;kirkpatrick
2;6;5552;138;The outcome does not hide that I speak true.;kirkpatrick
2;6;5553;139;Athens and Lacedaemon, which ﬁrst made;kirkpatrick
2;6;5554;140;the ancient law, and were so civilized,;kirkpatrick
2;6;5555;141;made, as to living well, the faintest mark;kirkpatrick
2;6;5556;142;compared to you who make such delicate;kirkpatrick
2;6;5557;143;provisions in your laws that what you spin;kirkpatrick
2;6;5558;144;won’t reach from mid-October to November’s end.;kirkpatrick
2;6;5559;145;How many times within your memory;kirkpatrick
2;6;5560;146;have you, renewing all your limbs, transformed;kirkpatrick
2;6;5561;147;duties and laws and coinage and customs?;kirkpatrick
2;6;5562;148;And if you’ll know yourself and see the light,;kirkpatrick
2;6;5563;149;you’ll see how like you are to some sick hag,;kirkpatrick
2;6;5564;150;who ﬁnds no comfort on her feather bed,;kirkpatrick
2;6;5565;151;but shields herself from pain with every squirm.;kirkpatrick
2;7;5566;1;Three or four times, with solemn happiness,;kirkpatrick
2;7;5567;2;the welcome each gave each had been renewed;kirkpatrick
2;7;5568;3;till, drawing back, Sordello said: ‘Who are you?’;kirkpatrick
2;7;5569;4;‘Before the time that souls were turned, when ﬁt,;kirkpatrick
2;7;5570;5;in dignity, for God, to this great mount,;kirkpatrick
2;7;5571;6;my bones were buried by Octavian.;kirkpatrick
2;7;5572;7;I am Vergilius. And for no crime,;kirkpatrick
2;7;5573;8;save lack of faith, I lost the heavenly sky.’;kirkpatrick
2;7;5574;9;This was the answer that my lord then gave.;kirkpatrick
2;7;5575;10;Like someone on the sudden who, before;kirkpatrick
2;7;5576;11;his eyes, sees what he can’t help marvelling at, can’t;kirkpatrick
2;7;5577;12;credit it but does, and says ‘It is…It’s not…’,  so did;kirkpatrick
2;7;5578;13;Sordello, and he bent his brow,;kirkpatrick
2;7;5579;14;then, turning back to Virgil, ﬂung once more;kirkpatrick
2;7;5580;15;his arms round where inferiors embrace.;kirkpatrick
2;7;5581;16;‘You glory of the Latin race,’ he said,;kirkpatrick
2;7;5582;17;‘through you our tongue was shown what it could do.;kirkpatrick
2;7;5583;18;Eternal honour of where I, once, was.;kirkpatrick
2;7;5584;19;What merit or what grace shows you to me?;kirkpatrick
2;7;5585;20;If I am ﬁt to listen to your words,;kirkpatrick
2;7;5586;21;say – if you come from Hell – what cloister’s yours.’;kirkpatrick
2;7;5587;22;‘Through all the circles of the grieving realm;kirkpatrick
2;7;5588;23;I’ve come,’ he answered him, ‘and now I’m here.;kirkpatrick
2;7;5589;24;A power in Heaven ﬁrst moved me. So I come.;kirkpatrick
2;7;5590;25;Through nothing I had done but what I’d not ,;kirkpatrick
2;7;5591;26;my sight lost that great Sun that you desire,;kirkpatrick
2;7;5592;27;known too belatedly in time for me.;kirkpatrick
2;7;5593;28;There is a place down there not grim with pain;kirkpatrick
2;7;5594;29;but only with sad shades whose deep laments;kirkpatrick
2;7;5595;30;sound not as screams but melancholy sighs.;kirkpatrick
2;7;5596;31;I take my place with children – innocents;kirkpatrick
2;7;5597;32;in whom the bite of death set lethal teeth;kirkpatrick
2;7;5598;33;before they’d been made free of human sin.;kirkpatrick
2;7;5599;34;And there I stay with all who were not clothed;kirkpatrick
2;7;5600;35;in those three holy virtues – though I knew,;kirkpatrick
2;7;5601;36;and, guiltless, followed all the other four.;kirkpatrick
2;7;5602;37;But give us – if you know and can – some sign;kirkpatrick
2;7;5603;38;so we can come more quickly to the place;kirkpatrick
2;7;5604;39;at which the proper Purgatory begins.’;kirkpatrick
2;7;5605;40;He answered: ‘No ﬁxed ground is given us.;kirkpatrick
2;7;5606;41;I am allowed to travel up and round.;kirkpatrick
2;7;5607;42;As far as I can go, I’ll be your guide.;kirkpatrick
2;7;5608;43;But look! The day by now is going down.;kirkpatrick
2;7;5609;44;And none by night can ever make the climb.;kirkpatrick
2;7;5610;45;Better to think of some good resting place.;kirkpatrick
2;7;5611;46;There are, towards the right, souls hidden here.;kirkpatrick
2;7;5612;47;I’ll lead you on to them, if you agree,;kirkpatrick
2;7;5613;48;and you’ll not want for pleasure, knowing them.’;kirkpatrick
2;7;5614;49;‘But how is that?’ the answer came. ‘Would those;kirkpatrick
2;7;5615;50;who wished to make ascent at night be checked;kirkpatrick
2;7;5616;51;by someone else, or simply lack the power?’;kirkpatrick
2;7;5617;52;Sordello drew his ﬁnger on the ground,;kirkpatrick
2;7;5618;53;saying – that good man – ‘There! You see that line?;kirkpatrick
2;7;5619;54;You could not cross it once the sun was down.;kirkpatrick
2;7;5620;55;Not, though, because there’s anything to bar;kirkpatrick
2;7;5621;56;your going up, save shadows of the night.;kirkpatrick
2;7;5622;57;It’s that which knots the will in powerlessness.;kirkpatrick
2;7;5623;58;We could, of course, descend and walk below;kirkpatrick
2;7;5624;59;and, while the far horizons keep day shut,;kirkpatrick
2;7;5625;60;wander and take a turn around the coast.’;kirkpatrick
2;7;5626;61;My lord, then, as though wondering at these words,;kirkpatrick
2;7;5627;62;replied: ‘So lead us on to where, you say,;kirkpatrick
2;7;5628;63;it’s possible to linger in delight.’;kirkpatrick
2;7;5629;64;We’d only gone a little way from there;kirkpatrick
2;7;5630;65;when, so I saw, the mountain hollowed out,;kirkpatrick
2;7;5631;66;as, here, our valleys hollow earthly hills.;kirkpatrick
2;7;5632;67;‘Just over there!’ the shade now said to us.;kirkpatrick
2;7;5633;68;‘We’ll go to where the cliﬀ has formed a lap, and there;kirkpatrick
2;7;5634;69;await the coming of new day.’;kirkpatrick
2;7;5635;70;Slanting between the level and the steep,;kirkpatrick
2;7;5636;71;a tight path led us to the dale’s low edge –;kirkpatrick
2;7;5637;72;the bank’s rim here diminishing to half.;kirkpatrick
2;7;5638;73;Gold, ﬁnest silver, cochineal, white lead,;kirkpatrick
2;7;5639;74;indigo, ebony polished to a sheen,;kirkpatrick
2;7;5640;75;the freshest emeralds when they’ve just been split,;kirkpatrick
2;7;5641;76;each in pure colour would be overcome;kirkpatrick
2;7;5642;77;by all the ﬂowers and grasses in that fold –;kirkpatrick
2;7;5643;78;as by the greater any lesser is.;kirkpatrick
2;7;5644;79;Nor had great nature worked in paint alone.;kirkpatrick
2;7;5645;80;She also with a thousand perfumes wrought;kirkpatrick
2;7;5646;81;a sweetness never known and indistinct.;kirkpatrick
2;7;5647;82;‘Salve, Regina’ . on the ﬂowering greens,;kirkpatrick
2;7;5648;83;the souls, I saw, not seen beyond the vale,;kirkpatrick
2;7;5649;84;all sat together as they sang this hymn.;kirkpatrick
2;7;5650;85;‘Until what little sun remains nests down,’;kirkpatrick
2;7;5651;86;the Mantuan who’d led us there began,;kirkpatrick
2;7;5652;87;‘don’t ask me to escort you down to them.;kirkpatrick
2;7;5653;88;You’ll better see by staying on this ledge;kirkpatrick
2;7;5654;89;the faces, looks and gestures of these kings;kirkpatrick
2;7;5655;90;than if you’d been received within their glade.;kirkpatrick
2;7;5656;91;The one who’s seated highest, and (in look);kirkpatrick
2;7;5657;92;neglected what his proper duty urged,;kirkpatrick
2;7;5658;93;and does not move his lips while others sing,;kirkpatrick
2;7;5659;94;was Rudolph who, as emperor, could have healed;kirkpatrick
2;7;5660;95;the wounds that did Italia to death;kirkpatrick
2;7;5661;96;so that no others will revive her soon.;kirkpatrick
2;7;5662;97;The next, who seems to oﬀer him support,;kirkpatrick
2;7;5663;98;ruled in that country where those waters rise;kirkpatrick
2;7;5664;99;that bear to Elbe the Moldau and the Elbe to sea.;kirkpatrick
2;7;5665;100;His name was Ottakar – a better prince,;kirkpatrick
2;7;5666;101;even when baby-clothed, than Wenceslaus,;kirkpatrick
2;7;5667;102;his son who, bearded, grazed on lust and ease.;kirkpatrick
2;7;5668;103;And that one – button-nosed – who seems so caught;kirkpatrick
2;7;5669;104;in conversation with the kind-faced man;kirkpatrick
2;7;5670;105;died, ﬂeeing, as he stripped the lily ﬂower.;kirkpatrick
2;7;5671;106;Look at him! how he pounds on his own breast.;kirkpatrick
2;7;5672;107;And see the next who’s spread his palm to form a bed on;kirkpatrick
2;7;5673;108;which to lay his sighing cheek.;kirkpatrick
2;7;5674;109;Father these are and in-law to the Ill;kirkpatrick
2;7;5675;110;of France. His vicious, ﬁlthy life they know – and hence the;kirkpatrick
2;7;5676;111;grief transﬁxing each alike.;kirkpatrick
2;7;5677;112;And that lord there – the burly type – who sings;kirkpatrick
2;7;5678;113;in concert with the one of manly nose,;kirkpatrick
2;7;5679;114;bore, as his knightly belt, all worth and strength.;kirkpatrick
2;7;5680;115;And if that young boy sitting at his back;kirkpatrick
2;7;5681;116;could still, succeeding him, have been the king, true merit;kirkpatrick
2;7;5682;117;would have ﬂowed from urn to urn –  which none;kirkpatrick
2;7;5683;118;could argue of his other heirs.;kirkpatrick
2;7;5684;119;For James and Frederick rule his kingdoms now;kirkpatrick
2;7;5685;120;and no one holds his better heritage.;kirkpatrick
2;7;5686;121;It seldom happens that man’s probity;kirkpatrick
2;7;5687;122;will rise through every branch. He wills it thus, so, given;kirkpatrick
2;7;5688;123;from beyond, it’s known as His.;kirkpatrick
2;7;5689;124;These words go out to that one with the nose;kirkpatrick
2;7;5690;125;no less than to Pier, who sings with him,;kirkpatrick
2;7;5691;126;whom Puglia and Provence already mourn.;kirkpatrick
2;7;5692;127;The tree is that much less than its own seed,;kirkpatrick
2;7;5693;128;as Constance can applaud her husband more;kirkpatrick
2;7;5694;129;than Marguerite and Beatrice can.;kirkpatrick
2;7;5695;130;See there the monarch of the simple life,;kirkpatrick
2;7;5696;131;Henry of England, sitting all alone.;kirkpatrick
2;7;5697;132;He in his branches comes much better oﬀ.;kirkpatrick
2;7;5698;133;The one among them lower, on the ground,;kirkpatrick
2;7;5699;134;is Marquis William, looking to the heights.;kirkpatrick
2;7;5700;135;For him, the wars of Alessandria;kirkpatrick
2;7;5701;136;make Canavese and Montferrat weep.;kirkpatrick
2;8;5702;1;It was, by now, the hour that turns to home;kirkpatrick
2;8;5703;2;the longing thoughts of seamen, melting hearts;kirkpatrick
2;8;5704;3;the day they’ve said goodbye to dearest friends,;kirkpatrick
2;8;5705;4;and when by love the pilgrim, new to this,;kirkpatrick
2;8;5706;5;is pierced to hear, far oﬀ, the evening bell;kirkpatrick
2;8;5707;6;that seems to mourn the dying of the day,;kirkpatrick
2;8;5708;7;as I began to blank my hearing out,;kirkpatrick
2;8;5709;8;and gaze in wonder at a single soul;kirkpatrick
2;8;5710;9;who, risen up, hand raised, asked all to hear.;kirkpatrick
2;8;5711;10;This soul, ﬁrst, joined his palms then lifted them,;kirkpatrick
2;8;5712;11;eyes ﬁxed towards the orient, as though;kirkpatrick
2;8;5713;12;to say to God: ‘For nothing else I care.’;kirkpatrick
2;8;5714;13;‘Te lucis ante’ issued from his lips;kirkpatrick
2;8;5715;14;with such devotion and each note so sweet;kirkpatrick
2;8;5716;15;it made me wander out of conscious thought.;kirkpatrick
2;8;5717;16;Then, sweetly and devoutly, all the rest,;kirkpatrick
2;8;5718;17;their eyes all turned to those supernal wheels,;kirkpatrick
2;8;5719;18;picked up from him and sang the hymn in full.;kirkpatrick
2;8;5720;19;Reader, now ﬁx a needle eye on truth.;kirkpatrick
2;8;5721;20;The veil is, after all, so gauzy here;kirkpatrick
2;8;5722;21;you’ll thread it through as lightly as can be.;kirkpatrick
2;8;5723;22;I saw the noble army of those souls;kirkpatrick
2;8;5724;23;in silence turn their gaze towards the sky –;kirkpatrick
2;8;5725;24;as though awaiting something – meek and pale.;kirkpatrick
2;8;5726;25;And then I saw, descending from the height,;kirkpatrick
2;8;5727;26;two angels with two swords, each ﬂashing ﬁre,;kirkpatrick
2;8;5728;27;the point of each was blunt and broken oﬀ.;kirkpatrick
2;8;5729;28;As green as are the freshest newborn leaves,;kirkpatrick
2;8;5730;29;so were their garments, fanned by bright, green wings;kirkpatrick
2;8;5731;30;which, drawn behind them, rustled as they beat.;kirkpatrick
2;8;5732;31;One came to stand a little from our heads.;kirkpatrick
2;8;5733;32;The other lighted on the farther bank.;kirkpatrick
2;8;5734;33;The people, thus, were held between the two.;kirkpatrick
2;8;5735;34;Their hair was blond. And this I clearly saw.;kirkpatrick
2;8;5736;35;But looking at their faces, sight was lost –;kirkpatrick
2;8;5737;36;as natural powers fail, tested to excess.;kirkpatrick
2;8;5738;37;‘These two,’ as now Sordello said, ‘have come;kirkpatrick
2;8;5739;38;as guardians of the vale, from Mary’s breast,;kirkpatrick
2;8;5740;39;against the serpent who’ll soon pass this way.’;kirkpatrick
2;8;5741;40;I, ignorant of where the snake would come,;kirkpatrick
2;8;5742;41;span all around and huddled closer up,;kirkpatrick
2;8;5743;42;frozen with dread, to Virgil’s trusted side.;kirkpatrick
2;8;5744;43;Sordello once again spoke out: ‘Let’s go;kirkpatrick
2;8;5745;44;and talk down there among those famous shades.;kirkpatrick
2;8;5746;45;To see you will, for them, be welcome grace.’;kirkpatrick
2;8;5747;46;Three paces only had I gone, perhaps,;kirkpatrick
2;8;5748;47;and there I was. And one of them, I saw,;kirkpatrick
2;8;5749;48;stared, wondering who I was, at me (yes, me!).;kirkpatrick
2;8;5750;49;The time had come when air was turning black –;kirkpatrick
2;8;5751;50;not yet so dark, though, that, between our eyes,;kirkpatrick
2;8;5752;51;what ﬁrst had been locked up should not be clear.;kirkpatrick
2;8;5753;52;He made towards me, as I did to him.;kirkpatrick
2;8;5754;53;Noble judge Nino, how it pleased me then;kirkpatrick
2;8;5755;54;to see you weren’t among the guilty souls.;kirkpatrick
2;8;5756;55;No courteous welcome now remained unsaid.;kirkpatrick
2;8;5757;56;‘How long,’ he asked, ‘since, over distant waves,;kirkpatrick
2;8;5758;57;you reached the foothills that surround this shore?’;kirkpatrick
2;8;5759;58;‘Oh! Through unhappy regions,’ I replied,;kirkpatrick
2;8;5760;59;‘I came at dawn. I’m still in my ﬁrst life –;kirkpatrick
2;8;5761;60;though travelling here, I gain the other, too.’;kirkpatrick
2;8;5762;61;And once the meaning of my words was heard,;kirkpatrick
2;8;5763;62;he (and Sordello, also) drew away,;kirkpatrick
2;8;5764;63;as people do when suddenly confused.;kirkpatrick
2;8;5765;64;One turned to Virgil, while the other turned;kirkpatrick
2;8;5766;65;to someone sitting there, and cried aloud:;kirkpatrick
2;8;5767;66;‘Conrad, get up! Just see what God’s grace wills!’;kirkpatrick
2;8;5768;67;Then facing me: ‘I pray you – by the thanks,;kirkpatrick
2;8;5769;68;so singular, you owe to Him who hides;kirkpatrick
2;8;5770;69;His ﬁrst “because” so none can pass that stream,;kirkpatrick
2;8;5771;70;when once you’re back beyond the far-ﬂung sea,;kirkpatrick
2;8;5772;71;then tell my dear Giovanna she should call,;kirkpatrick
2;8;5773;72;on my behalf, to where the pure are heard.;kirkpatrick
2;8;5774;73;I do not think her mother loves me now.;kirkpatrick
2;8;5775;74;For she has changed her widowhood’s white veil –;kirkpatrick
2;8;5776;75;which, wretchedly, she’ll yearn for once again.;kirkpatrick
2;8;5777;76;Because of her, one readily can see;kirkpatrick
2;8;5778;77;how long the ﬁre of love in women lasts,;kirkpatrick
2;8;5779;78;if eye and touch don’t often kindle it.;kirkpatrick
2;8;5780;79;The viper of the Milanese camp;kirkpatrick
2;8;5781;80;will make for her less splendid burial;kirkpatrick
2;8;5782;81;than my Gallurian cockerel would have done.’;kirkpatrick
2;8;5783;82;He said all this, his face marked by the stamp;kirkpatrick
2;8;5784;83;of that true zeal that burned with measured ﬂame;kirkpatrick
2;8;5785;84;within him in his truest heart of hearts.;kirkpatrick
2;8;5786;85;My eyes still, avidly, were on the skies;kirkpatrick
2;8;5787;86;ﬁxed where the stars ran slowest in their track,;kirkpatrick
2;8;5788;87;as wheels do closest to the axle tree.;kirkpatrick
2;8;5789;88;My guide: ‘Dear son, what do you see up there?’;kirkpatrick
2;8;5790;89;‘Those three sharp torches,’ I replied to him,;kirkpatrick
2;8;5791;90;‘with which the southern pole is all ablaze.’;kirkpatrick
2;8;5792;91;His answer to me was: ‘The four bright stars;kirkpatrick
2;8;5793;92;that you saw just this morning sink down there.;kirkpatrick
2;8;5794;93;And these have risen now to where they were.’;kirkpatrick
2;8;5795;94;As he said this, Sordello drew him close,;kirkpatrick
2;8;5796;95;saying: ‘Look there! You see? Our enemy!’;kirkpatrick
2;8;5797;96;He stretched his ﬁnger, showing where to look.;kirkpatrick
2;8;5798;97;From that side where this little valley had;kirkpatrick
2;8;5799;98;no sheltering barrier, a snake appeared,;kirkpatrick
2;8;5800;99;perhaps like that which fed Eve bitter food.;kirkpatrick
2;8;5801;100;Through grass and ﬂowers this evil smear came on,;kirkpatrick
2;8;5802;101;rolling its head around from time to time,;kirkpatrick
2;8;5803;102;licking its back as preening beasts will do.;kirkpatrick
2;8;5804;103;I did not see – and so I cannot say –;kirkpatrick
2;8;5805;104;how those celestial hawks began to move.;kirkpatrick
2;8;5806;105;I did, though, see the motion that each made.;kirkpatrick
2;8;5807;106;Sensing the air ripped open by green wings,;kirkpatrick
2;8;5808;107;the serpent ﬂed and both the angels turned,;kirkpatrick
2;8;5809;108;ﬂying at equal pace, to their high posts.;kirkpatrick
2;8;5810;109;The shadow that had drawn, when called, towards;kirkpatrick
2;8;5811;110;the judge, had not, throughout this whole attack,;kirkpatrick
2;8;5812;111;at any point released me from his gaze.;kirkpatrick
2;8;5813;112;‘May that great lamp that leads you to the height;kirkpatrick
2;8;5814;113;discern in your free will suﬃcient wax;kirkpatrick
2;8;5815;114;to light your way to that ﬂower-studded peak,’;kirkpatrick
2;8;5816;115;(so he began). ‘If you have truthful news;kirkpatrick
2;8;5817;116;of Val di Magra or the neighbouring place,;kirkpatrick
2;8;5818;117;then tell me. I was once a great man there.;kirkpatrick
2;8;5819;118;I was, by name, Currado Malaspina,;kirkpatrick
2;8;5820;119;not the great ancient but of his descent.;kirkpatrick
2;8;5821;120;I bore love – here reﬁned – towards my kin.’;kirkpatrick
2;8;5822;121;‘Oh! I have never been,’ I said, ‘through lands;kirkpatrick
2;8;5823;122;of yours. Yet who in Europe anywhere;kirkpatrick
2;8;5824;123;is there to whom your name is not well known?;kirkpatrick
2;8;5825;124;The fame that brings such lustre to your house;kirkpatrick
2;8;5826;125;exalts your lords, exalts all your domains,;kirkpatrick
2;8;5827;126;so that all know it, though they’ve not been there.;kirkpatrick
2;8;5828;127;I swear to you (so may I reach the heights!);kirkpatrick
2;8;5829;128;that your much-honoured race goes still unstripped of;kirkpatrick
2;8;5830;129;worthiness and prize in purse and sword.;kirkpatrick
2;8;5831;130;Nature and how they act so honours them;kirkpatrick
2;8;5832;131;that, though the world’s vile head may twist awry, they all;kirkpatrick
2;8;5833;132;walk straight, and scorn the evil way.’;kirkpatrick
2;8;5834;133;And he: ‘Go on like that. The sun won’t sink;kirkpatrick
2;8;5835;134;within the bed that Ram Stars – all four feet;kirkpatrick
2;8;5836;135;astraddle – cover for more than seven times;kirkpatrick
2;8;5837;136;before the courtesy that you express;kirkpatrick
2;8;5838;137;is nailed within the centre of your brain;kirkpatrick
2;8;5839;138;with greater nails than hearsay brings to you –;kirkpatrick
2;8;5840;139;if judgement is not halted in its course.’;kirkpatrick
2;9;5841;1;The concubine of timeworn Tithonus;kirkpatrick
2;9;5842;2;already on the eastern balcony,;kirkpatrick
2;9;5843;3;out of her dear love’s arms, was glimmering white.;kirkpatrick
2;9;5844;4;Her forehead shone with gemstones in the form;kirkpatrick
2;9;5845;5;of that chill animal, the Scorpion,;kirkpatrick
2;9;5846;6;that strikes then stings us with its vicious tail.;kirkpatrick
2;9;5847;7;The night which rises step by step had now,;kirkpatrick
2;9;5848;8;where we’d arrived, advanced by two of these,;kirkpatrick
2;9;5849;9;the third already lowering on the wing,;kirkpatrick
2;9;5850;10;when I – some trace of Adam with me still –;kirkpatrick
2;9;5851;11;conquered by sleep, bowed down towards the grass;kirkpatrick
2;9;5852;12;where all the ﬁve of us had come to sit.;kirkpatrick
2;9;5853;13;In that hour when the swallow, near to dawn,;kirkpatrick
2;9;5854;14;begins once more her long sad chant, perhaps;kirkpatrick
2;9;5855;15;recalling all the miseries she’d borne,;kirkpatrick
2;9;5856;16;and when our minds like hawks on foreign tracks;kirkpatrick
2;9;5857;17;furthest from ﬂesh, least caught in their own thoughts, are;kirkpatrick
2;9;5858;18;near divine in visions that they see,;kirkpatrick
2;9;5859;19;as in some dream, there hovering, it seemed;kirkpatrick
2;9;5860;20;I saw an eagle in the sky. Its plumes were gold,;kirkpatrick
2;9;5861;21;its wings wide spread, its purpose soon to swoop.;kirkpatrick
2;9;5862;22;And I, it seemed to me, was where the kin;kirkpatrick
2;9;5863;23;of Ganymede, when he was seized – swept up;kirkpatrick
2;9;5864;24;towards the highest court – remained abandoned.;kirkpatrick
2;9;5865;25;Just to myself, ‘Perhaps,’ I thought, ‘this strikes;kirkpatrick
2;9;5866;26;only by habit here, perhaps it scorns;kirkpatrick
2;9;5867;27;to carry things from elsewhere in its claws.’;kirkpatrick
2;9;5868;28;And then it seemed that, wheeling slightly round,;kirkpatrick
2;9;5869;29;as terrible as lightning, down it struck;kirkpatrick
2;9;5870;30;and tore me upwards to the sphere of ﬁre.;kirkpatrick
2;9;5871;31;And there the eagle and I, it seemed, both blazed.;kirkpatrick
2;9;5872;32;And this imagined ﬁre so scorched and seared;kirkpatrick
2;9;5873;33;that, yielding, dreaming sleep just had to break.;kirkpatrick
2;9;5874;34;Not very diﬀerently, Achilles woke,;kirkpatrick
2;9;5875;35;his startled eyes now staring all around,;kirkpatrick
2;9;5876;36;dazed, knowing nothing of where he might be,;kirkpatrick
2;9;5877;37;his mother having ﬂed with him asleep;kirkpatrick
2;9;5878;38;within her arms from Chiron’s care to Skyros.;kirkpatrick
2;9;5879;39;(The Greeks would, after, make him leave that place.);kirkpatrick
2;9;5880;40;So too I shook myself as, from my face,;kirkpatrick
2;9;5881;41;sleep ﬂed, and deathly pale I then became,;kirkpatrick
2;9;5882;42;turning, as terriﬁed we do, to ice.;kirkpatrick
2;9;5883;43;Beside me, there was only my great strength.;kirkpatrick
2;9;5884;44;The sun by now was more than two hours high.;kirkpatrick
2;9;5885;45;My eyes were turned back down towards the sea.;kirkpatrick
2;9;5886;46;My lord said, ‘Have no fear. Be conﬁdent.;kirkpatrick
2;9;5887;47;For we have reached a good point in our way.;kirkpatrick
2;9;5888;48;Do not hold back, but give your strengths free rein.;kirkpatrick
2;9;5889;49;You’ve now arrived where Purgatory begins.;kirkpatrick
2;9;5890;50;See over there the wall encircling it.;kirkpatrick
2;9;5891;51;See there the portal where the wall is breached.;kirkpatrick
2;9;5892;52;Just now, at dawn which comes before new day,;kirkpatrick
2;9;5893;53;when still your soul was sleeping deep within,;kirkpatrick
2;9;5894;54;couched on the ﬂowers that ornament that place,;kirkpatrick
2;9;5895;55;a lady came. She said, “I am Lucia.;kirkpatrick
2;9;5896;56;Let me take up the man who’s sleeping there,;kirkpatrick
2;9;5897;57;so I can make his journey easier.”;kirkpatrick
2;9;5898;58;Sordello and those noble forms stayed back.;kirkpatrick
2;9;5899;59;She took you up and, once the day shone clear,;kirkpatrick
2;9;5900;60;she came up here, I following in her steps.;kirkpatrick
2;9;5901;61;She laid you down. But, ﬁrst, her lovely eyes;kirkpatrick
2;9;5902;62;displayed to me the entrance open there.;kirkpatrick
2;9;5903;63;Then she and sleep that instant went away.’;kirkpatrick
2;9;5904;64;As, doubting, people do when reassured –;kirkpatrick
2;9;5905;65;changing to conﬁdence the fears they had,;kirkpatrick
2;9;5906;66;once what is true has been revealed to them –;kirkpatrick
2;9;5907;67;so I, too, changed. And since my leader saw;kirkpatrick
2;9;5908;68;that I had now no cares, he moved to climb,;kirkpatrick
2;9;5909;69;with me behind him still, the wall towards its height.;kirkpatrick
2;9;5910;70;You, reader, can now see how here I raise;kirkpatrick
2;9;5911;71;the theme my verse attempts. Don’t marvel, then,;kirkpatrick
2;9;5912;72;if with more craft and art I strengthen it.;kirkpatrick
2;9;5913;73;We now drew closer and were in that part;kirkpatrick
2;9;5914;74;where, ﬁrst, as I had thought, a breach appeared,;kirkpatrick
2;9;5915;75;as might some ﬁssure that divides a wall.;kirkpatrick
2;9;5916;76;And now I saw a gate and, leading there,;kirkpatrick
2;9;5917;77;three steps beneath, each coloured diﬀerently,;kirkpatrick
2;9;5918;78;and at that gate a guardian who spoke no word.;kirkpatrick
2;9;5919;79;And as I opened more my eyes to this,;kirkpatrick
2;9;5920;80;I saw him sitting on the highest stair.;kirkpatrick
2;9;5921;81;His face was such I could not bear that light.;kirkpatrick
2;9;5922;82;A naked sword he held within his hand;kirkpatrick
2;9;5923;83;which so reﬂected sun rays back at me;kirkpatrick
2;9;5924;84;that many times I ﬁxed my eyes in vain.;kirkpatrick
2;9;5925;85;‘Speak from back there! And say what is your will.’;kirkpatrick
2;9;5926;86;So he began. ‘And tell me, where’s your guide?;kirkpatrick
2;9;5927;87;Take care, lest going up should cause you harm.’;kirkpatrick
2;9;5928;88;‘From Heaven, a lady, knowing all these things,;kirkpatrick
2;9;5929;89;told us a short time past,’ my teacher answered,;kirkpatrick
2;9;5930;90;“‘Go forward for the gate you seek is here.’”;kirkpatrick
2;9;5931;91;‘May she advance your steps in doing well,’;kirkpatrick
2;9;5932;92;once more the courteous guardian began:;kirkpatrick
2;9;5933;93;‘Come forward, therefore, to these stairs of ours.’;kirkpatrick
2;9;5934;94;And there we came to them. The ﬁrst great block;kirkpatrick
2;9;5935;95;was marble, white, so burnished and so clean;kirkpatrick
2;9;5936;96;that I as I appear was mirroired there.;kirkpatrick
2;9;5937;97;The second, in its tint more dark than perse,;kirkpatrick
2;9;5938;98;was rock – waste, rough to touch and scorched and dry,;kirkpatrick
2;9;5939;99;cracked both across and upward to its height.;kirkpatrick
2;9;5940;100;The third, which, massively, weighed these two down,;kirkpatrick
2;9;5941;101;was porphyry, it seemed, and ﬂamed as bright;kirkpatrick
2;9;5942;102;as fresh blood spurting from a severed vein.;kirkpatrick
2;9;5943;103;And, on this third, the angel of the Lord;kirkpatrick
2;9;5944;104;had placed both feet and sat across the threshold,;kirkpatrick
2;9;5945;105;which, as it seemed, was adamantine stone.;kirkpatrick
2;9;5946;106;Up these three steps, impelled by good intent,;kirkpatrick
2;9;5947;107;my leader drew me, saying: ‘Humbly ask;kirkpatrick
2;9;5948;108;that he undo the lock that holds the door.’;kirkpatrick
2;9;5949;109;I fell devoutly at his holy feet;kirkpatrick
2;9;5950;110;and asked that he, for mercy, open it.;kirkpatrick
2;9;5951;111;But, ﬁrst, three times I beat upon my breast.;kirkpatrick
2;9;5952;112;He then sketched seven ‘Ps’ across my brow,;kirkpatrick
2;9;5953;113;written with sword point. ‘When you’re once within, make;kirkpatrick
2;9;5954;114;sure,’ he said, ‘you go and wash these scars.’;kirkpatrick
2;9;5955;115;The vestments that he wore would be, in hue,;kirkpatrick
2;9;5956;116;the same as ash or soil when dug out dry.;kirkpatrick
2;9;5957;117;Then from beneath his robes he drew two keys.;kirkpatrick
2;9;5958;118;One key was silver and the other gold.;kirkpatrick
2;9;5959;119;With ﬁrst the white, then yellow after that,;kirkpatrick
2;9;5960;120;he worked the door so I was well content.;kirkpatrick
2;9;5961;121;‘Whenever either of these keys falls short;kirkpatrick
2;9;5962;122;and fails to turn correctly in its lock,;kirkpatrick
2;9;5963;123;this path,’ he said, ‘will not then open up.;kirkpatrick
2;9;5964;124;One is more precious, but the other needs;kirkpatrick
2;9;5965;125;much greater art and skill to make it turn.;kirkpatrick
2;9;5966;126;This is the one that gets the knot undone.;kirkpatrick
2;9;5967;127;From Peter I receive these keys – who said,;kirkpatrick
2;9;5968;128;when penitents have bowed down to my feet,;kirkpatrick
2;9;5969;129;“Err more in opening than in locking out.” ‘;kirkpatrick
2;9;5970;130;He pushed the panels of the sacred gate,;kirkpatrick
2;9;5971;131;saying: ‘Go in. But be aware of this,;kirkpatrick
2;9;5972;132;that those who look behind return outside.’;kirkpatrick
2;9;5973;133;And when the pivots of that sacred hall,;kirkpatrick
2;9;5974;134;forged out of resonantly massive steel,;kirkpatrick
2;9;5975;135;were wrenched around within their housing hinge,;kirkpatrick
2;9;5976;136;no roar was heard, no harsher sound was made,;kirkpatrick
2;9;5977;137;by Tarpeian doors, when from them honest;kirkpatrick
2;9;5978;138;Metellus was dragged – doors that were henceforth lean.;kirkpatrick
2;9;5979;139;I turned, attentive when the thunder broke,;kirkpatrick
2;9;5980;140;and, seemingly, ‘Te Deum laudamus’;kirkpatrick
2;9;5981;141;was heard, as voices mixed in that sweet tune.;kirkpatrick
2;9;5982;142;The sounds I heard brought back into my mind;kirkpatrick
2;9;5983;143;the same impression that we often get;kirkpatrick
2;9;5984;144;when organs play, accompanying a voice.;kirkpatrick
2;9;5985;145;"Now, yes, we hear the words; now, no, we don’t.";kirkpatrick
2;10;5986;1;Now, both within the threshold of that gate;kirkpatrick
2;10;5987;2;(our souls won’t use it, out of ill-bent love;kirkpatrick
2;10;5988;3;which makes the crooked way, to us, seem straight)  I;kirkpatrick
2;10;5989;4;heard it closed, resoundingly, again.;kirkpatrick
2;10;5990;5;Yet if I’d turned to set my eyes on that,;kirkpatrick
2;10;5991;6;what adequate excuse could there have been?;kirkpatrick
2;10;5992;7;We climbed now through a trough of ﬁssured rock;kirkpatrick
2;10;5993;8;that moved, on either side, this way and that,;kirkpatrick
2;10;5994;9;as waves do, surging near, then running back.;kirkpatrick
2;10;5995;10;‘We’ll need,’ my lord began, ‘a certain skill;kirkpatrick
2;10;5996;11;to keep together tight against the curve;kirkpatrick
2;10;5997;12;that, ebbing here and there, avoids the swell.’;kirkpatrick
2;10;5998;13;This made our footsteps few and hesitant.;kirkpatrick
2;10;5999;14;And so the moon, which now was on the wane,;kirkpatrick
2;10;6000;15;had reached its bed, to lie once more at rest,;kirkpatrick
2;10;6001;16;before we’d gone beyond that needle eye.;kirkpatrick
2;10;6002;17;But once we did get free and opened up,;kirkpatrick
2;10;6003;18;climbing to where the mountain gathered in –;kirkpatrick
2;10;6004;19;I all worn out and both of us unsure;kirkpatrick
2;10;6005;20;of where to make our way – we paused upon;kirkpatrick
2;10;6006;21;a road far lonelier than any desert track.;kirkpatrick
2;10;6007;22;If measured from the edge that marked the void,;kirkpatrick
2;10;6008;23;towards the foot of that still-soaring mount,;kirkpatrick
2;10;6009;24;the span would be three human body lengths.;kirkpatrick
2;10;6010;25;And, be it to the left side or the right,;kirkpatrick
2;10;6011;26;as far as eyesight could extend its wings,;kirkpatrick
2;10;6012;27;the ledge, in circuit, seemed to me the same.;kirkpatrick
2;10;6013;28;We’d still to move our feet towards those heights;kirkpatrick
2;10;6014;29;when I perceived that, all around, the bank –;kirkpatrick
2;10;6015;30;which, rising straight, lacked any upward route –  was;kirkpatrick
2;10;6016;31;marble, brilliant white, and all adorned;kirkpatrick
2;10;6017;32;with carved reliefs so ﬁne that Polyclite,;kirkpatrick
2;10;6018;33;or even Nature, would have there felt scorned.;kirkpatrick
2;10;6019;34;The angel, reaching earth with that decree;kirkpatrick
2;10;6020;35;of peace – so wept-for over centuries –;kirkpatrick
2;10;6021;36;which opened Heaven’s long-forbidden gates,;kirkpatrick
2;10;6022;37;appeared so truthfully before us now,;kirkpatrick
2;10;6023;38;carved in a gesture of pure gentleness,;kirkpatrick
2;10;6024;39;he did not seem an image keeping silence.;kirkpatrick
2;10;6025;40;In truth, one might have said he spoke the ‘Ave’ .;kirkpatrick
2;10;6026;41;For in that image was the one who turned;kirkpatrick
2;10;6027;42;the key that opened out the utmost Love.;kirkpatrick
2;10;6028;43;And from her stance and bearing there shone out;kirkpatrick
2;10;6029;44;(exactly as an imprint sealed in wax);kirkpatrick
2;10;6030;45;‘Ecce ancilla Dei’ , word for word.;kirkpatrick
2;10;6031;46;‘Don’t keep your mind ﬁxed only on one part.’;kirkpatrick
2;10;6032;47;These words my teacher gently spoke to me.;kirkpatrick
2;10;6033;48;(I held him where all others have their heart.);kirkpatrick
2;10;6034;49;And so, in sight, I moved. And I could see,;kirkpatrick
2;10;6035;50;behind Maria, on the side where he,;kirkpatrick
2;10;6036;51;in urging me to make a move, now stood,;kirkpatrick
2;10;6037;52;set in the rock, another narrative.;kirkpatrick
2;10;6038;53;Passing by Virgil, I came near to that,;kirkpatrick
2;10;6039;54;so that it stood displayed before my eyes.;kirkpatrick
2;10;6040;55;Carved there – in marble, also – was the cart,;kirkpatrick
2;10;6041;56;with oxen, carrying the Holy Ark;kirkpatrick
2;10;6042;57;(because of which we dread unsanctioned deeds).;kirkpatrick
2;10;6043;58;Before the Ark were people, as it seemed,;kirkpatrick
2;10;6044;59;gathered in seven choirs who made my sense –;kirkpatrick
2;10;6045;60;hearing and sight – say, ‘No’, and, ‘Yes, they sing.’;kirkpatrick
2;10;6046;61;In that same way, the incense smoke, which there;kirkpatrick
2;10;6047;62;was imaged, worked on eye and nose, so these;kirkpatrick
2;10;6048;63;were not concordant as to ‘no’ and ‘yes’.;kirkpatrick
2;10;6049;64;Before that vessel of all holiness,;kirkpatrick
2;10;6050;65;the humble psalmist danced, his robe tucked up – both;kirkpatrick
2;10;6051;66;more and less than king in all of this.;kirkpatrick
2;10;6052;67;Then Michal, opposite, was gazing down,;kirkpatrick
2;10;6053;68;as from some window of the royal court,;kirkpatrick
2;10;6054;69;an eﬃgy of rancour and disdain.;kirkpatrick
2;10;6055;70;I turned my feet away from where I’d stood;kirkpatrick
2;10;6056;71;to note another story, close at hand,;kirkpatrick
2;10;6057;72;its gleam beyond the ‘Michal’, showing white.;kirkpatrick
2;10;6058;73;En-storied here was found the glorious deed;kirkpatrick
2;10;6059;74;of that high prince of Rome whose prowess moved;kirkpatrick
2;10;6060;75;Pope Gregory to win great victory.;kirkpatrick
2;10;6061;76;I speak of Trajan, noble Emperor.;kirkpatrick
2;10;6062;77;A widow there had snatched his horse’s rein,;kirkpatrick
2;10;6063;78;her gestures those of grief and bitter tears.;kirkpatrick
2;10;6064;79;Around him, surging horsemen, as it seemed,;kirkpatrick
2;10;6065;80;ﬁlled all the space. And eagles, wrought in gold, were;kirkpatrick
2;10;6066;81;seen above, as moving in the wind.;kirkpatrick
2;10;6067;82;The wretched widow, as these thronged around,;kirkpatrick
2;10;6068;83;was saying, seemingly: ‘My lord, avenge;kirkpatrick
2;10;6069;84;my dearest son. He’s dead. That is my heart-wound!’;kirkpatrick
2;10;6070;85;He, seemingly, replied to her: ‘Just wait.;kirkpatrick
2;10;6071;86;I shall return.’ And she: ‘My lord’ – as though;kirkpatrick
2;10;6072;87;her agony were quickening all the more –;kirkpatrick
2;10;6073;88;‘but if you don’t return?’ And he: ‘The one;kirkpatrick
2;10;6074;89;who’s where I am will act.’ And she: ‘How can;kirkpatrick
2;10;6075;90;his good be yours when you forget your own?’;kirkpatrick
2;10;6076;91;Then he: ‘Be comforted. It’s right that I;kirkpatrick
2;10;6077;92;fulﬁl, before I move, what I should do.;kirkpatrick
2;10;6078;93;Justice demands this, and compassion binds.’;kirkpatrick
2;10;6079;94;The One who sees no thing that’s new to Him;kirkpatrick
2;10;6080;95;produced this form of discourse visible –;kirkpatrick
2;10;6081;96;so new to us, so fresh since not found here.;kirkpatrick
2;10;6082;97;While I, in all delight, still gazed upon;kirkpatrick
2;10;6083;98;these images of great humility,;kirkpatrick
2;10;6084;99;more precious being formed by that skilled hand.;kirkpatrick
2;10;6085;100;‘Look over here! Although their pace is slow,;kirkpatrick
2;10;6086;101;there are,’ the poet murmured, ‘people there,;kirkpatrick
2;10;6087;102;a crowd who’ll send us to the steps above.’;kirkpatrick
2;10;6088;103;My eyes, entranced in wonder, longingly,;kirkpatrick
2;10;6089;104;still seeking happily new things to see,;kirkpatrick
2;10;6090;105;turned round towards him, making no delay.;kirkpatrick
2;10;6091;106;Yet, reader, I’d not have your minds bewitched,;kirkpatrick
2;10;6092;107;hearing how God would have the debt repaid,;kirkpatrick
2;10;6093;108;or drawn away from your best purposes.;kirkpatrick
2;10;6094;109;Don’t dwell upon the form their suﬀerings take.;kirkpatrick
2;10;6095;110;Think of what follows, and that, come the worst, it can’t;kirkpatrick
2;10;6096;111;go on beyond the Judgement Day.;kirkpatrick
2;10;6097;112;‘Sir,’ I began, ‘it seems that what I see,;kirkpatrick
2;10;6098;113;moving towards us, are not human forms.;kirkpatrick
2;10;6099;114;I cannot tell. I rave. I look in vain.’;kirkpatrick
2;10;6100;115;‘Their grievous mode of punishment’ (to me);kirkpatrick
2;10;6101;116;‘so creases them and bends them to the ground;kirkpatrick
2;10;6102;117;that my eyes, too, ﬁrst fought at what they see.;kirkpatrick
2;10;6103;118;Look, though, and ﬁx your gaze. Let sight untwist;kirkpatrick
2;10;6104;119;the vines of what comes there beneath these stones.;kirkpatrick
2;10;6105;120;You see already how each beats his breast.’;kirkpatrick
2;10;6106;121;Proud Christians, wretched and – alas! – so tired,;kirkpatrick
2;10;6107;122;who, feeble in your powers of mental sight,;kirkpatrick
2;10;6108;123;place so much faith in your own backward tread,;kirkpatrick
2;10;6109;124;do you not recognize that you are worms;kirkpatrick
2;10;6110;125;born to become angelic butterﬂies;kirkpatrick
2;10;6111;126;that ﬂy to justice with no veil between?;kirkpatrick
2;10;6112;127;Why is it that your thoughts ﬂoat up so high?;kirkpatrick
2;10;6113;128;You, with your faults, are little more than grubs,;kirkpatrick
2;10;6114;129;chrysalides (no more!) that lack full form.;kirkpatrick
2;10;6115;130;As sometimes, bracing up a roof or vault,;kirkpatrick
2;10;6116;131;a ﬁgure will be seen as corbel stone;kirkpatrick
2;10;6117;132;that, bending, joins its two knees to its chest,  at;kirkpatrick
2;10;6118;133;which there’s born, in anyone who sees,;kirkpatrick
2;10;6119;134;from this non-truth a truly harsh distress:;kirkpatrick
2;10;6120;135;that’s how I saw them when I gave them thought.;kirkpatrick
2;10;6121;136;The truth is each was hunched up, less and more,;kirkpatrick
2;10;6122;137;according to his load, some more, some less.;kirkpatrick
2;10;6123;138;The one who, from his actions, bore the most,;kirkpatrick
2;10;6124;139;appeared in tears to pant: ‘I can’t do more.’;kirkpatrick
2;11;6125;1;‘Our Father, dwelling in the heavenly spheres,;kirkpatrick
2;11;6126;2;not circumscribed by these but through that love;kirkpatrick
2;11;6127;3;which you bear more, on high, to primal things,;kirkpatrick
2;11;6128;4;Your name, and all the prowess of your might,;kirkpatrick
2;11;6129;5;be praised by every creature. It is ﬁt;kirkpatrick
2;11;6130;6;to pay all thanks to Your sweet forming power.;kirkpatrick
2;11;6131;7;May peace, as in Your realm, come down to us.;kirkpatrick
2;11;6132;8;For we ourselves cannot attain to that,;kirkpatrick
2;11;6133;9;if come it doesn’t – not with all our wit.;kirkpatrick
2;11;6134;10;As all your angels make a sacriﬁce,;kirkpatrick
2;11;6135;11;singing “Osanna” , of their wills to you,;kirkpatrick
2;11;6136;12;so, too, may men make sacriﬁce of theirs.;kirkpatrick
2;11;6137;13;Give us this day the manna each day needs.;kirkpatrick
2;11;6138;14;Without that, exiled in this grinding waste,;kirkpatrick
2;11;6139;15;all travel backwards who strive forwards most.;kirkpatrick
2;11;6140;16;And just as we, to everyone, forgive;kirkpatrick
2;11;6141;17;the harm we bear, grant generous pardon, too.;kirkpatrick
2;11;6142;18;And do not look upon what we deserve.;kirkpatrick
2;11;6143;19;The powers we have (so easily subdued);kirkpatrick
2;11;6144;20;do not make trial of through the ancient foe,;kirkpatrick
2;11;6145;21;but free us from the one who is our goad.;kirkpatrick
2;11;6146;22;This ﬁnal prayer is made, O dearest Lord,;kirkpatrick
2;11;6147;23;not for ourselves (we now have no such need).;kirkpatrick
2;11;6148;24;We speak for those behind us, who’ve remained.’;kirkpatrick
2;11;6149;25;Then praying, for themselves and us, ‘God speed’,;kirkpatrick
2;11;6150;26;these shadows made their way beneath such loads;kirkpatrick
2;11;6151;27;as sometimes in our nightmares can be seen,;kirkpatrick
2;11;6152;28;around and all around on that ﬁrst ledge,;kirkpatrick
2;11;6153;29;worn-out, tormented (though each diﬀerently),;kirkpatrick
2;11;6154;30;purging away the murky fogs of earth.;kirkpatrick
2;11;6155;31;If they, in that place, always speak our good,;kirkpatrick
2;11;6156;32;down here what can be said and done for them,;kirkpatrick
2;11;6157;33;by those whose wills are good in where they root?;kirkpatrick
2;11;6158;34;We surely ought to help them cleanse the marks;kirkpatrick
2;11;6159;35;that they bore hence – till, light in weight and pure,;kirkpatrick
2;11;6160;36;they’ve power to rise towards the wheeling stars.;kirkpatrick
2;11;6161;37;‘May justice and compassion soon relieve;kirkpatrick
2;11;6162;38;this weight from you, so you may move your wings,;kirkpatrick
2;11;6163;39;which then, as you desire, may lighten you!;kirkpatrick
2;11;6164;40;So, too, point out to us, to left or right,;kirkpatrick
2;11;6165;41;the shortest way to go towards the stair.;kirkpatrick
2;11;6166;42;If more than one, teach us the least steep slope.;kirkpatrick
2;11;6167;43;For this man here who comes along with me,;kirkpatrick
2;11;6168;44;burdened in being clothed with Adam’s ﬂesh,;kirkpatrick
2;11;6169;45;is loath to climb, despite the will to do.’;kirkpatrick
2;11;6170;46;The words that came, responding now to those;kirkpatrick
2;11;6171;47;that he whom I was following ﬁrst spoke,;kirkpatrick
2;11;6172;48;rose from some source not clearly manifest.;kirkpatrick
2;11;6173;49;But this was said: ‘Turn right, and come with us;kirkpatrick
2;11;6174;50;along the bank. You’ll ﬁnd an upward path;kirkpatrick
2;11;6175;51;where even living persons can ascend.;kirkpatrick
2;11;6176;52;And were I not impeded by this stone;kirkpatrick
2;11;6177;53;that tames the hauteur of my once-proud neck –;kirkpatrick
2;11;6178;54;so I am bound to keep my head held low –;kirkpatrick
2;11;6179;55;I’d raise my eyes to look at this man here –;kirkpatrick
2;11;6180;56;alive still, though unnamed – in case I knew him,;kirkpatrick
2;11;6181;57;and make him look in pity on my load.;kirkpatrick
2;11;6182;58;I was Italian, bred of Tuscan stock.;kirkpatrick
2;11;6183;59;Aldobrandesco was my noble sire.;kirkpatrick
2;11;6184;60;I don’t know if his name was known to you.;kirkpatrick
2;11;6185;61;The ancient lineage and courtly airs;kirkpatrick
2;11;6186;62;of my great forebears wrought such pride in me;kirkpatrick
2;11;6187;63;that, heedless of the mother we all share,;kirkpatrick
2;11;6188;64;I so disdained all other men, I died;kirkpatrick
2;11;6189;65;because of that. The Sienese know this,;kirkpatrick
2;11;6190;66;as do the squads in Campagnatico.;kirkpatrick
2;11;6191;67;I am Omberto, and my arrogance;kirkpatrick
2;11;6192;68;did harm to me, but not to me alone,;kirkpatrick
2;11;6193;69;for all my peers were victims of that bane.;kirkpatrick
2;11;6194;70;Because of this, till God is satisﬁed,;kirkpatrick
2;11;6195;71;I needs must bear this weight among the dead –;kirkpatrick
2;11;6196;72;since I did not while still with those who live.’;kirkpatrick
2;11;6197;73;Still listening, I had kept my face bowed low.;kirkpatrick
2;11;6198;74;And one of them – not he who spoke these words –;kirkpatrick
2;11;6199;75;twisted beneath the load that bore him down.;kirkpatrick
2;11;6200;76;He saw and recognized, then called to me,;kirkpatrick
2;11;6201;77;holding his eyes, with eﬀort, ﬁrmly ﬁxed;kirkpatrick
2;11;6202;78;on me, bowed down, who went along with him.;kirkpatrick
2;11;6203;79;‘Oh! Aren’t you Oderisi?’ I replied.;kirkpatrick
2;11;6204;80;‘Great Gubbio’s glory, glory of that art,;kirkpatrick
2;11;6205;81;known to Parisians as design-in-light?’;kirkpatrick
2;11;6206;82;‘Dear man,’ he said, ‘those pages smile far more;kirkpatrick
2;11;6207;83;that Franco Bolognese smoothly pens.;kirkpatrick
2;11;6208;84;The honour is all his – and, partly, mine.;kirkpatrick
2;11;6209;85;Yet while I lived, I’d not, you may be sure,;kirkpatrick
2;11;6210;86;have shown such courtesy. My heart’s desire;kirkpatrick
2;11;6211;87;was excellence. I yearned for that alone.;kirkpatrick
2;11;6212;88;For arrogance like this one pays a fee.;kirkpatrick
2;11;6213;89;And I’d still not be here if I had not,;kirkpatrick
2;11;6214;90;while having power to sin, turned back to God.;kirkpatrick
2;11;6215;91;Oh, what vainglorying in human powers!;kirkpatrick
2;11;6216;92;How short a time the green lasts on the height;kirkpatrick
2;11;6217;93;unless some cruder, darker age succeeds.;kirkpatrick
2;11;6218;94;Once, as a painter, Cimabue thought;kirkpatrick
2;11;6219;95;he took the prize. Now “Giotto”’s on all lips;kirkpatrick
2;11;6220;96;and Cimabue’s fame is quite eclipsed.;kirkpatrick
2;11;6221;97;In verse, as well, a second Guido steals;kirkpatrick
2;11;6222;98;all glory from the ﬁrst. And someone’s born,;kirkpatrick
2;11;6223;99;who’ll thrust, perhaps, both Guidos from the nest.;kirkpatrick
2;11;6224;100;The roar of earthly fame is just a breath;kirkpatrick
2;11;6225;101;of wind, blowing from here and then from there,;kirkpatrick
2;11;6226;102;that changes name in changing origin.;kirkpatrick
2;11;6227;103;What more renown will you have if you strip;kirkpatrick
2;11;6228;104;your ﬂesh in age away than if you died;kirkpatrick
2;11;6229;105;before you’d left oﬀ lisping “Din-dins!”, “Penth!”;kirkpatrick
2;11;6230;106;when once a thousand years have passed, a space;kirkpatrick
2;11;6231;107;that falls far short of all eternity –;kirkpatrick
2;11;6232;108;an eye blink to the slowest turning sphere.;kirkpatrick
2;11;6233;109;He who, ahead of me, takes such brief strides;kirkpatrick
2;11;6234;110;is one with whom all Tuscany once rang.;kirkpatrick
2;11;6235;111;His name’s now scarcely whispered in Siena,;kirkpatrick
2;11;6236;112;where he was Lord when Florence, running wild –;kirkpatrick
2;11;6237;113;as proud at that time as it’s whorelike now –;kirkpatrick
2;11;6238;114;was left destroyed and ravaged by the war.;kirkpatrick
2;11;6239;115;All your renown is coloured like the grass,;kirkpatrick
2;11;6240;116;which comes then goes. And He discolours it;kirkpatrick
2;11;6241;117;who made it ﬁrst appear from bitter earth.’;kirkpatrick
2;11;6242;118;And I to him: ‘Your words in truth give heart;kirkpatrick
2;11;6243;119;to good humility, and puncture pride.;kirkpatrick
2;11;6244;120;But who’s this man of whom you spoke just now?’;kirkpatrick
2;11;6245;121;‘Provenzan Salvani’ (the answer was).;kirkpatrick
2;11;6246;122;‘And he is here because he proudly claimed;kirkpatrick
2;11;6247;123;to hold Siena wholly in his hands.;kirkpatrick
2;11;6248;124;And since his death, he’s walked as now he walks,;kirkpatrick
2;11;6249;125;without repose. Like all who down there dared,;kirkpatrick
2;11;6250;126;he pays his debts in full with such-like cash.’;kirkpatrick
2;11;6251;127;And I: ‘If any spirit who delays;kirkpatrick
2;11;6252;128;repentance to life’s ﬁnal verge is bound;kirkpatrick
2;11;6253;129;to dwell below the gate and not ascend;kirkpatrick
2;11;6254;130;(unless good prayers on his behalf bring aid);kirkpatrick
2;11;6255;131;until it’s passed as much time as it lived,;kirkpatrick
2;11;6256;132;how was it granted him that he should come?’;kirkpatrick
2;11;6257;133;‘When he could boast, in life, most glorious fame,;kirkpatrick
2;11;6258;134;freely he took a stand,’ the answer was,;kirkpatrick
2;11;6259;135;‘in Campo di Siena, free from shame,;kirkpatrick
2;11;6260;136;and there, to save his friend the punishment –;kirkpatrick
2;11;6261;137;incurred in his imprisonment to Charles –;kirkpatrick
2;11;6262;138;he brought himself to tremble through each vein.;kirkpatrick
2;11;6263;139;I’ll say no more (I know I speak dark words,;kirkpatrick
2;11;6264;140;but little time will pass till those near you;kirkpatrick
2;11;6265;141;will act in ways that mean you can explain).;kirkpatrick
2;11;6266;142;Provenzan’s deed removed him from those bounds.’;kirkpatrick
2;12;6267;1;Paired up, like oxen yoked to move as one,;kirkpatrick
2;12;6268;2;so onward with that burdened soul I went,;kirkpatrick
2;12;6269;3;as long as he – my dear, kind sir – allowed.;kirkpatrick
2;12;6270;4;But then he said: ‘Leave him and go beyond.;kirkpatrick
2;12;6271;5;The best thing is that each here drives along;kirkpatrick
2;12;6272;6;his craft, by oar or sail, as best he can.’;kirkpatrick
2;12;6273;7;I made myself (as, walking, one must do);kirkpatrick
2;12;6274;8;in person stand up straight. And yet my thoughts;kirkpatrick
2;12;6275;9;remained in me stripped bare, reduced, bowed low.;kirkpatrick
2;12;6276;10;I’d now moved on, and followed willingly;kirkpatrick
2;12;6277;11;the footsteps of my teacher. And we two;kirkpatrick
2;12;6278;12;already showed in tread how light we were.;kirkpatrick
2;12;6279;13;And then he said: ‘Just turn your eyes down there.;kirkpatrick
2;12;6280;14;That will be good for you, to ease the way.;kirkpatrick
2;12;6281;15;See there the bed on which your paces rest.’;kirkpatrick
2;12;6282;16;Compare: to serve as some memorial;kirkpatrick
2;12;6283;17;for those entombed beneath, our earthly graves;kirkpatrick
2;12;6284;18;bear signs of what they had been when alive –;kirkpatrick
2;12;6285;19;at which it often happens that we weep,;kirkpatrick
2;12;6286;20;responding to the spur of memories;kirkpatrick
2;12;6287;21;which only strike the heel of pious minds.;kirkpatrick
2;12;6288;22;I now saw carvings there – though ﬁner, far,;kirkpatrick
2;12;6289;23;considering the hand that crafted them –;kirkpatrick
2;12;6290;24;along the path the mountain cliﬀs had left.;kirkpatrick
2;12;6291;25;M ark now, to this side I here saw the one;kirkpatrick
2;12;6292;26;nobler-created than all creatures else,;kirkpatrick
2;12;6293;27;thrown down in ﬂashing thunder ﬁre from Heaven.;kirkpatrick
2;12;6294;28;M ark this, I witnessed on the other side,;kirkpatrick
2;12;6295;29;pierced by the spear celestial, Briareus,;kirkpatrick
2;12;6296;30;heavy on earth, laid low in deathly chill.;kirkpatrick
2;12;6297;31;M ark this, I saw Timbreus, still in arms,;kirkpatrick
2;12;6298;32;and Mars and Pallas round their father’s side,;kirkpatrick
2;12;6299;33;amazed to see the scattered Giantbones.;kirkpatrick
2;12;6300;34;M ark this, I saw, beneath the tower he’d made,;kirkpatrick
2;12;6301;35;Nimrod, as in confusion. All the tribe;kirkpatrick
2;12;6302;36;of Shinar – arrogant as he – gazed on.;kirkpatrick
2;12;6303;37;A h! Niobe I saw. With grieving eyes,;kirkpatrick
2;12;6304;38;I traced your outline carved within that road,;kirkpatrick
2;12;6305;39;among your children – seven, then seven – slain.;kirkpatrick
2;12;6306;40;A h! Saul, it seemed that you were there, as dead,;kirkpatrick
2;12;6307;41;pierced on Gilboa’s hill with your own sword,;kirkpatrick
2;12;6308;42;feeling no longer showers of rain or dew.;kirkpatrick
2;12;6309;43;A h! Mad Arachne, how I saw you there;kirkpatrick
2;12;6310;44;half-turned to spider and the work in shreds;kirkpatrick
2;12;6311;45;which, once attempted, brought you so much harm.;kirkpatrick
2;12;6312;46;A h! Rehoboam, as you’re there portrayed,;kirkpatrick
2;12;6313;47;you’re not, now, menacing, but full of dread.;kirkpatrick
2;12;6314;48;A chariot bears you oﬀ, though none gives chase.;kirkpatrick
2;12;6315;49;N ow also shown on that hard ﬂoor was how;kirkpatrick
2;12;6316;50;Alcmaeon made the fatal ornament;kirkpatrick
2;12;6317;51;that cost his treacherous mother very dear.;kirkpatrick
2;12;6318;52;N ow was displayed how Sennacherib’s sons;kirkpatrick
2;12;6319;53;ﬂung themselves at him in the temple hall,;kirkpatrick
2;12;6320;54;and how, once dead, they left him there alone.;kirkpatrick
2;12;6321;55;N ow there appeared the chaos, crude and cruel,;kirkpatrick
2;12;6322;56;wrought by Thamyris, who to Cyrus said:;kirkpatrick
2;12;6323;57;‘You thirst for blood. With blood I’ll feed you full!’;kirkpatrick
2;12;6324;58;N ow, ﬂeeing, the Assyrians were shown –;kirkpatrick
2;12;6325;59;routed when Holofernes met his death –;kirkpatrick
2;12;6326;60;and showed the relics of his mortal pain.;kirkpatrick
2;12;6327;61;M ark this, I saw Troy’s ash and hollowed stone.;kirkpatrick
2;12;6328;62;A h, Ilion! How humbled and how vile,;kirkpatrick
2;12;6329;63;n ow picked out in those signs, you seemed to be!;kirkpatrick
2;12;6330;64;What master of the pencil or the brush;kirkpatrick
2;12;6331;65;could reproduce those shadows and those strokes;kirkpatrick
2;12;6332;66;which, there, would make the sharpest mind admire?;kirkpatrick
2;12;6333;67;The dead seemed dead, the living seemed alive.;kirkpatrick
2;12;6334;68;And all I trod upon – bowed low – I saw;kirkpatrick
2;12;6335;69;far truer than had those who’d seen it true.;kirkpatrick
2;12;6336;70;Strut on, you sons of Eve, with head held high.;kirkpatrick
2;12;6337;71;Display your pride, and do not bend your face;kirkpatrick
2;12;6338;72;to see the errors of your evil way!;kirkpatrick
2;12;6339;73;We’d made more distance round the mountainside;kirkpatrick
2;12;6340;74;(spending more time than mind, still bound, supposed, in;kirkpatrick
2;12;6341;75;following the track the sun observes);kirkpatrick
2;12;6342;76;when he – who always kept his mind ahead –;kirkpatrick
2;12;6343;77;began: ‘Now straighten up, and lift your brows.;kirkpatrick
2;12;6344;78;The moment’s passed to go caught up like this.;kirkpatrick
2;12;6345;79;See? Over there! An angel quickens pace.;kirkpatrick
2;12;6346;80;It comes our way. Come! See! See, too, the hour, sixth;kirkpatrick
2;12;6347;81;handmaid of the day, already turns.;kirkpatrick
2;12;6348;82;Adorn your eyes and acts with reverence,;kirkpatrick
2;12;6349;83;so he, to his delight, may speed our climb.;kirkpatrick
2;12;6350;84;Think! This same day will never dawn again.’;kirkpatrick
2;12;6351;85;I was well used to his admonishments –;kirkpatrick
2;12;6352;86;always ‘to waste no time’. So, as to that,;kirkpatrick
2;12;6353;87;the words he spoke could hardly be obscure.;kirkpatrick
2;12;6354;88;To us that lovely creature now advanced,;kirkpatrick
2;12;6355;89;white-vestitured, in countenance, it seems,;kirkpatrick
2;12;6356;90;trembling in air as does the morning star.;kirkpatrick
2;12;6357;91;Opening his arms, then opening his wings,;kirkpatrick
2;12;6358;92;he said: ‘Now come. The steps are very near,;kirkpatrick
2;12;6359;93;and now the climb could not be easier.;kirkpatrick
2;12;6360;94;Men, though invited, come too rarely here.;kirkpatrick
2;12;6361;95;O human nature! You are born to ﬂy!;kirkpatrick
2;12;6362;96;Why fail and fall at, merely, puﬀs of wind?’;kirkpatrick
2;12;6363;97;He led us where the cleft was in the rock.;kirkpatrick
2;12;6364;98;And here he struck his wings across my brow,;kirkpatrick
2;12;6365;99;then promised me the way ahead was safe.;kirkpatrick
2;12;6366;100;Compare: to scale the hill towards that church;kirkpatrick
2;12;6367;101;which dominates the city (so well-ruled!);kirkpatrick
2;12;6368;102;that stands around the Rubaconte bridge,;kirkpatrick
2;12;6369;103;rightwards the vaunting angle of the climb;kirkpatrick
2;12;6370;104;is broken by a stairway built in times;kirkpatrick
2;12;6371;105;when chronicles and balances were true.;kirkpatrick
2;12;6372;106;Like this, the bank which falls so steeply here;kirkpatrick
2;12;6373;107;from where the next ring stands was gradual,;kirkpatrick
2;12;6374;108;though all around the high rock shaved its sides.;kirkpatrick
2;12;6375;109;While turning (we two persons) to that slope;kirkpatrick
2;12;6376;110;voices sang out: ‘Beati pauperes’ ,;kirkpatrick
2;12;6377;111;as no mere speech could properly relate.;kirkpatrick
2;12;6378;112;How diﬀerent from the thoroughfares of Hell;kirkpatrick
2;12;6379;113;are those through which we passed. For here with songs;kirkpatrick
2;12;6380;114;we enter, there with ﬁerce lamentations.;kirkpatrick
2;12;6381;115;We were, by now, ascending that great stair.;kirkpatrick
2;12;6382;116;And I, it seemed, was lighter now by far;kirkpatrick
2;12;6383;117;than I had seemed while still on level ground.;kirkpatrick
2;12;6384;118;So, ‘Tell me, sir,’ I said, ‘what weight has now;kirkpatrick
2;12;6385;119;been lifted from me, so I almost feel;kirkpatrick
2;12;6386;120;no strain at all in walking on my way?’;kirkpatrick
2;12;6387;121;He answered: ‘When the “P”s that mark your brow,;kirkpatrick
2;12;6388;122;remaining still, though growing now more faint,;kirkpatrick
2;12;6389;123;have all (as is the ﬁrst) been sheared away,;kirkpatrick
2;12;6390;124;your steps will then be conquered by good will;kirkpatrick
2;12;6391;125;and, being thus impelled towards the heights,;kirkpatrick
2;12;6392;126;will feel no strain but only sheer delight.’;kirkpatrick
2;12;6393;127;And then I did what anyone would do;kirkpatrick
2;12;6394;128;with something on their head – they can’t tell what – but,;kirkpatrick
2;12;6395;129;seeing people point, peer up suspiciously,;kirkpatrick
2;12;6396;130;then raise a hand to help them be quite sure,;kirkpatrick
2;12;6397;131;to search around, to ﬁnd and do the job;kirkpatrick
2;12;6398;132;that sight had been unable to complete.;kirkpatrick
2;12;6399;133;So now my right-hand ﬁngers found reduced;kirkpatrick
2;12;6400;134;the letters there inscribed to merely six;kirkpatrick
2;12;6401;135;of those the angel with the keys had cut.;kirkpatrick
2;12;6402;136;My leader, watching as I did so, smiled.;kirkpatrick
2;13;6403;1;We now were at the summit of the stair.;kirkpatrick
2;13;6404;2;The mountain there – which, as one climbs, takes ill away;kirkpatrick
2;13;6405;3;– is chiselled back a second time.;kirkpatrick
2;13;6406;4;And so there’s, here, a ledge around the slope,;kirkpatrick
2;13;6407;5;which binds it, as the ﬁrst ledge also did,;kirkpatrick
2;13;6408;6;except that now the arc curves faster in.;kirkpatrick
2;13;6409;7;Shade? There’s none here, nor any sign to see.;kirkpatrick
2;13;6410;8;The cliﬀs show bare. The path looks shorn of marks, save;kirkpatrick
2;13;6411;9;only for its stones of liverish blue.;kirkpatrick
2;13;6412;10;‘I fear,’ the poet said, considering this,;kirkpatrick
2;13;6413;11;‘our choice of route may well be long delayed;kirkpatrick
2;13;6414;12;if we wait here for someone we can ask.’;kirkpatrick
2;13;6415;13;Firmly, he ﬁxed his eyes towards the sun.;kirkpatrick
2;13;6416;14;He made a fulcrum of his right-hand side,;kirkpatrick
2;13;6417;15;and moved his left around that central point.;kirkpatrick
2;13;6418;16;‘You, sweetest light, in trusting you I now,’;kirkpatrick
2;13;6419;17;he said, ‘embark upon this strange new road.;kirkpatrick
2;13;6420;18;Guide us, as guidance must be here required.;kirkpatrick
2;13;6421;19;You warm the world. You shine out over it.;kirkpatrick
2;13;6422;20;Your rays, where counter reasons have no weight,;kirkpatrick
2;13;6423;21;must always lead with their authority.’;kirkpatrick
2;13;6424;22;The distance of a mile (as earth miles count);kirkpatrick
2;13;6425;23;we travelled now from where we’d been before –;kirkpatrick
2;13;6426;24;our will so quick – in little time at all.;kirkpatrick
2;13;6427;25;Then, unseen, ﬂying towards us now were heard;kirkpatrick
2;13;6428;26;the voices of spirits, all delivering;kirkpatrick
2;13;6429;27;a courteous welcome to the feast of love.;kirkpatrick
2;13;6430;28;The ﬁrst voice, ﬂeeting past, declared aloud,;kirkpatrick
2;13;6431;29;‘Vinum non habent!’ (‘Look, they have no wine!’),;kirkpatrick
2;13;6432;30;and then went on behind us, echoing that.;kirkpatrick
2;13;6433;31;And then, before it wholly was not heard,;kirkpatrick
2;13;6434;32;so distancing, another voice went by,;kirkpatrick
2;13;6435;33;declared, ‘I’m Orestes!’ and did not stay.;kirkpatrick
2;13;6436;34;‘Father,’ I said, ‘what voices can these be?’;kirkpatrick
2;13;6437;35;And, as I asked, there came – just look! – a third, saying:;kirkpatrick
2;13;6438;36;‘Love those by whom you suﬀer harm.’;kirkpatrick
2;13;6439;37;‘This conﬁne scourges,’ my good teacher said,;kirkpatrick
2;13;6440;38;‘the sin of envious hate. And so the skeins;kirkpatrick
2;13;6441;39;that form the stinging lash vibrate with love.;kirkpatrick
2;13;6442;40;The bridle will elicit diﬀerent notes.;kirkpatrick
2;13;6443;41;And these, I think, as far as I can tell,;kirkpatrick
2;13;6444;42;you’ll hear before you reach the pardon-pass.;kirkpatrick
2;13;6445;43;But ﬁx your eyes intently through the air.;kirkpatrick
2;13;6446;44;You’ll see some people sitting there ahead,;kirkpatrick
2;13;6447;45;each in their place along the mountain wall.’;kirkpatrick
2;13;6448;46;My eyes far wider than before, I looked;kirkpatrick
2;13;6449;47;and saw in front of us a group of shades,;kirkpatrick
2;13;6450;48;their cloaks in hue no diﬀerent from the rock.;kirkpatrick
2;13;6451;49;And when we were a little further on,;kirkpatrick
2;13;6452;50;I heard them calling: ‘Mary, pray for us.’;kirkpatrick
2;13;6453;51;‘Michael!’ they cried. ‘Saint Peter! All the saints!’;kirkpatrick
2;13;6454;52;I can’t believe that anyone on earth;kirkpatrick
2;13;6455;53;could be so hard that pity, at the sight;kirkpatrick
2;13;6456;54;that I saw now, would not have pierced him through.;kirkpatrick
2;13;6457;55;For when at last I’d come up close to them,;kirkpatrick
2;13;6458;56;and saw for certain what these people did,;kirkpatrick
2;13;6459;57;I spurted from my eyes the milk of grief.;kirkpatrick
2;13;6460;58;A poor hair shirt appeared to blanket each.;kirkpatrick
2;13;6461;59;Each let the other lean against his side,;kirkpatrick
2;13;6462;60;and all were let to lean against the cliﬀ.;kirkpatrick
2;13;6463;61;In that same way, the blind, for lack of things,;kirkpatrick
2;13;6464;62;stand begging for their needs on Pardon Days,;kirkpatrick
2;13;6465;63;the head of one bent low above the next,;kirkpatrick
2;13;6466;64;to gain from others pity for their plight;kirkpatrick
2;13;6467;65;not only through the sound of their sad words;kirkpatrick
2;13;6468;66;but also through the sight, which ached no less.;kirkpatrick
2;13;6469;67;And as the sun grants nothing to the blind,;kirkpatrick
2;13;6470;68;so, to the shadows that I speak of now,;kirkpatrick
2;13;6471;69;the light of heaven bestowed no generous ray.;kirkpatrick
2;13;6472;70;For all their eyelids, pierced by iron wires,;kirkpatrick
2;13;6473;71;were sewn up like an untamed sparrow hawk’s;kirkpatrick
2;13;6474;72;when, restively, it won’t keep calm and still.;kirkpatrick
2;13;6475;73;To me, it seemed an outrage to walk by;kirkpatrick
2;13;6476;74;seeing those others who did not see me.;kirkpatrick
2;13;6477;75;And so I turned to where wise counsels were.;kirkpatrick
2;13;6478;76;He knew full well what, mute, I meant to say.;kirkpatrick
2;13;6479;77;And so he did not wait to hear my words.;kirkpatrick
2;13;6480;78;‘Speak out,’ he said, ‘but brieﬂy, to the point.’;kirkpatrick
2;13;6481;79;Virgil beside me took the outer strip;kirkpatrick
2;13;6482;80;(where, since there is no verge to garland it,;kirkpatrick
2;13;6483;81;one might too easily have tumbled down);kirkpatrick
2;13;6484;82;while, on my other side, in constant prayer,;kirkpatrick
2;13;6485;83;were shadows who, through dreadful sutures, squeezed a;kirkpatrick
2;13;6486;84;press of tears to rinse and bathe their cheeks.;kirkpatrick
2;13;6487;85;To these I turned. ‘You, who are conﬁdent,’;kirkpatrick
2;13;6488;86;so I began, ‘to see the Light Supreme –;kirkpatrick
2;13;6489;87;which your desires are set upon alone –;kirkpatrick
2;13;6490;88;may grace soon clarify the scum that blurs;kirkpatrick
2;13;6491;89;your consciences, and let the streams of mind descend –;kirkpatrick
2;13;6492;90;with all of memory’s power – through you once more.;kirkpatrick
2;13;6493;91;Tell me – I’d hold your answer very dear –;kirkpatrick
2;13;6494;92;if any soul among you is Italian.;kirkpatrick
2;13;6495;93;It may, if I hear that, go well for him.’;kirkpatrick
2;13;6496;94;‘We are, dear brother, now all citizens;kirkpatrick
2;13;6497;95;of one true place. But you must mean:;kirkpatrick
2;13;6498;96;“…who winged his pilgrim life through Italy”.’;kirkpatrick
2;13;6499;97;This, in reply, I seemed to hear proceed;kirkpatrick
2;13;6500;98;from somewhere just ahead of where I stood.;kirkpatrick
2;13;6501;99;So further on I made my voice be heard.;kirkpatrick
2;13;6502;100;Among the rest, I saw a shadow seem;kirkpatrick
2;13;6503;101;to wait as though to say to me, ‘Well, how?’;kirkpatrick
2;13;6504;102;tilting its chin up as the sightless do.;kirkpatrick
2;13;6505;103;‘Spirit,’ I said, ‘you train yourself to rise.;kirkpatrick
2;13;6506;104;If you’re the one who just replied to me,;kirkpatrick
2;13;6507;105;then make it known. Tell me your name and place.’;kirkpatrick
2;13;6508;106;‘I’ (so the answer came) ‘was Sienese,;kirkpatrick
2;13;6509;107;and here repair the wicked life I led,;kirkpatrick
2;13;6510;108;weeping so He will grant Himself to us.;kirkpatrick
2;13;6511;109;Sapia (though not sapient) I was called.;kirkpatrick
2;13;6512;110;And I, to witness other people’s harm,;kirkpatrick
2;13;6513;111;felt joy far more than at my own good luck.;kirkpatrick
2;13;6514;112;Listen. Don’t think that this is mere deceit.;kirkpatrick
2;13;6515;113;Was I (then sinking down my arc of years);kirkpatrick
2;13;6516;114;as crazy as I’ve said I was, or not?;kirkpatrick
2;13;6517;115;My fellow Sienese near Colle cliﬀ;kirkpatrick
2;13;6518;116;were joined in battle with their enemies.;kirkpatrick
2;13;6519;117;And God, I prayed, would do what He then did.;kirkpatrick
2;13;6520;118;Routed here, shattered, they’d turned in bitter;kirkpatrick
2;13;6521;119;footfalls of ﬂight. And, seeing them hunted,;kirkpatrick
2;13;6522;120;sheer happiness seized me, beyond compare,;kirkpatrick
2;13;6523;121;so great I turned my reckless face on high,;kirkpatrick
2;13;6524;122;yelling at God: “I’ll fear you never more!” –;kirkpatrick
2;13;6525;123;just like the blackbird in a sunny spell.;kirkpatrick
2;13;6526;124;Then, coming to the utmost edge of life,;kirkpatrick
2;13;6527;125;I sought my peace with God. And even now,;kirkpatrick
2;13;6528;126;my dues would not, in penance, have been paid;kirkpatrick
2;13;6529;127;had I not been remembered in the prayers;kirkpatrick
2;13;6530;128;that Peter Pettinaio so devoutly made;kirkpatrick
2;13;6531;129;in heartfelt charity on my behalf.;kirkpatrick
2;13;6532;130;But who are you, to make your way round here;kirkpatrick
2;13;6533;131;inquiring as to us – with, still, I’m sure,;kirkpatrick
2;13;6534;132;your eyes unbound, and breathing when you speak?’;kirkpatrick
2;13;6535;133;‘My eyes,’ I said, ‘will only brieﬂy here;kirkpatrick
2;13;6536;134;be taken from me. For the harm is small;kirkpatrick
2;13;6537;135;that they, pursuing envy, might have done.;kirkpatrick
2;13;6538;136;Far greater fear holds sway within my soul;kirkpatrick
2;13;6539;137;of tortures suﬀered on the ridge below.;kirkpatrick
2;13;6540;138;The burdens of that place already press.’;kirkpatrick
2;13;6541;139;And she: ‘Who, then, has led you up to us,;kirkpatrick
2;13;6542;140;when you are certain that you’ll head back down?’;kirkpatrick
2;13;6543;141;‘This one,’ I said, ‘with me, who speaks no word.;kirkpatrick
2;13;6544;142;I am alive. And so please ask of me,;kirkpatrick
2;13;6545;143;you chosen spirit, if you’d have me move;kirkpatrick
2;13;6546;144;my living tread on earth to serve your needs.’;kirkpatrick
2;13;6547;145;‘Well, that’s,’ she said, ‘a strange new thing to hear,;kirkpatrick
2;13;6548;146;a great sign of the love God bears to you.;kirkpatrick
2;13;6549;147;Do help me sometimes when you say your prayers.;kirkpatrick
2;13;6550;148;I beg of you, by that for which you yearn,;kirkpatrick
2;13;6551;149;if you should ever tread on Tuscan soil,;kirkpatrick
2;13;6552;150;make my name good for those most near to me.;kirkpatrick
2;13;6553;151;You’ll ﬁnd them with that empty-headed crowd;kirkpatrick
2;13;6554;152;whose hopes are set on Talamone’s port.;kirkpatrick
2;13;6555;153;They’ll lose more there than tracing Dian’s source.;kirkpatrick
2;13;6556;154;The venturers, though, will come oﬀ much the worse.’;kirkpatrick
2;14;6557;1;‘Who’s this one here who’s circling round our Hill;kirkpatrick
2;14;6558;2;before Death’s given him the right to ﬂy,;kirkpatrick
2;14;6559;3;opening his eyes and closing them at will?’;kirkpatrick
2;14;6560;4;‘I don’t know who, but know he’s not alone.;kirkpatrick
2;14;6561;5;You ask, since you are closer up to him.;kirkpatrick
2;14;6562;6;And treat him gently so he’ll speak to us.’;kirkpatrick
2;14;6563;7;Two spirits – each one leaning on the next –;kirkpatrick
2;14;6564;8;thus talked about me on the right-hand side,;kirkpatrick
2;14;6565;9;then laid their heads back, to have words with me.;kirkpatrick
2;14;6566;10;And one now said: ‘O you, that soul who goes,;kirkpatrick
2;14;6567;11;still ﬁxed in mortal limb, towards the skies,;kirkpatrick
2;14;6568;12;gives us, in charity, some ease and say;kirkpatrick
2;14;6569;13;what place you’re from, and who it is you are.;kirkpatrick
2;14;6570;14;You make us marvel at the grace you’ve gained –;kirkpatrick
2;14;6571;15;as much as must be at things never known.’;kirkpatrick
2;14;6572;16;And I: ‘Through Tuscany, a ranging stream;kirkpatrick
2;14;6573;17;cuts down from Falterona where it’s born –;kirkpatrick
2;14;6574;18;its course not sated for a hundred miles.;kirkpatrick
2;14;6575;19;I bring this body from that river’s bank.;kirkpatrick
2;14;6576;20;There’d be no point in saying who I am.;kirkpatrick
2;14;6577;21;My name, as yet, produces no great sound.’;kirkpatrick
2;14;6578;22;‘If, in my thoughts, I swoop on what you mean,’;kirkpatrick
2;14;6579;23;he then replied to me (the ﬁrst to speak),;kirkpatrick
2;14;6580;24;‘you are, I take it, talking of the Arno.’;kirkpatrick
2;14;6581;25;‘But why,’ the other asked, ‘did he then hide;kirkpatrick
2;14;6582;26;the name that designates that ﬂowing stream,;kirkpatrick
2;14;6583;27;as people do with something that they dread?’;kirkpatrick
2;14;6584;28;To which, in oﬀering a due reply,;kirkpatrick
2;14;6585;29;that shade ﬁrst-questioned answered: ‘I don’t know.;kirkpatrick
2;14;6586;30;It’s right, though, that that valley’s name should die.;kirkpatrick
2;14;6587;31;For from its origin, where those sheer hills;kirkpatrick
2;14;6588;32;(Pelorus was dissevered from that chain);kirkpatrick
2;14;6589;33;that breed more streams than many others do,;kirkpatrick
2;14;6590;34;down to the estuary where yet once more;kirkpatrick
2;14;6591;35;it pays back what the skies dry from the sea;kirkpatrick
2;14;6592;36;(rivers derive their onward spate from that);kirkpatrick
2;14;6593;37;virtue is ﬂed by all – an enemy!;kirkpatrick
2;14;6594;38;a hateful snake! – either because that place;kirkpatrick
2;14;6595;39;is fated so, or pierced by wickedness.;kirkpatrick
2;14;6596;40;The people dwelling in that wretched vale;kirkpatrick
2;14;6597;41;are changed in nature to the point at which;kirkpatrick
2;14;6598;42;it seems that Circe might provide their swill.;kirkpatrick
2;14;6599;43;Through brute swine, ﬁrstly, who far more deserve;kirkpatrick
2;14;6600;44;acorns for food than any human dish,;kirkpatrick
2;14;6601;45;it points the channel of its meagre path.;kirkpatrick
2;14;6602;46;Then, coming down, it lights on mongrel dogs;kirkpatrick
2;14;6603;47;snarling far worse than ever they can bite.;kirkpatrick
2;14;6604;48;From these it turns its snout in high disdain.;kirkpatrick
2;14;6605;49;So ever downwards – and the more it swells;kirkpatrick
2;14;6606;50;so much the more does this accursed ditch;kirkpatrick
2;14;6607;51;hit upon bitches now transformed to wolves.;kirkpatrick
2;14;6608;52;Then, having sunk through many a stagnant lake,;kirkpatrick
2;14;6609;53;it ﬁnds out foxes that, so full of guile,;kirkpatrick
2;14;6610;54;fear not at all that they might be out-tricked.;kirkpatrick
2;14;6611;55;Nor shall I cease to speak since this one hears.;kirkpatrick
2;14;6612;56;It will be good for him if he attends;kirkpatrick
2;14;6613;57;to what true spirit here unknots for me.;kirkpatrick
2;14;6614;58;I see your little nephew now become;kirkpatrick
2;14;6615;59;a hunter of those wolf packs on the bank;kirkpatrick
2;14;6616;60;of that ﬁerce stream, and he confounds them all.;kirkpatrick
2;14;6617;61;He sells their ﬂesh while this is still alive,;kirkpatrick
2;14;6618;62;then slays them like mere cattle past their prime.;kirkpatrick
2;14;6619;63;Many of life, himself of praise he robs.;kirkpatrick
2;14;6620;64;He comes out bloodied from that dismal wood,;kirkpatrick
2;14;6621;65;and leaves it so, a thousand years from now,;kirkpatrick
2;14;6622;66;it won’t rebranch and reach its primal state.’;kirkpatrick
2;14;6623;67;As at announcements of some grievous harm,;kirkpatrick
2;14;6624;68;whatever side the fangs of peril strike,;kirkpatrick
2;14;6625;69;the faces of those listening will grow grim,;kirkpatrick
2;14;6626;70;so did I see that other soul, who’d turned,;kirkpatrick
2;14;6627;71;setting his mind to hear, cloud and grow sad,;kirkpatrick
2;14;6628;72;in garnering up these words to his own heart.;kirkpatrick
2;14;6629;73;The speech of one and how the other looked;kirkpatrick
2;14;6630;74;made me the keener to be told their names,;kirkpatrick
2;14;6631;75;and so, with prayers as well, I made request.;kirkpatrick
2;14;6632;76;At which the spirit who ﬁrst spoke to me;kirkpatrick
2;14;6633;77;began once more: ‘You’d have me bring myself;kirkpatrick
2;14;6634;78;to do for you what you’ll not do for me.;kirkpatrick
2;14;6635;79;But since God wills that such great grace should shine;kirkpatrick
2;14;6636;80;through all your being, I’ll not grudge you this.;kirkpatrick
2;14;6637;81;Know, then, that I was Guido del Duca.;kirkpatrick
2;14;6638;82;My blood so ﬁred itself with envious thoughts;kirkpatrick
2;14;6639;83;that, if I saw some man transformed by joy,;kirkpatrick
2;14;6640;84;you’d then have seen me ﬂushed to liver green.;kirkpatrick
2;14;6641;85;From such a sowing I now reap the straw.;kirkpatrick
2;14;6642;86;You human creatures, why repose your hearts;kirkpatrick
2;14;6643;87;where you are banned from mutual exchange?;kirkpatrick
2;14;6644;88;This is Rinieri of the Calboli –;kirkpatrick
2;14;6645;89;the honour of that House, their pride. No one;kirkpatrick
2;14;6646;90;lays claim, as heir, to all his proven worth.;kirkpatrick
2;14;6647;91;Nor has his blood alone – between the Po,;kirkpatrick
2;14;6648;92;the hill, the sea and Reno – turned to waste,;kirkpatrick
2;14;6649;93;stripped of the good that truth and pleasure need.;kirkpatrick
2;14;6650;94;For all within these conﬁnes now is full;kirkpatrick
2;14;6651;95;of poisonous thickets, so it’s now too late;kirkpatrick
2;14;6652;96;for cultivation to reduce their grip.;kirkpatrick
2;14;6653;97;Where is good Lizio, Arrigo Mainardi?;kirkpatrick
2;14;6654;98;Pier Traversaro and Guido di Carpigna?;kirkpatrick
2;14;6655;99;Oh, Romagnuoli, you’re all bastards now.;kirkpatrick
2;14;6656;100;When in Bologna is a Fabbro bred?;kirkpatrick
2;14;6657;101;When in Faience a Bernadin di Fosco;kirkpatrick
2;14;6658;102;(branching so nobly from mere creeping weeds)?;kirkpatrick
2;14;6659;103;Don’t marvel, Tuscan, if you see me weep;kirkpatrick
2;14;6660;104;when I call back to mind, with Guido Prata,;kirkpatrick
2;14;6661;105;Ugolin d’Azzo (who once lived with us),;kirkpatrick
2;14;6662;106;Frederick Tignoso and his circle, too,;kirkpatrick
2;14;6663;107;the Traversara house, the Anastagians,;kirkpatrick
2;14;6664;108;(these last two having no descendants now),;kirkpatrick
2;14;6665;109;the knights and ladies, all the toil and ease;kirkpatrick
2;14;6666;110;that love and courtesy once made us seek,;kirkpatrick
2;14;6667;111;where now all hearts are criminal and base.;kirkpatrick
2;14;6668;112;O Bretinoro, why not take to heel,;kirkpatrick
2;14;6669;113;since your whole family has gone its way,;kirkpatrick
2;14;6670;114;as others do, eluding vice and ignominy.;kirkpatrick
2;14;6671;115;Bagnacaval, it’s good you don’t re-child,;kirkpatrick
2;14;6672;116;and bad for Castrocaro – far worse Conio! –;kirkpatrick
2;14;6673;117;so tangled up in childing worthless lords.;kirkpatrick
2;14;6674;118;The clan Pagani, once their demon’s gone,;kirkpatrick
2;14;6675;119;will do quite well, but not so well that pure;kirkpatrick
2;14;6676;120;account of them will ever now remain.;kirkpatrick
2;14;6677;121;O Ugolino of the Fantolines,;kirkpatrick
2;14;6678;122;your name is safe since none, demeaning you,;kirkpatrick
2;14;6679;123;is now expected who could dim your fame.;kirkpatrick
2;14;6680;124;But, Tuscan, you had better pass along.;kirkpatrick
2;14;6681;125;To weep delights me more than words now can.;kirkpatrick
2;14;6682;126;This talk has wrung my mind with such distress.’;kirkpatrick
2;14;6683;127;We knew those well-loved souls could hear our tread.;kirkpatrick
2;14;6684;128;Therefore, their silence, as we went our way,;kirkpatrick
2;14;6685;129;gave us the conﬁdence to take that path.;kirkpatrick
2;14;6686;130;So, going on, when once we were alone,;kirkpatrick
2;14;6687;131;just like a thunder bolt that rends the air,;kirkpatrick
2;14;6688;132;a voice rang out towards us, saying this:;kirkpatrick
2;14;6689;133;‘They’ll murder me whoever captures me!’;kirkpatrick
2;14;6690;134;then ﬂed like thunder when it fades away,;kirkpatrick
2;14;6691;135;the clouds abruptly being torn apart.;kirkpatrick
2;14;6692;136;Then, as our hearing gained some peace from that –;kirkpatrick
2;14;6693;137;just see! – a second with as great a crash;kirkpatrick
2;14;6694;138;seemed then at once to follow that ﬁrst peal.;kirkpatrick
2;14;6695;139;‘I am Aglauros, who became a stone!’;kirkpatrick
2;14;6696;140;And then, to get up closer to the poet,;kirkpatrick
2;14;6697;141;I stepped not forwards but towards the right.;kirkpatrick
2;14;6698;142;The air was quiet now on every side;kirkpatrick
2;14;6699;143;and, ‘That was the restraint’ (so Virgil said);kirkpatrick
2;14;6700;144;‘that ought to keep mankind within due bounds.;kirkpatrick
2;14;6701;145;You take the bait, though. So the well-barbed hook;kirkpatrick
2;14;6702;146;of our old enemy will draw you in.;kirkpatrick
2;14;6703;147;And that’s why checks and lures have little power.;kirkpatrick
2;14;6704;148;The heavens wheel around and summon you,;kirkpatrick
2;14;6705;149;displaying to your eyes eternal charms.;kirkpatrick
2;14;6706;150;Yet your gaze ﬁxes merely on the ground.;kirkpatrick
2;14;6707;151;For that, He strikes you down who sees all clear.’;kirkpatrick
2;15;6708;1;As much time as the childlike circle plays;kirkpatrick
2;15;6709;2;between the third hour at its ultimate;kirkpatrick
2;15;6710;3;and when the day had ﬁrst begun to rise,;kirkpatrick
2;15;6711;4;remained, it seemed – till evening – for the sun;kirkpatrick
2;15;6712;5;to travel and complete its onward way.;kirkpatrick
2;15;6713;6;There it was vespers (midnight in our clime).;kirkpatrick
2;15;6714;7;The sun’s rays struck us straight along the nose.;kirkpatrick
2;15;6715;8;For now the mountain had, by us, been turned;kirkpatrick
2;15;6716;9;so that we went direct towards the west.;kirkpatrick
2;15;6717;10;But then I felt my forehead weighted down;kirkpatrick
2;15;6718;11;by splendour far more bright than ﬁrst there’d been.;kirkpatrick
2;15;6719;12;It dazed me, wondering at these untold things.;kirkpatrick
2;15;6720;13;And so, towards the peak of my two brows;kirkpatrick
2;15;6721;14;I raised my hands and shaped myself a shield;kirkpatrick
2;15;6722;15;to pare these too great visibles away.;kirkpatrick
2;15;6723;16;Compare: from water or reﬂective glass;kirkpatrick
2;15;6724;17;a ray of light leaps back as opposite,;kirkpatrick
2;15;6725;18;rising exactly in the same degree;kirkpatrick
2;15;6726;19;(as tests and theory demonstrate) against;kirkpatrick
2;15;6727;20;a plumb-stone line as when it ﬁrst descends,;kirkpatrick
2;15;6728;21;equal as measured from that vertical.;kirkpatrick
2;15;6729;22;It seemed that I was struck by some such light;kirkpatrick
2;15;6730;23;that broke, reﬂected back, ahead of me,;kirkpatrick
2;15;6731;24;causing my eyes, in ﬂight, to speed away.;kirkpatrick
2;15;6732;25;‘My gentle father, what is this?’ I said.;kirkpatrick
2;15;6733;26;‘I can’t protect my eyes from it enough.;kirkpatrick
2;15;6734;27;It moves, it seems, towards us all the time.’;kirkpatrick
2;15;6735;28;‘Don’t marvel,’ he replied to me, ‘if still;kirkpatrick
2;15;6736;29;the family of the heavens yet bedazzle you.;kirkpatrick
2;15;6737;30;This comes as messenger, to bid us climb.;kirkpatrick
2;15;6738;31;And soon to see such things as these will bring;kirkpatrick
2;15;6739;32;not stupor, but delight to you as great;kirkpatrick
2;15;6740;33;as you by nature are disposed to feel.’;kirkpatrick
2;15;6741;34;And when we’d come to where the angel was,;kirkpatrick
2;15;6742;35;the blessed creature said in tones of joy:;kirkpatrick
2;15;6743;36;‘Enter this stair – less steep than those before.’;kirkpatrick
2;15;6744;37;And climbing now (the angel left below);kirkpatrick
2;15;6745;38;behind us, ‘Beati misericordes!’;kirkpatrick
2;15;6746;39;and ‘Rejoice! You conqueror!’ were sung.;kirkpatrick
2;15;6747;40;Together, my teacher and I alone;kirkpatrick
2;15;6748;41;proceeded upward and, while going on,;kirkpatrick
2;15;6749;42;I thought I’d gain some proﬁt from his words,;kirkpatrick
2;15;6750;43;so turned to him, demanding he should say:;kirkpatrick
2;15;6751;44;‘What did that spirit of Romagna mean;kirkpatrick
2;15;6752;45;to speak of “mutual exchange” and “bans”?’;kirkpatrick
2;15;6753;46;‘He knows the damage done by his main ﬂaw.;kirkpatrick
2;15;6754;47;Don’t therefore be surprised,’ he said, ‘if he;kirkpatrick
2;15;6755;48;chides us, to lessen penitential tears.;kirkpatrick
2;15;6756;49;Because your human longings point to where;kirkpatrick
2;15;6757;50;portions grow smaller in shared fellowship,;kirkpatrick
2;15;6758;51;meanness of mind must make the bellows sigh.;kirkpatrick
2;15;6759;52;If love, though, seeking for the utmost sphere,;kirkpatrick
2;15;6760;53;should ever wrench your longings to the skies,;kirkpatrick
2;15;6761;54;such fears would have no place within your breast.;kirkpatrick
2;15;6762;55;For, there, the more that we can speak of “ours”,;kirkpatrick
2;15;6763;56;the more each one possesses of the good;kirkpatrick
2;15;6764;57;and, in that cloister, caritas burns brighter.’;kirkpatrick
2;15;6765;58;‘I hunger more for satisfaction now;kirkpatrick
2;15;6766;59;than if,’ I said, ‘you’d not said anything.;kirkpatrick
2;15;6767;60;I gather in my mind still greater doubt.;kirkpatrick
2;15;6768;61;How can it be that good distributed;kirkpatrick
2;15;6769;62;to many owners makes, in that respect,;kirkpatrick
2;15;6770;63;each one far richer than if few had shared?’;kirkpatrick
2;15;6771;64;‘You thrust your mind,’ he answered, ‘back down there;kirkpatrick
2;15;6772;65;and, thinking still in terms of earthly things,;kirkpatrick
2;15;6773;66;you tease out darkness from the light of truth.;kirkpatrick
2;15;6774;67;The Good that – inﬁnite beyond all words –;kirkpatrick
2;15;6775;68;is there above will run to love like rays;kirkpatrick
2;15;6776;69;of light that come to anything that shines.;kirkpatrick
2;15;6777;70;It gives itself proportioned to the ﬁre,;kirkpatrick
2;15;6778;71;so that, as far as caritas extends,;kirkpatrick
2;15;6779;72;eternal Worth increases over it.;kirkpatrick
2;15;6780;73;The more there are who ﬁx their minds up there,;kirkpatrick
2;15;6781;74;the more good love there is – and more to love –;kirkpatrick
2;15;6782;75;and each (as might a mirror) gives to each.;kirkpatrick
2;15;6783;76;And if these words of mine don’t slake your thirst,;kirkpatrick
2;15;6784;77;you’ll see Beatrice. And she, in all, in full,;kirkpatrick
2;15;6785;78;will ease this craving – as she’ll others, too.;kirkpatrick
2;15;6786;79;Press forward, then. For these ﬁve wounds that heal,;kirkpatrick
2;15;6787;80;through all the pain they bring, will soon;kirkpatrick
2;15;6788;81;be gone, as are by now the other two.’;kirkpatrick
2;15;6789;82;Intending here to say: ‘You’ve fed me well’,;kirkpatrick
2;15;6790;83;I saw that I had reached the upper ring.;kirkpatrick
2;15;6791;84;And there my eyes, entranced, now silenced me.;kirkpatrick
2;15;6792;85;For, in a sudden-seeing ecstasy,;kirkpatrick
2;15;6793;86;I was, it seemed, caught up and made to see;kirkpatrick
2;15;6794;87;a temple, many thronging all around.;kirkpatrick
2;15;6795;88;There at the door a lady stood who said –;kirkpatrick
2;15;6796;89;sweet in her manner as a mother is:;kirkpatrick
2;15;6797;90;‘Why, dearest son, have you done this to us?;kirkpatrick
2;15;6798;91;Look at how, grieving, your father and I;kirkpatrick
2;15;6799;92;have searched for you!’ And she falling silent,;kirkpatrick
2;15;6800;93;what ﬁrst appeared now disappeared from view.;kirkpatrick
2;15;6801;94;A second woman now appeared to me.;kirkpatrick
2;15;6802;95;Her cheeks were washed with streams that grief distils;kirkpatrick
2;15;6803;96;when grief is born in us from angry scorn.;kirkpatrick
2;15;6804;97;‘If you,’ she said, ‘are lord of that great place;kirkpatrick
2;15;6805;98;whose name caused so much strife among the gods,;kirkpatrick
2;15;6806;99;and yet from which all knowledge sparkles out,;kirkpatrick
2;15;6807;100;take vengeance on those hands, Pisistratus,;kirkpatrick
2;15;6808;101;that clasped our daughter in their rash embrace.’;kirkpatrick
2;15;6809;102;That lord, to me, seemed mild and generous;kirkpatrick
2;15;6810;103;and – temperate in expression – answered her:;kirkpatrick
2;15;6811;104;‘What shall we do to those that wish us ill;kirkpatrick
2;15;6812;105;if those that love us are condemned by us?’;kirkpatrick
2;15;6813;106;I saw, next, crowds enﬂamed in ﬁres of wrath,;kirkpatrick
2;15;6814;107;all yelling out to all a loud ‘Kill! Kill!’,;kirkpatrick
2;15;6815;108;stoning a young man to the point of death.;kirkpatrick
2;15;6816;109;And he, I saw, bowed down towards the earth;kirkpatrick
2;15;6817;110;as death imposed on him its heavy weight,;kirkpatrick
2;15;6818;111;yet still he bore his eyes towards the skies;kirkpatrick
2;15;6819;112;(his look that look which opens pity’s lock);kirkpatrick
2;15;6820;113;praying in so much strife that Heaven’s Lord;kirkpatrick
2;15;6821;114;should pardon those who’d hunted him to death.;kirkpatrick
2;15;6822;115;When once my soul turned outwards once again;kirkpatrick
2;15;6823;116;to beings truly there outside itself,;kirkpatrick
2;15;6824;117;I’d strayed, I saw, towards not-false error.;kirkpatrick
2;15;6825;118;My leader, who could see that I behaved;kirkpatrick
2;15;6826;119;like someone who has just escaped from sleep,;kirkpatrick
2;15;6827;120;exclaimed: ‘What’s wrong?Why can’t you stand straight;kirkpatrick
2;15;6828;121;up?;kirkpatrick
2;15;6829;122;You’ve come along for half a mile or more;kirkpatrick
2;15;6830;123;veiling your eyes, your legs turned all askew,;kirkpatrick
2;15;6831;124;like someone in the grip of sleep or drink.’;kirkpatrick
2;15;6832;125;‘My dearest father, if you’ll hear me out,;kirkpatrick
2;15;6833;126;I’ll tell you what appeared to me,’ I said,;kirkpatrick
2;15;6834;127;‘during the time my legs were snatched from me.’;kirkpatrick
2;15;6835;128;‘Had you a thousand masks around your face,;kirkpatrick
2;15;6836;129;your thinking,’ he replied, ‘would not, to me,;kirkpatrick
2;15;6837;130;be hidden, even in the least degree.;kirkpatrick
2;15;6838;131;You’ve seen these things. So you’ll have no excuse;kirkpatrick
2;15;6839;132;if you don’t give your heart to streams of peace;kirkpatrick
2;15;6840;133;which spread out from their everlasting source.;kirkpatrick
2;15;6841;134;I did not ask, “What’s wrong?” as those might do;kirkpatrick
2;15;6842;135;who only see with eyes that do not see,;kirkpatrick
2;15;6843;136;staring at bodies that are drained of life,;kirkpatrick
2;15;6844;137;but rather asked to give your stride more strength.;kirkpatrick
2;15;6845;138;You need to prod the indolent like this,;kirkpatrick
2;15;6846;139;slow as they are to use their waking powers.’;kirkpatrick
2;15;6847;140;Walking towards the setting sun, we stretched;kirkpatrick
2;15;6848;141;to see as far beyond as eyes could reach;kirkpatrick
2;15;6849;142;against the brilliance of the evening rays.;kirkpatrick
2;15;6850;143;Then, bit by bit, a rising cloud of smoke,;kirkpatrick
2;15;6851;144;as dark as night, began to form ahead.;kirkpatrick
2;15;6852;145;There was no way for us to turn aside.;kirkpatrick
2;15;6853;146;It took from us our eyesight and pure air.;kirkpatrick
2;16;6854;1;Darkness in Hell, or any night stripped bare;kirkpatrick
2;16;6855;2;of planets under impoverished skies;kirkpatrick
2;16;6856;3;(a pall of clouds as dense as these could be),;kirkpatrick
2;16;6857;4;has never formed, for me, as thick a veil;kirkpatrick
2;16;6858;5;as did the smoke that now surrounded us,;kirkpatrick
2;16;6859;6;or stretched a weave so rasping in its feel;kirkpatrick
2;16;6860;7;that eyes could not stay open to its touch.;kirkpatrick
2;16;6861;8;Therefore, my guide, as ever wise and true,;kirkpatrick
2;16;6862;9;came to my side, his shoulder lending aid.;kirkpatrick
2;16;6863;10;And, as a blind man goes behind his guide –;kirkpatrick
2;16;6864;11;for fear he’ll wander or collide with things;kirkpatrick
2;16;6865;12;that might well maim him or, perhaps, could kill –  I,;kirkpatrick
2;16;6866;13;too, went on through acrid, ﬁlthy air,;kirkpatrick
2;16;6867;14;attending to my leader, who would say,;kirkpatrick
2;16;6868;15;‘Take care. Don’t get cut oﬀ!’ repeatedly.;kirkpatrick
2;16;6869;16;I now heard voices. And it seemed that each;kirkpatrick
2;16;6870;17;was praying to the Lamb of God, who takes;kirkpatrick
2;16;6871;18;all sin away, for mercy and for peace.;kirkpatrick
2;16;6872;19;The words they uttered ﬁrst were ‘Agnus Dei’ –;kirkpatrick
2;16;6873;20;the self-same text and tune from all of them,;kirkpatrick
2;16;6874;21;so that, it seemed, at heart they sang as one.;kirkpatrick
2;16;6875;22;‘Are these all spirits, sir, that I can hear?’;kirkpatrick
2;16;6876;23;I spoke. He answered: ‘Yes. In that you’re right.;kirkpatrick
2;16;6877;24;And anger is the knot they’re working free.’;kirkpatrick
2;16;6878;25;‘And who are you, that cleave our smoke-ﬁlled air,;kirkpatrick
2;16;6879;26;and speaks of us as though (if this could be);kirkpatrick
2;16;6880;27;you still divided time by month and year?’;kirkpatrick
2;16;6881;28;These words were those that one voice uttered now.;kirkpatrick
2;16;6882;29;At which my teacher said to me: ‘Reply.;kirkpatrick
2;16;6883;30;Ask them if we can make our climb from here.’;kirkpatrick
2;16;6884;31;And I: ‘My fellow creature, who now wash;kirkpatrick
2;16;6885;32;to go once more in beauty to your maker,;kirkpatrick
2;16;6886;33;you, if you follow close, will hear of wonders.’;kirkpatrick
2;16;6887;34;‘I’ll follow you as far as I’m allowed.;kirkpatrick
2;16;6888;35;And if,’ he said, ‘the smoke won’t let us see,;kirkpatrick
2;16;6889;36;hearing instead will keep us closely joined.’;kirkpatrick
2;16;6890;37;‘Still swaddled in the clothes that death dissolves’;kirkpatrick
2;16;6891;38;(so I began) ‘I make my way above,;kirkpatrick
2;16;6892;39;and come here from the agonies of Hell.;kirkpatrick
2;16;6893;40;And if God circles me with such great grace;kirkpatrick
2;16;6894;41;that I, as He desires, should see His court,;kirkpatrick
2;16;6895;42;in ways beyond what men of our day know,;kirkpatrick
2;16;6896;43;then do not hide who you were till your death,;kirkpatrick
2;16;6897;44;but speak and tell me: am I near the rise?;kirkpatrick
2;16;6898;45;And your words only will become our guide.’;kirkpatrick
2;16;6899;46;‘I was a Lombard, and my name was Mark.;kirkpatrick
2;16;6900;47;I knew the world and loved that noble worth;kirkpatrick
2;16;6901;48;at which all now aim slack and unslung bows.;kirkpatrick
2;16;6902;49;To make your climb, just take the straight way on.’;kirkpatrick
2;16;6903;50;He answered thus, and added then: ‘I pray;kirkpatrick
2;16;6904;51;that you should pray for me, when you’re up there.’;kirkpatrick
2;16;6905;52;And I to him: ‘Through faith I bind myself;kirkpatrick
2;16;6906;53;to do what you demand. And yet I burst,;kirkpatrick
2;16;6907;54;if you will not explain, with one great doubt.;kirkpatrick
2;16;6908;55;Though simple to begin with, what you say;kirkpatrick
2;16;6909;56;has made doubt double now. That makes me sure;kirkpatrick
2;16;6910;57;I’m right to couple things heard here and elsewhere.;kirkpatrick
2;16;6911;58;The world is, truly, as your words declare,;kirkpatrick
2;16;6912;59;a sterile place where every virtue fails –;kirkpatrick
2;16;6913;60;pregnant with viciousness that blankets all.;kirkpatrick
2;16;6914;61;Point me, I beg you, to the reason why,;kirkpatrick
2;16;6915;62;so I can see and then show others, too.;kirkpatrick
2;16;6916;63;Some place the cause in stars, some here below.’;kirkpatrick
2;16;6917;64;A long, deep sigh that grief dragged out to ‘Uhi’;kirkpatrick
2;16;6918;65;he uttered ﬁrst, then ‘Brother,’ he began,;kirkpatrick
2;16;6919;66;‘the world is blind, and, yes, that’s where you’re from.;kirkpatrick
2;16;6920;67;You, living there, derive the cause of all;kirkpatrick
2;16;6921;68;straight from the stars alone, as if, alone,;kirkpatrick
2;16;6922;69;these made all move in mere necessity.;kirkpatrick
2;16;6923;70;Yet were that so, in you would be destroyed;kirkpatrick
2;16;6924;71;the freedom of your will – and justice fail;kirkpatrick
2;16;6925;72;in giving good its joy and grief its ill.;kirkpatrick
2;16;6926;73;The stars initiate your vital moves.;kirkpatrick
2;16;6927;74;I don’t say all. And yet suppose I did,;kirkpatrick
2;16;6928;75;you’re given light to know what’s good and bad,;kirkpatrick
2;16;6929;76;and free will, too, which if it can endure;kirkpatrick
2;16;6930;77;beyond its early battles with the stars,;kirkpatrick
2;16;6931;78;and if it’s nourished well, will conquer all.;kirkpatrick
2;16;6932;79;Of better nature and of greater power;kirkpatrick
2;16;6933;80;you are free subjects. And you have a mind;kirkpatrick
2;16;6934;81;that planets cannot rule or stars concern.;kirkpatrick
2;16;6935;82;So if the present world has gone astray,;kirkpatrick
2;16;6936;83;the reason lies in you, in you it’s sought,;kirkpatrick
2;16;6937;84;and I, on your behalf, will spy it out.;kirkpatrick
2;16;6938;85;Leaving the hand of him who holds it dear;kirkpatrick
2;16;6939;86;(before it truly is ), it weeps and laughs,;kirkpatrick
2;16;6940;87;that little simple soul, and baby-plays,;kirkpatrick
2;16;6941;88;as young girls do, and does not know a thing –;kirkpatrick
2;16;6942;89;save only, as moved by a joyous Maker,;kirkpatrick
2;16;6943;90;it willingly turns to every playful thrill.;kirkpatrick
2;16;6944;91;It tastes the ﬂavour, ﬁrst, of some small good,;kirkpatrick
2;16;6945;92;and, fooled by this, it chases down its track,;kirkpatrick
2;16;6946;93;unless a brake or guide bends such love back.;kirkpatrick
2;16;6947;94;So law is needed to apply this brake.;kirkpatrick
2;16;6948;95;A king is needed, with the skill to see;kirkpatrick
2;16;6949;96;the towers of that true city, at the least.;kirkpatrick
2;16;6950;97;The laws are there. Who sets his hand to these?;kirkpatrick
2;16;6951;98;There’s no one. For the shepherd out ahead,;kirkpatrick
2;16;6952;99;though he can chew the cud, has not split hooves.;kirkpatrick
2;16;6953;100;So people, when they see their leader snatch;kirkpatrick
2;16;6954;101;at those same goods that greedily they crave,;kirkpatrick
2;16;6955;102;graze on just those, and do not seek beyond.;kirkpatrick
2;16;6956;103;So – as you may well see – bad government;kirkpatrick
2;16;6957;104;is why the world is so malignant now.;kirkpatrick
2;16;6958;105;It’s not that nature is corrupt in you.;kirkpatrick
2;16;6959;106;Once, Rome, which made this world for us pure good,;kirkpatrick
2;16;6960;107;had two suns in its sky. And these made known;kirkpatrick
2;16;6961;108;both roads to take, the world’s and that of God.;kirkpatrick
2;16;6962;109;One sun has snuﬀed the other out. The sword;kirkpatrick
2;16;6963;110;is joined now to the shepherd’s crook. And ill;kirkpatrick
2;16;6964;111;is bound to follow when force links these two.;kirkpatrick
2;16;6965;112;For, once they’re joined, there can’t be mutual dread.;kirkpatrick
2;16;6966;113;And if you don’t believe this, think of crops,;kirkpatrick
2;16;6967;114;where grass is known according to its seed.;kirkpatrick
2;16;6968;115;Before the Emperor Frederick was opposed,;kirkpatrick
2;16;6969;116;in regions washed by Po and Adige;kirkpatrick
2;16;6970;117;all courtesy and prowess could be found.;kirkpatrick
2;16;6971;118;Now anyone is safe to travel through;kirkpatrick
2;16;6972;119;who might avoid, from sheer embarrassment,;kirkpatrick
2;16;6973;120;speech or encounters with good, honest men.;kirkpatrick
2;16;6974;121;There are, it’s true, three old ones there in whom;kirkpatrick
2;16;6975;122;times now long gone rebuke the new. To them,;kirkpatrick
2;16;6976;123;in granting better life, God seems too slow.;kirkpatrick
2;16;6977;124;Currado da Palazzo, good Gherardo;kirkpatrick
2;16;6978;125;and Guido da Castello, better named;kirkpatrick
2;16;6979;126;the “honest Lombard” – as French travellers do.;kirkpatrick
2;16;6980;127;So you can say this now: the Church of Rome,;kirkpatrick
2;16;6981;128;by mingling in itself two forms of rule,;kirkpatrick
2;16;6982;129;falls in the mud, befouling self and load.’;kirkpatrick
2;16;6983;130;‘Dear Mark,’ I said, ‘your argument runs well.;kirkpatrick
2;16;6984;131;And now I see why Levi’s priestly sons;kirkpatrick
2;16;6985;132;were all excluded from inheritance.;kirkpatrick
2;16;6986;133;But who’s that “Gerard” whom you say remains;kirkpatrick
2;16;6987;134;as pattern of an age that is no more,;kirkpatrick
2;16;6988;135;to speak reproaches to our savage time?’;kirkpatrick
2;16;6989;136;‘Your words are meant to test,’ so he replied,;kirkpatrick
2;16;6990;137;‘or else to have me on. You’re speaking Tuscan,;kirkpatrick
2;16;6991;138;yet have no clue, it seems, about good Gerard!;kirkpatrick
2;16;6992;139;I know no other name by which he’s known –;kirkpatrick
2;16;6993;140;unless I draw it from his daughter’s shame.;kirkpatrick
2;16;6994;141;May God go with you. I can’t come along.;kirkpatrick
2;16;6995;142;You see that bright gleam, dawning through the smoke,;kirkpatrick
2;16;6996;143;already whitening. I must now go back –;kirkpatrick
2;16;6997;144;the angel’s there – before I’m shown to him.’;kirkpatrick
2;16;6998;145;He turned, and would not hear me any more.;kirkpatrick
2;17;6999;1;Reader, recall, if ever in the hills;kirkpatrick
2;17;7000;2;a fog has caught you so you couldn’t see;kirkpatrick
2;17;7001;3;(or only as a mole does through its skin),;kirkpatrick
2;17;7002;4;then how, as vapours, clinging, damp and dense,;kirkpatrick
2;17;7003;5;begin to dissipate, the sun’s round disc;kirkpatrick
2;17;7004;6;enters, and feebly makes its way through these.;kirkpatrick
2;17;7005;7;From this, you’ll easily be brought to see,;kirkpatrick
2;17;7006;8;in your imagination, how I saw;kirkpatrick
2;17;7007;9;the sun again, already setting now.;kirkpatrick
2;17;7008;10;So, levelling with my teacher’s trusted steps,;kirkpatrick
2;17;7009;11;I came out from that cloud, along with him,;kirkpatrick
2;17;7010;12;to rays, down on the shore, already dead.;kirkpatrick
2;17;7011;13;Imagination, you at times will steal;kirkpatrick
2;17;7012;14;the outer world from us so we can’t tell;kirkpatrick
2;17;7013;15;(even if horns in thousands blare around);kirkpatrick
2;17;7014;16;who makes you move when sense does not provide.;kirkpatrick
2;17;7015;17;It’s light that moves you, formed in heavenly spheres by;kirkpatrick
2;17;7016;18;Will, which guides it down, or else per se.;kirkpatrick
2;17;7017;19;The godless wrath of one who changed her form;kirkpatrick
2;17;7018;20;to be that bird which most delights in song;kirkpatrick
2;17;7019;21;appeared, and left its footprint on my brain.;kirkpatrick
2;17;7020;22;My mind was now so clenched upon itself;kirkpatrick
2;17;7021;23;that nothing was received within its bounds;kirkpatrick
2;17;7022;24;that might have come from outside or beyond.;kirkpatrick
2;17;7023;25;And then, within these high imaginings,;kirkpatrick
2;17;7024;26;one cruciﬁed rained down. He, in his gaze,;kirkpatrick
2;17;7025;27;was ﬁerce and full of scorn and, like that, died.;kirkpatrick
2;17;7026;28;Around him were the great Ahasuerus,;kirkpatrick
2;17;7027;29;Esther (his wife) and honest Mordecai,;kirkpatrick
2;17;7028;30;who showed such probity in word and deed.;kirkpatrick
2;17;7029;31;This image of itself now burst – as might;kirkpatrick
2;17;7030;32;some rising bubble when the water fails,;kirkpatrick
2;17;7031;33;beneath the surface where it ﬁrst ﬁlled out.;kirkpatrick
2;17;7032;34;And then, within my vision, there rose up;kirkpatrick
2;17;7033;35;a girl who, weeping ﬁercely, said: ‘Great Queen!;kirkpatrick
2;17;7034;36;Why wish yourself as nothing in your wrath?;kirkpatrick
2;17;7035;37;To keep – not lose – Lavinia, you slew yourself.;kirkpatrick
2;17;7036;38;You’ve lost me now, dear mother. This is me.;kirkpatrick
2;17;7037;39;I mourn yours more than any other’s doom.’;kirkpatrick
2;17;7038;40;As sleep is shattered when some strange new light;kirkpatrick
2;17;7039;41;strikes, on the sudden, at our closed-up eye,;kirkpatrick
2;17;7040;42;then ﬂickers for a moment till it dies,;kirkpatrick
2;17;7041;43;so, too, these images I saw crashed down,;kirkpatrick
2;17;7042;44;as, now, a light struck hard against my face,;kirkpatrick
2;17;7043;45;greater by far than those to which we’re used.;kirkpatrick
2;17;7044;46;I turned around to see where I might be.;kirkpatrick
2;17;7045;47;At which, a voice spoke out: ‘You go up here.’;kirkpatrick
2;17;7046;48;This distanced me from any other thought,;kirkpatrick
2;17;7047;49;and wrought in me that great desire to see;kirkpatrick
2;17;7048;50;‘Who was it that said this to me?’ which won’t;kirkpatrick
2;17;7049;51;admit of rest until we’re face to face.;kirkpatrick
2;17;7050;52;But, as when sun weighs heavy on our sight;kirkpatrick
2;17;7051;53;and veils its shape in overwhelming glare,;kirkpatrick
2;17;7052;54;so did my inner powers at this fall short.;kirkpatrick
2;17;7053;55;‘This spirit is divine. Before we’ve asked,;kirkpatrick
2;17;7054;56;it indicates the way to go above,;kirkpatrick
2;17;7055;57;and hides itself within the light it gives.;kirkpatrick
2;17;7056;58;It treats us as we like to treat ourselves.;kirkpatrick
2;17;7057;59;For those who see a need yet wait for prayers;kirkpatrick
2;17;7058;60;ill-willingly stand ready to refuse.;kirkpatrick
2;17;7059;61;To this great welcome let us tune our pace;kirkpatrick
2;17;7060;62;and strive to climb before the darkness falls –;kirkpatrick
2;17;7061;63;we cannot, otherwise, till day returns.’;kirkpatrick
2;17;7062;64;So said my leader and, along with him,;kirkpatrick
2;17;7063;65;I turned my step to make towards a stair.;kirkpatrick
2;17;7064;66;As soon, though, as I reached its lowest tread,;kirkpatrick
2;17;7065;67;I felt close by a movement as of wings,;kirkpatrick
2;17;7066;68;a fanning at my face and words: ‘Beati;kirkpatrick
2;17;7067;69;paciﬁci – of violent wrath they’re free.’;kirkpatrick
2;17;7068;70;By now the ﬁnal rays, pursued by night,;kirkpatrick
2;17;7069;71;had risen over us, and gone so far;kirkpatrick
2;17;7070;72;that stars in many parts appeared to view.;kirkpatrick
2;17;7071;73;‘My strengths and powers! Why do you slip away?’;kirkpatrick
2;17;7072;74;(I said within myself.) ‘A truce, I feel,;kirkpatrick
2;17;7073;75;has been imposed upon my striding thighs.’;kirkpatrick
2;17;7074;76;We’d got to where the stairway rose no more.;kirkpatrick
2;17;7075;77;And there we stuck – as ﬁxedly as ships;kirkpatrick
2;17;7076;78;that beach themselves, arriving at the shore.;kirkpatrick
2;17;7077;79;I waited for a while, in case I heard;kirkpatrick
2;17;7078;80;some sign in this new ring of anything,;kirkpatrick
2;17;7079;81;then, turning to my teacher, I said now:;kirkpatrick
2;17;7080;82;‘My dearest teacher, tell me what oﬀence;kirkpatrick
2;17;7081;83;is purged within the circle where we are.;kirkpatrick
2;17;7082;84;Our feet stand still. Don’t let your words do so.’;kirkpatrick
2;17;7083;85;‘The love of good,’ he said, ‘when this falls short;kirkpatrick
2;17;7084;86;of what it ought to be, is here restored.;kirkpatrick
2;17;7085;87;The oar that wrongly slackened strikes once more.;kirkpatrick
2;17;7086;88;But, so you may more plainly understand,;kirkpatrick
2;17;7087;89;turn, pay attention and, from this short wait,;kirkpatrick
2;17;7088;90;you’ll carry oﬀ some truly worthwhile fruit.;kirkpatrick
2;17;7089;91;Neither creator nor created thing;kirkpatrick
2;17;7090;92;was ever, dearest son, without’ (he starts);kirkpatrick
2;17;7091;93;‘the love of mind or nature. You know that.;kirkpatrick
2;17;7092;94;The natural love can never go astray.;kirkpatrick
2;17;7093;95;The other, though, may err when wrongly aimed,;kirkpatrick
2;17;7094;96;or else through too much vigour or the lack.;kirkpatrick
2;17;7095;97;Where mind-love sets itself on primal good;kirkpatrick
2;17;7096;98;and keeps, in secondaries, a due control,;kirkpatrick
2;17;7097;99;it cannot be the cause of false delight.;kirkpatrick
2;17;7098;100;But when it wrongly twists towards the ill,;kirkpatrick
2;17;7099;101;or runs towards the good too fast or slow,;kirkpatrick
2;17;7100;102;what’s made then works against its maker’s plan.;kirkpatrick
2;17;7101;103;Hence, of necessity, you’ll understand;kirkpatrick
2;17;7102;104;that love must be the seed of all good powers,;kirkpatrick
2;17;7103;105;as, too, of penalties your deeds deserve.;kirkpatrick
2;17;7104;106;Now, since love cannot turn its face away;kirkpatrick
2;17;7105;107;from that which greets it with a promised health, all things;kirkpatrick
2;17;7106;108;are safe from hatred of themselves,;kirkpatrick
2;17;7107;109;and since no being can be understood;kirkpatrick
2;17;7108;110;as independent, separate, from the First,;kirkpatrick
2;17;7109;111;eﬀects, decidedly, can’t hate their source.;kirkpatrick
2;17;7110;112;Restat : if I’ve prepared the ground aright,;kirkpatrick
2;17;7111;113;the ill we love must be our neighbour’s harm.;kirkpatrick
2;17;7112;114;Such “love” is born in three ways from your slime.;kirkpatrick
2;17;7113;115;Some hope, by keeping all their neighbours down,;kirkpatrick
2;17;7114;116;that they’ll excel. They yearn for that alone –;kirkpatrick
2;17;7115;117;to see them brought from high to low estate.;kirkpatrick
2;17;7116;118;Then, some will fear that, if another mounts,;kirkpatrick
2;17;7117;119;they’ll lose all honour, fame and grace and power, so,;kirkpatrick
2;17;7118;120;grieving at success, love what it’s not.;kirkpatrick
2;17;7119;121;And some, it seems, when hurt, bear such a grudge;kirkpatrick
2;17;7120;122;that they crave only to exact revenge –;kirkpatrick
2;17;7121;123;which means they seek to speed another’s harm.;kirkpatrick
2;17;7122;124;This tri-formed love is wept for down below.;kirkpatrick
2;17;7123;125;But now I’d have you understand the next;kirkpatrick
2;17;7124;126;which runs, in broken order, after good.;kirkpatrick
2;17;7125;127;We all, confusedly, conceive a good,;kirkpatrick
2;17;7126;128;desiring that our hearts may rest in that.;kirkpatrick
2;17;7127;129;And each will strive to make their way to it.;kirkpatrick
2;17;7128;130;If love is slack in drawing you to view –;kirkpatrick
2;17;7129;131;or win – that good, then this ledge, where we’re now, after;kirkpatrick
2;17;7130;132;your ﬁt repentance, martyrs you.;kirkpatrick
2;17;7131;133;And other goods will not bring happiness,;kirkpatrick
2;17;7132;134;not happy in themselves, nor that good source;kirkpatrick
2;17;7133;135;of being, seed and ﬂower of all that’s good.;kirkpatrick
2;17;7134;136;The love that gives itself too much to these;kirkpatrick
2;17;7135;137;is wept for in the circles still above.;kirkpatrick
2;17;7136;138;But why “tripartite” I shall not here say,;kirkpatrick
2;17;7137;139;so you can seek the reason for yourself.’;kirkpatrick
2;18;7138;1;That great authority concluded here.;kirkpatrick
2;18;7139;2;Attentively, he looked me in the face,;kirkpatrick
2;18;7140;3;to see if I was pleased and satisﬁed.;kirkpatrick
2;18;7141;4;And I (a new thirst searching through my brain);kirkpatrick
2;18;7142;5;was silent outwardly but said within:;kirkpatrick
2;18;7143;6;‘Too many questions may, perhaps, annoy him.’;kirkpatrick
2;18;7144;7;He, though, true father that he was, had seen;kirkpatrick
2;18;7145;8;this hesitant desire unopened yet,;kirkpatrick
2;18;7146;9;and, speaking, gave me courage to speak out.;kirkpatrick
2;18;7147;10;‘My power to see,’ I said, ‘in your light, sir,;kirkpatrick
2;18;7148;11;grows bright, alive in me, so – yes – I’m clear;kirkpatrick
2;18;7149;12;on every point your words deﬁne and stress.;kirkpatrick
2;18;7150;13;And so, my dear, kind father, I entreat;kirkpatrick
2;18;7151;14;that you expound for me that love to which;kirkpatrick
2;18;7152;15;you trace all good acts and their opposite.’;kirkpatrick
2;18;7153;16;‘Direct on me,’ he said, ‘your mind’s sharp light.;kirkpatrick
2;18;7154;17;And I shall make quite evident to you;kirkpatrick
2;18;7155;18;the error of the blind – who claim they lead.;kirkpatrick
2;18;7156;19;The mind, which is created quick to love,;kirkpatrick
2;18;7157;20;when roused by pleasure into conscious act;kirkpatrick
2;18;7158;21;will tend towards such things as give delight.;kirkpatrick
2;18;7159;22;From things that truly are, your apprehensio;kirkpatrick
2;18;7160;23;draws out an image which it then unfolds;kirkpatrick
2;18;7161;24;within you, so that mind turns round to it.;kirkpatrick
2;18;7162;25;If mind, once having turned, inclines to that,;kirkpatrick
2;18;7163;26;this bending is called love – and “nature”, too –;kirkpatrick
2;18;7164;27;bound up in you afresh by pleasure’s knot.;kirkpatrick
2;18;7165;28;And then, as ﬁre moves upwards to the heights;kirkpatrick
2;18;7166;29;(by virtue of its form, it’s born to rise;kirkpatrick
2;18;7167;30;to where it may, as matter, most endure),;kirkpatrick
2;18;7168;31;so minds, when captured, pass into desire –;kirkpatrick
2;18;7169;32;a motion of the spirit that won’t pause;kirkpatrick
2;18;7170;33;until the thing it loves has yielded joy.;kirkpatrick
2;18;7171;34;From which, it’s clear, you’ll ﬁnd how far truth hides;kirkpatrick
2;18;7172;35;from those who think it true that all love is –;kirkpatrick
2;18;7173;36;in all its types – deserving of our praise,;kirkpatrick
2;18;7174;37;perhaps because its matter, seemingly,;kirkpatrick
2;18;7175;38;is always good. Yet, grant the wax is good,;kirkpatrick
2;18;7176;39;the seal need not be so in every print.’;kirkpatrick
2;18;7177;40;‘Your words (and, walking in their track, my wits);kirkpatrick
2;18;7178;41;disclose to me what love is,’ I replied.;kirkpatrick
2;18;7179;42;‘Yet this, for me, gives birth to greater doubt.;kirkpatrick
2;18;7180;43;If love is just an oﬀering from outside ,;kirkpatrick
2;18;7181;44;and souls go forward on no other foot,;kirkpatrick
2;18;7182;45;then going right or wrong involves no merit.’;kirkpatrick
2;18;7183;46;‘I can, as far as reason sees, respond.;kirkpatrick
2;18;7184;47;Beyond that, faith’s required’ (so he to me);kirkpatrick
2;18;7185;48;‘and you must therefore wait for Beatrice.;kirkpatrick
2;18;7186;49;Forms of substantiality (distinct;kirkpatrick
2;18;7187;50;from matter, though at one with that) collect,;kirkpatrick
2;18;7188;51;each one within itself, speciﬁc powers.;kirkpatrick
2;18;7189;52;These powers, unless they act, are not perceived,;kirkpatrick
2;18;7190;53;nor are they known except by their eﬀects –;kirkpatrick
2;18;7191;54;as life appears in plants when leaves are green.;kirkpatrick
2;18;7192;55;No one can, therefore, see from where there comes;kirkpatrick
2;18;7193;56;the sense of primal concepts that we have,;kirkpatrick
2;18;7194;57;nor our desire for prime desirables.;kirkpatrick
2;18;7195;58;These are in you as is the urge in bees;kirkpatrick
2;18;7196;59;to make their honey. And this primal will;kirkpatrick
2;18;7197;60;cannot be credited with blame or praise.;kirkpatrick
2;18;7198;61;To group all other wills around the ﬁrst,;kirkpatrick
2;18;7199;62;there is a counselling power innate in you;kirkpatrick
2;18;7200;63;that’s meant to guard the threshold of consent.;kirkpatrick
2;18;7201;64;This is the principle from which derives;kirkpatrick
2;18;7202;65;the inward rationale of just desert;kirkpatrick
2;18;7203;66;that stores or winnows good love from what’s bad.;kirkpatrick
2;18;7204;67;And those who argued all things to the core;kirkpatrick
2;18;7205;68;took notice of this inborn liberty,;kirkpatrick
2;18;7206;69;and so bequeathed to us a moral rule.;kirkpatrick
2;18;7207;70;Suppose that love, then, of necessity;kirkpatrick
2;18;7208;71;does rise in you, when once its ﬁre begins,;kirkpatrick
2;18;7209;72;you have within the power to rein it back.;kirkpatrick
2;18;7210;73;This power, which Beatrice understands,;kirkpatrick
2;18;7211;74;is freedom of the will. And so take care;kirkpatrick
2;18;7212;75;that, if she speaks of it, it’s in your mind.’;kirkpatrick
2;18;7213;76;The moon at almost midnight, slow to rise;kirkpatrick
2;18;7214;77;(formed like a copper bucket burnished red),;kirkpatrick
2;18;7215;78;now made the stars seem fewer in the sky,;kirkpatrick
2;18;7216;79;and ran against the heavens around those roads;kirkpatrick
2;18;7217;80;where sunlight ﬂames when anyone in Rome;kirkpatrick
2;18;7218;81;observes it set between the Sards and Corsicans.;kirkpatrick
2;18;7219;82;That noble shade, for whom Pietola;kirkpatrick
2;18;7220;83;is named above all other Mantuan towns,;kirkpatrick
2;18;7221;84;had now laid down the burden I’d imposed.;kirkpatrick
2;18;7222;85;So, having harvested his plain, frank words –;kirkpatrick
2;18;7223;86;which answered all the questions I had had –;kirkpatrick
2;18;7224;87;I stood like someone in a drowsy blank.;kirkpatrick
2;18;7225;88;But all such drowsiness was borne away;kirkpatrick
2;18;7226;89;by people who had suddenly appeared,;kirkpatrick
2;18;7227;90;swinging towards us from behind our backs.;kirkpatrick
2;18;7228;91;As once the Asop and Ismenus saw,;kirkpatrick
2;18;7229;92;whenever Thebans needed Bacchus’s aid,;kirkpatrick
2;18;7230;93;orgies at night, feet pounding by their banks,;kirkpatrick
2;18;7231;94;so here – from what I saw as these came on –;kirkpatrick
2;18;7232;95;they, too, ran scything round the mountain’s curve,;kirkpatrick
2;18;7233;96;spurred on and ridden by good love and will.;kirkpatrick
2;18;7234;97;Soon they were on us. For they moved at speed,;kirkpatrick
2;18;7235;98;racing towards us, that great multitude.;kirkpatrick
2;18;7236;99;And two ahead were shouting, weepingly.;kirkpatrick
2;18;7237;100;‘Maria hastened up to Juda’s hill!’;kirkpatrick
2;18;7238;101;And, ‘Caesar, bringing Lerida to heel,;kirkpatrick
2;18;7239;102;struck at Marseilles and then ran into Spain.’;kirkpatrick
2;18;7240;103;‘Quick! Quick! Let’s lose no time through lack of love!’;kirkpatrick
2;18;7241;104;so all of those behind now shouted out.;kirkpatrick
2;18;7242;105;‘For zeal in doing good turns grace new green.’;kirkpatrick
2;18;7243;106;‘You people, whose keen fervour now repays;kirkpatrick
2;18;7244;107;some negligence or else delay of yours,;kirkpatrick
2;18;7245;108;through tepidness in acting for the good,;kirkpatrick
2;18;7246;109;this man (he’s living, and I tell no lie);kirkpatrick
2;18;7247;110;desires, when sunlight shines on us again,;kirkpatrick
2;18;7248;111;to go on up. So where’s the closest gap?’;kirkpatrick
2;18;7249;112;These were the words my leader spoke to them.;kirkpatrick
2;18;7250;113;And one among these spirits now replied:;kirkpatrick
2;18;7251;114;‘Come! Follow us and you’ll soon ﬁnd that hole.;kirkpatrick
2;18;7252;115;Full of desire to move ourselves along,;kirkpatrick
2;18;7253;116;we cannot pause. And therefore, pardon us,;kirkpatrick
2;18;7254;117;if what for us is right, seems crass and wrong.;kirkpatrick
2;18;7255;118;When Barbarossa ruled – that good, true lord;kirkpatrick
2;18;7256;119;of whom Milan still speaks with pain and grief –;kirkpatrick
2;18;7257;120;I, at Verona, was San Zeno’s Dom.;kirkpatrick
2;18;7258;121;And there’s a man with one foot in the grave;kirkpatrick
2;18;7259;122;who’ll bitterly bewail that abbey soon,;kirkpatrick
2;18;7260;123;and grieve the power that he had over it.;kirkpatrick
2;18;7261;124;For he, where one true shepherd should have been,;kirkpatrick
2;18;7262;125;has placed his son, diseased throughout his frame, and;kirkpatrick
2;18;7263;126;worse than sick in mind, a bastard born.’;kirkpatrick
2;18;7264;127;He’d run so far beyond us by this time,;kirkpatrick
2;18;7265;128;I don’t know if his words went on or ceased.;kirkpatrick
2;18;7266;129;This much I heeded and would gladly keep.;kirkpatrick
2;18;7267;130;And he who helps me in my every need;kirkpatrick
2;18;7268;131;said now: ‘Turn round, and look at these two here, who,;kirkpatrick
2;18;7269;132;fast approaching, put the bite on sloth.’;kirkpatrick
2;18;7270;133;Behind the rest, these two were calling: ‘First,;kirkpatrick
2;18;7271;134;before the river Jordan saw their heirs,;kirkpatrick
2;18;7272;135;all those for whom the sea had opened, died!’;kirkpatrick
2;18;7273;136;And: ‘Those who couldn’t bear until the end;kirkpatrick
2;18;7274;137;the labours that Anchises’ son endured,;kirkpatrick
2;18;7275;138;submitted to a life where honour lacked.’;kirkpatrick
2;18;7276;139;Then, when these shades had split so far from us;kirkpatrick
2;18;7277;140;that neither any more could be observed,;kirkpatrick
2;18;7278;141;a new thought set itself within my mind,;kirkpatrick
2;18;7279;142;from which were born yet other, diﬀering thoughts.;kirkpatrick
2;18;7280;143;And so I wandered round from this to that;kirkpatrick
2;18;7281;144;and, dozing oﬀ, I gladly closed my eyes,;kirkpatrick
2;18;7282;145;transforming all my thinking into dream.;kirkpatrick
2;19;7283;1;Now, at that hour when daytime heat cannot –;kirkpatrick
2;19;7284;2;vanquished by earth and, sometimes, Saturn’s rays –;kirkpatrick
2;19;7285;3;sustain its warmth against the chilling moon,;kirkpatrick
2;19;7286;4;when geomancers in the east trace out,;kirkpatrick
2;19;7287;5;before the dawn their signs of Greater Fortune;kirkpatrick
2;19;7288;6;(the path these climb is only brieﬂy dark),;kirkpatrick
2;19;7289;7;there came, dreaming, to me a stammering crone,;kirkpatrick
2;19;7290;8;cross-eyed and crooked on her crippled feet,;kirkpatrick
2;19;7291;9;her hands mere stumps, and drained and pale in look.;kirkpatrick
2;19;7292;10;I gazed at her. Then, as to frozen limbs;kirkpatrick
2;19;7293;11;when night has weighed them down, the sun gives;kirkpatrick
2;19;7294;12;strength, likewise my staring made her free, longtongued,;kirkpatrick
2;19;7295;13;to speak, and drew her, in the briefest space,;kirkpatrick
2;19;7296;14;erect in every limb, giving the hue;kirkpatrick
2;19;7297;15;that love desires to her blurred, pallid face.;kirkpatrick
2;19;7298;16;And once her powers of speech were thus untied,;kirkpatrick
2;19;7299;17;she then began to sing, so I could not,;kirkpatrick
2;19;7300;18;except with pain, have drawn my eyes away.;kirkpatrick
2;19;7301;19;‘I am,’ she sang, ‘I am the lovely siren.;kirkpatrick
2;19;7302;20;So full of pleasure to the ear my tune;kirkpatrick
2;19;7303;21;that mariners I magic in mid-ocean.;kirkpatrick
2;19;7304;22;And Ulysses, entranced to hear my chant,;kirkpatrick
2;19;7305;23;I turned oﬀ course. Rarely do those who’ve learned my;kirkpatrick
2;19;7306;24;ways depart. I bring them full content.’;kirkpatrick
2;19;7307;25;And then, before that mouth closed up once more,;kirkpatrick
2;19;7308;26;a lady – holy and alert – appeared;kirkpatrick
2;19;7309;27;and, at my side, she crushed the other’s power.;kirkpatrick
2;19;7310;28;‘Virgil! O Virgil!’ – in the harshest tones –;kirkpatrick
2;19;7311;29;‘Who’s that?’ she said. And he approached, eyes set,;kirkpatrick
2;19;7312;30;unwavering, on her true nobility.;kirkpatrick
2;19;7313;31;He seized the Siren, ripping down her dress,;kirkpatrick
2;19;7314;32;opened the front of her, displayed her guts,;kirkpatrick
2;19;7315;33;and that, with all its stench, now woke me up.;kirkpatrick
2;19;7316;34;I swung my eyes around. ‘Three times, at least,;kirkpatrick
2;19;7317;35;I’ve voiced this. Come!’ (My trusted teacher spoke.) ‘Get;kirkpatrick
2;19;7318;36;up! Let’s ﬁnd an opening you can take.’;kirkpatrick
2;19;7319;37;Up I now got. And all the circles round;kirkpatrick
2;19;7320;38;the holy hill were full of highest day.;kirkpatrick
2;19;7321;39;We went along, the new sun at our backs.;kirkpatrick
2;19;7322;40;Now following in his track, I bore my brow;kirkpatrick
2;19;7323;41;as people do when – loaded down with thought –;kirkpatrick
2;19;7324;42;they make themselves the half-arch of a bridge.;kirkpatrick
2;19;7325;43;And then I heard: ‘Come on! The crossing’s here!’;kirkpatrick
2;19;7326;44;spoken in tones more soft and generous;kirkpatrick
2;19;7327;45;than ever could be heard in mortal shires.;kirkpatrick
2;19;7328;46;With open wings, as, seemingly, a swan’s,;kirkpatrick
2;19;7329;47;the one who’d spoken turned us to the heights;kirkpatrick
2;19;7330;48;between two walls within the granite rock.;kirkpatrick
2;19;7331;49;He moved his feathers and he fanned us both,;kirkpatrick
2;19;7332;50;aﬃrming that ‘qui lugent’ are the blessed.;kirkpatrick
2;19;7333;51;To them the gift of consolation comes.;kirkpatrick
2;19;7334;52;‘What’s got to you? You still stare at the ground.’;kirkpatrick
2;19;7335;53;When once beyond the angel, climbing on,;kirkpatrick
2;19;7336;54;these were the words with which my guide began.;kirkpatrick
2;19;7337;55;‘I’m made to make my way in so much doubt;kirkpatrick
2;19;7338;56;by that weird vision – which so wraps me up;kirkpatrick
2;19;7339;57;I just can’t leave oﬀ thinking back to it.’;kirkpatrick
2;19;7340;58;‘You saw,’ he said to me, ‘the ancient witch.;kirkpatrick
2;19;7341;59;For her the penitents above us weep.;kirkpatrick
2;19;7342;60;You saw how men are loosened from her grip.;kirkpatrick
2;19;7343;61;Let that suﬃce. So strike your heels to earth;kirkpatrick
2;19;7344;62;and turn your eyes to see the lure that’s spun;kirkpatrick
2;19;7345;63;in mighty wheels by one eternal king.’;kirkpatrick
2;19;7346;64;A falcon, ﬁrst, looks down towards its feet,;kirkpatrick
2;19;7347;65;then, being called, will turn and stretch full length, drawn;kirkpatrick
2;19;7348;66;by desire to reach the oﬀered food.;kirkpatrick
2;19;7349;67;And so did I. Through one split span of rock,;kirkpatrick
2;19;7350;68;which served as entrance to the upward path,;kirkpatrick
2;19;7351;69;I went to where the ring above begins.;kirkpatrick
2;19;7352;70;Now loosed out on to circle number ﬁve,;kirkpatrick
2;19;7353;71;I saw there people all around who wept,;kirkpatrick
2;19;7354;72;each turned face downwards, lying on the earth.;kirkpatrick
2;19;7355;73;‘Adhaesit pavimento anima mea!’;kirkpatrick
2;19;7356;74;I heard them saying this, but sighing deep;kirkpatrick
2;19;7357;75;so what they said was hardly understood.;kirkpatrick
2;19;7358;76;‘You chosen ones of God whose suﬀerings are,;kirkpatrick
2;19;7359;77;by hope and justice, made less hard to bear,;kirkpatrick
2;19;7360;78;direct me to the steep way we must climb.’;kirkpatrick
2;19;7361;79;‘If you come here exempt from lying ﬂat,;kirkpatrick
2;19;7362;80;and wish to ﬁnd the quickest way ahead,;kirkpatrick
2;19;7363;81;your right hands will be always to the out.’;kirkpatrick
2;19;7364;82;This was the poet’s prayer, and thus – a bit;kirkpatrick
2;19;7365;83;ahead of us – the answer came. And I,;kirkpatrick
2;19;7366;84;on hearing this, knew where the rest were hid.;kirkpatrick
2;19;7367;85;I turned my eyes to meet my lord’s own eyes.;kirkpatrick
2;19;7368;86;And he assented with a happy sign;kirkpatrick
2;19;7369;87;to what my face displayed as its desire.;kirkpatrick
2;19;7370;88;So, being free to act as I saw ﬁt,;kirkpatrick
2;19;7371;89;I drew myself across and stood above;kirkpatrick
2;19;7372;90;that being whose words had made ﬁrst me note,;kirkpatrick
2;19;7373;91;saying: ‘You spirit who, in tears, matures;kirkpatrick
2;19;7374;92;that without which no soul can turn to God,;kirkpatrick
2;19;7375;93;for my sake, leave awhile your greater care.;kirkpatrick
2;19;7376;94;Who were you? Tell me that, and why you’ve turned;kirkpatrick
2;19;7377;95;your backs above – and what you’d have me beg;kirkpatrick
2;19;7378;96;on your behalf, returning whence I moved.’;kirkpatrick
2;19;7379;97;‘Why Heaven should turn our rears against itself;kirkpatrick
2;19;7380;98;you’ll shortly know,’ he said to me. ‘But ﬁrst;kirkpatrick
2;19;7381;99;scias quod ego fui successor Petri.;kirkpatrick
2;19;7382;100;Between Siestri and Chiavari;kirkpatrick
2;19;7383;101;a lovely stream descends, and from its name;kirkpatrick
2;19;7384;102;my blood derives the height of all its claims.;kirkpatrick
2;19;7385;103;A month, no more than that, I knew the weight;kirkpatrick
2;19;7386;104;of keeping papal garments from the mud.;kirkpatrick
2;19;7387;105;Compared with that, all loads are feather light.;kirkpatrick
2;19;7388;106;My own conversion was, alas, too late.;kirkpatrick
2;19;7389;107;And yet, made shepherd of the Roman ﬂock,;kirkpatrick
2;19;7390;108;the lies of life revealed themselves to me.;kirkpatrick
2;19;7391;109;I saw the heart will never rest in these.;kirkpatrick
2;19;7392;110;And I could not rise higher in that life.;kirkpatrick
2;19;7393;111;So love of this life then caught ﬁre in me.;kirkpatrick
2;19;7394;112;I was, until that point, a wretched soul.;kirkpatrick
2;19;7395;113;Divorced from God, my all was avarice.;kirkpatrick
2;19;7396;114;And I am punished, as you see, for that.;kirkpatrick
2;19;7397;115;What avarice will do is now made clear;kirkpatrick
2;19;7398;116;through penance in these souls, inverted so.;kirkpatrick
2;19;7399;117;The mountain has no pain more harsh than this.;kirkpatrick
2;19;7400;118;Because our eyes were ﬁxed on earthly things,;kirkpatrick
2;19;7401;119;at no point raised to look towards the heights,;kirkpatrick
2;19;7402;120;so justice sinks them here within the earth.;kirkpatrick
2;19;7403;121;Since avarice extinguished all our love;kirkpatrick
2;19;7404;122;for any good – and so good works were lost –;kirkpatrick
2;19;7405;123;justice here holds us tight within its grip.;kirkpatrick
2;19;7406;124;We’re captives, bound at both our hands and feet,;kirkpatrick
2;19;7407;125;and here stretched out, unmoving, we shall stay,;kirkpatrick
2;19;7408;126;as long as our just Lord may think it right.’;kirkpatrick
2;19;7409;127;I’d fallen to my knees and meant to speak.;kirkpatrick
2;19;7410;128;But he, as soon as I’d begun, took note –;kirkpatrick
2;19;7411;129;simply on hearing my respectful bow.;kirkpatrick
2;19;7412;130;‘What makes you twist like that?’ he said to me,;kirkpatrick
2;19;7413;131;and I to him: ‘Aware of your high rank,;kirkpatrick
2;19;7414;132;my conscience bit me when I stood erect.’;kirkpatrick
2;19;7415;133;‘Straighten your knee, my brother. Just get up!;kirkpatrick
2;19;7416;134;Make no mistake. I am – along with you;kirkpatrick
2;19;7417;135;and all – co-servant of one single Power.;kirkpatrick
2;19;7418;136;If ever you have heard aright the sound;kirkpatrick
2;19;7419;137;of Holy Gospel in ‘neque nubent’;kirkpatrick
2;19;7420;138;then you can see why I should argue thus.;kirkpatrick
2;19;7421;139;Now go away. I’d not delay you more.;kirkpatrick
2;19;7422;140;You, standing there, upset the tears I shed,;kirkpatrick
2;19;7423;141;by which I ripen penance as you said.;kirkpatrick
2;19;7424;142;I have, down there, a niece. Her name’s Alagia,;kirkpatrick
2;19;7425;143;good in herself – provided that our house;kirkpatrick
2;19;7426;144;does not, by bad example, make her worse.;kirkpatrick
2;19;7427;145;And she alone is left of me back there.’;kirkpatrick
2;20;7428;1;Against a better will, will can’t well ﬁght.;kirkpatrick
2;20;7429;2;And so, against what pleased me, pleasing him ,;kirkpatrick
2;20;7430;3;I drew the sponge still thirsty from the stream.;kirkpatrick
2;20;7431;4;I moved myself. My leader moved through those;kirkpatrick
2;20;7432;5;free spaces that, around the cliﬀ, remained – tightly, as by;kirkpatrick
2;20;7433;6;some castle’s battlements –;kirkpatrick
2;20;7434;7;since all those people, melting drop by drop,;kirkpatrick
2;20;7435;8;in tears, the ill that holds the world in thrall, encroached;kirkpatrick
2;20;7436;9;too far upon the outer part.;kirkpatrick
2;20;7437;10;Curses on you, you wolf bitch, ages old!;kirkpatrick
2;20;7438;11;You snatch more prey than all the other beasts, endlessly;kirkpatrick
2;20;7439;12;hollow in your hungering.;kirkpatrick
2;20;7440;13;You heavens, whose revolutions, we believe,;kirkpatrick
2;20;7441;14;alter the way things are with us down here,;kirkpatrick
2;20;7442;15;when will He come to put this wolf to ﬂight?;kirkpatrick
2;20;7443;16;We went our way with slow, restricted tread,;kirkpatrick
2;20;7444;17;I listening to the shadows whom I heard;kirkpatrick
2;20;7445;18;weeping in piteously sharp distress,;kirkpatrick
2;20;7446;19;and chanced to hear ahead of us the cry,;kirkpatrick
2;20;7447;20;‘Sweet Mary!’ uttered in those ﬂoods of tears that women;kirkpatrick
2;20;7448;21;scream when labouring at a birth.;kirkpatrick
2;20;7449;22;The voice went on: ‘What poverty you knew;kirkpatrick
2;20;7450;23;we all can see from that poor lodging house;kirkpatrick
2;20;7451;24;in which you laid your holy burden down.’;kirkpatrick
2;20;7452;25;Then, following this: ‘O good Fabrizio,;kirkpatrick
2;20;7453;26;you chose the way of honest penury;kirkpatrick
2;20;7454;27;above the treasures that were stained with vice.’;kirkpatrick
2;20;7455;28;To me, these words had such a pleasing sound;kirkpatrick
2;20;7456;29;that I pressed forward to be clear about;kirkpatrick
2;20;7457;30;the spirit who, it seemed, had spoken them.;kirkpatrick
2;20;7458;31;He still was speaking of the generous gifts;kirkpatrick
2;20;7459;32;that Nicholas once made to those young girls,;kirkpatrick
2;20;7460;33;to save the honour of their threatened youth.;kirkpatrick
2;20;7461;34;‘O soul! Your words shed light on so much good.;kirkpatrick
2;20;7462;35;Tell me,’ I said, ‘who were you – and why you;kirkpatrick
2;20;7463;36;alone renew these words of worthy praise.;kirkpatrick
2;20;7464;37;If I return to ﬁnish that short road;kirkpatrick
2;20;7465;38;of life on earth which ﬂies towards its end,;kirkpatrick
2;20;7466;39;your answer won’t remain without reward.’;kirkpatrick
2;20;7467;40;‘I’ll say,’ he answered, ‘(though support from there;kirkpatrick
2;20;7468;41;I don’t expect) because in you yourself,;kirkpatrick
2;20;7469;42;before your death, so great a grace shines forth.;kirkpatrick
2;20;7470;43;I was the root from which that sick weed grows;kirkpatrick
2;20;7471;44;that overshadows every Christian land,;kirkpatrick
2;20;7472;45;so that it’s rare to strip good fruit from it.;kirkpatrick
2;20;7473;46;If Douai, though, or Ghent or Bruges or Lille;kirkpatrick
2;20;7474;47;could get their way, then vengeance would be swift.;kirkpatrick
2;20;7475;48;I pray for it from Him who judges all.;kirkpatrick
2;20;7476;49;I was, down there, called Hugh Capet once.;kirkpatrick
2;20;7477;50;From me were born those Louis and Philippes;kirkpatrick
2;20;7478;51;by whom in these new days our France is ruled.;kirkpatrick
2;20;7479;52;I was from Paris, and a butcher’s son.;kirkpatrick
2;20;7480;53;And when the line of ancient kings died out –;kirkpatrick
2;20;7481;54;all gone, save one who wears a monk’s dark cowl –  I;kirkpatrick
2;20;7482;55;found my hands were tight around the reins;kirkpatrick
2;20;7483;56;that govern in that realm, and so empowered;kirkpatrick
2;20;7484;57;in making that new gain, with friends so full,  that, to;kirkpatrick
2;20;7485;58;the widowed crown my son’s own head;kirkpatrick
2;20;7486;59;received advancement. And from him began;kirkpatrick
2;20;7487;60;our lineage of consecrated bones.;kirkpatrick
2;20;7488;61;Until that splendid dowry of Provence;kirkpatrick
2;20;7489;62;deprived my blood of any sense of shame,;kirkpatrick
2;20;7490;63;they didn’t do much good – nor much great harm.;kirkpatrick
2;20;7491;64;There, there began, with violence and with lies,;kirkpatrick
2;20;7492;65;their course of plunderings. And to put things right,;kirkpatrick
2;20;7493;66;Ponthieu they seized, then Norman lands, then Gascon.;kirkpatrick
2;20;7494;67;Then Charles reached Italy. To put things right,;kirkpatrick
2;20;7495;68;he sacriﬁced young Conradin, then sent;kirkpatrick
2;20;7496;69;Saint Thomas to the skies, to put things right.;kirkpatrick
2;20;7497;70;I see a time, not very far from now,;kirkpatrick
2;20;7498;71;that brings another Carlo out of France;kirkpatrick
2;20;7499;72;to make his clan and him the better known.;kirkpatrick
2;20;7500;73;Unarmed he comes. And simply with that lance;kirkpatrick
2;20;7501;74;that Judas jousted with, he aims then stabs;kirkpatrick
2;20;7502;75;the guts of Florence till the belly bursts.;kirkpatrick
2;20;7503;76;From this, his proﬁt will be no mere land,;kirkpatrick
2;20;7504;77;but sin and shame – the heavier for him;kirkpatrick
2;20;7505;78;the more he counts as light the harm he does.;kirkpatrick
2;20;7506;79;The other – captured, once, on board his ship –;kirkpatrick
2;20;7507;80;I now see sells his daughter, bargaining;kirkpatrick
2;20;7508;81;as pirates do in deals for female slaves.;kirkpatrick
2;20;7509;82;O avarice! What more harm can you do?;kirkpatrick
2;20;7510;83;You’ve got my blood so ﬁrmly in your grip,;kirkpatrick
2;20;7511;84;it takes no thought about its own kin’s ﬂesh.;kirkpatrick
2;20;7512;85;To make its past and future crimes seem less,;kirkpatrick
2;20;7513;86;I see the ﬂeur-de-lys besiege Anagni,;kirkpatrick
2;20;7514;87;and Christ recaptured in his vicar’s form.;kirkpatrick
2;20;7515;88;I see them mocking him a second time.;kirkpatrick
2;20;7516;89;I see renewed the vinegar and gall.;kirkpatrick
2;20;7517;90;I see him slain again with living thieves.;kirkpatrick
2;20;7518;91;I see renewed a Pilate who’s so cruel,;kirkpatrick
2;20;7519;92;unsatisﬁed, he bears with no just cause;kirkpatrick
2;20;7520;93;his greedy saints towards the Temple walls.;kirkpatrick
2;20;7521;94;My Lord and God! When shall I see in joy;kirkpatrick
2;20;7522;95;that just revenge that, hidden to our view,;kirkpatrick
2;20;7523;96;makes anger in your secret counsels sweet?;kirkpatrick
2;20;7524;97;Those words I spoke about the one true Bride;kirkpatrick
2;20;7525;98;of God’s Own Spirit – those that made you turn, seeking;kirkpatrick
2;20;7526;99;from me some further commentary –  respond, while;kirkpatrick
2;20;7527;100;daylight lasts, to all our prayers.;kirkpatrick
2;20;7528;101;But as the darkness of the night sets in;kirkpatrick
2;20;7529;102;we then sound out the contrary tune.;kirkpatrick
2;20;7530;103;We now call back to mind Pygmalion,;kirkpatrick
2;20;7531;104;whose hankering after gold made his will turn;kirkpatrick
2;20;7532;105;to treachery and theft and parricide.;kirkpatrick
2;20;7533;106;Then, too, the misery of miser Midas,;kirkpatrick
2;20;7534;107;caused by that gluttonous demand of his,;kirkpatrick
2;20;7535;108;for which he’ll always be ridiculous.;kirkpatrick
2;20;7536;109;Then each recalls mad Achan’s escapade,;kirkpatrick
2;20;7537;110;and how he stole the spoils of Jericho –;kirkpatrick
2;20;7538;111;so Joshua’s anger seems to gnaw him still.;kirkpatrick
2;20;7539;112;We blame Sapphira, and her husband, too,;kirkpatrick
2;20;7540;113;and praise the hooves that trampled Heliodore.;kirkpatrick
2;20;7541;114;And round the mount, in notoriety,;kirkpatrick
2;20;7542;115;goes Polymnestor who slew Polydore.;kirkpatrick
2;20;7543;116;Then ﬁnally our cry of “Crassus!” comes.;kirkpatrick
2;20;7544;117;“You know. So tell us! What’s the taste of gold?”;kirkpatrick
2;20;7545;118;These words are spoken high or sometimes low,;kirkpatrick
2;20;7546;119;responding to the urge that makes us move,;kirkpatrick
2;20;7547;120;spurred to a greater or a lesser pace.;kirkpatrick
2;20;7548;121;In telling – as, by day, we do – the best,;kirkpatrick
2;20;7549;122;I was not, earlier, the only one.;kirkpatrick
2;20;7550;123;But no one else nearby had raised their voice.’;kirkpatrick
2;20;7551;124;We’d gone from him by now and, moving on,;kirkpatrick
2;20;7552;125;struggled, as far as we were given strength,;kirkpatrick
2;20;7553;126;to overcome the hardships of that road,;kirkpatrick
2;20;7554;127;when, as though things were crashing down, I heard;kirkpatrick
2;20;7555;128;the mountain tremble. And I felt the chill;kirkpatrick
2;20;7556;129;that all will suﬀer when they come to die.;kirkpatrick
2;20;7557;130;Delos itself did not so ﬁercely shake;kirkpatrick
2;20;7558;131;before Latona made a nest of it;kirkpatrick
2;20;7559;132;to bring to birth the two eyes of the sky.;kirkpatrick
2;20;7560;133;On every side there then began this cry;kirkpatrick
2;20;7561;134;(my teacher turned around to me to say,;kirkpatrick
2;20;7562;135;‘While I’m your guide, you need not be afraid’):;kirkpatrick
2;20;7563;136;‘Gloria in excelsis Deo!’ and all;kirkpatrick
2;20;7564;137;were speaking out these words, so I could tell the;kirkpatrick
2;20;7565;138;meaning of the cry from those close to.;kirkpatrick
2;20;7566;139;We stood unmoving, caught there in suspense –;kirkpatrick
2;20;7567;140;as were the shepherds who ﬁrst heard this song – until the;kirkpatrick
2;20;7568;141;tremor ceased and all was done.;kirkpatrick
2;20;7569;142;And then once more we took our holy path,;kirkpatrick
2;20;7570;143;looking at those that lay there on the earth;kirkpatrick
2;20;7571;144;who’d gone back, now, to their familiar tears.;kirkpatrick
2;20;7572;145;Never has ignorance with so much force;kirkpatrick
2;20;7573;146;(if, in my memory, I do not err);kirkpatrick
2;20;7574;147;driven me in my keen desire to know,;kirkpatrick
2;20;7575;148;as now it seemed to, thinking and thinking.;kirkpatrick
2;20;7576;149;Nor had I dared, in all our haste, to ask.;kirkpatrick
2;20;7577;150;Nor, for my part, could I see anything.;kirkpatrick
2;20;7578;151;So, timid, deep in thought, I travelled on.;kirkpatrick
2;21;7579;1;The natural thirst that never can be slaked;kirkpatrick
2;21;7580;2;save by those waters that, as gracious gift,;kirkpatrick
2;21;7581;3;the widowed, bright Samaritan demanded once,;kirkpatrick
2;21;7582;4;toiled in me now, while hurry spurred my steps,;kirkpatrick
2;21;7583;5;behind my leader, round the cluttered path,;kirkpatrick
2;21;7584;6;mourning within to see that just revenge.;kirkpatrick
2;21;7585;7;And look! As in his gospel Luke describes;kirkpatrick
2;21;7586;8;how Christ, when risen from the hollow tomb,;kirkpatrick
2;21;7587;9;appeared to two who travelled on their way –;kirkpatrick
2;21;7588;10;a shadow from behind us now appeared.;kirkpatrick
2;21;7589;11;Still looking at the crowd around our feet,;kirkpatrick
2;21;7590;12;we didn’t notice till it spoke and said:;kirkpatrick
2;21;7591;13;‘May God, my brothers, bring to you His peace.’;kirkpatrick
2;21;7592;14;We turned round suddenly. And Virgil made;kirkpatrick
2;21;7593;15;a ﬁtting gesture to reply to this.;kirkpatrick
2;21;7594;16;Then he began: ‘May that true government;kirkpatrick
2;21;7595;17;which keeps me bound in exile endlessly;kirkpatrick
2;21;7596;18;grant you a place within that happy court.’;kirkpatrick
2;21;7597;19;‘What’s that?’ he said, as we still hurried on.;kirkpatrick
2;21;7598;20;‘If you are shades that God won’t let ascend,;kirkpatrick
2;21;7599;21;who, then, has led you up this stair so far?’;kirkpatrick
2;21;7600;22;‘If you observe,’ my teacher said, ‘those signs;kirkpatrick
2;21;7601;23;he’s bearing and the angel traces out,;kirkpatrick
2;21;7602;24;you’ll see it’s right that he reigns with the good.;kirkpatrick
2;21;7603;25;But since the fate that spins thread day and night;kirkpatrick
2;21;7604;26;has not, in his case, yet drawn out the skein;kirkpatrick
2;21;7605;27;that Clotho casts and spins for every life,;kirkpatrick
2;21;7606;28;his soul – a sister to both yours and mine –;kirkpatrick
2;21;7607;29;though coming here cannot come on its own.;kirkpatrick
2;21;7608;30;Its eyes as yet don’t see as our eyes do.;kirkpatrick
2;21;7609;31;And I was therefore drawn from Hell’s wide throat;kirkpatrick
2;21;7610;32;to show him – and I’ve still to show him more – as much as;kirkpatrick
2;21;7611;33;my own schooling will allow.;kirkpatrick
2;21;7612;34;But if you’re able, tell me why the mount;kirkpatrick
2;21;7613;35;shuddered just now so hard, and why it seemed;kirkpatrick
2;21;7614;36;to cry, down to its plashy foot, as one.’;kirkpatrick
2;21;7615;37;In asking this, he pierced the needle’s eye;kirkpatrick
2;21;7616;38;of all I longed to know. And so my thirst,;kirkpatrick
2;21;7617;39;through hope alone, became less keen in me.;kirkpatrick
2;21;7618;40;‘There’s nothing that this mountain’s holy law;kirkpatrick
2;21;7619;41;consents to,’ so the other now began,;kirkpatrick
2;21;7620;42;‘that’s lacking order or irregular.;kirkpatrick
2;21;7621;43;This place is free from every kind of change.;kirkpatrick
2;21;7622;44;Only what Heaven, of itself, receives;kirkpatrick
2;21;7623;45;can act here as a cause, and nothing else.;kirkpatrick
2;21;7624;46;Therefore no showers of rain, nor hail or snow,;kirkpatrick
2;21;7625;47;no dew or hoar frost ever falls above;kirkpatrick
2;21;7626;48;that little stairway with its three brief steps.;kirkpatrick
2;21;7627;49;No clouds here – whether rare or dense – appear,;kirkpatrick
2;21;7628;50;no glint of lightning nor the rainbow child;kirkpatrick
2;21;7629;51;of Thaumas, there so often changing place.;kirkpatrick
2;21;7630;52;And dry evaporations do not rise;kirkpatrick
2;21;7631;53;beyond the third and highest of those steps –;kirkpatrick
2;21;7632;54;I spoke of them – where Peter’s vicar stands.;kirkpatrick
2;21;7633;55;"Tremors occur below (some small, perhaps;";kirkpatrick
2;21;7634;56;some great). At these heights, though, no tremor comes;kirkpatrick
2;21;7635;57;from winds that hide (I can’t tell why) in earth.;kirkpatrick
2;21;7636;58;Tremors strike here when any soul feels pure;kirkpatrick
2;21;7637;59;and rises, newly cleansed, to start its climb.;kirkpatrick
2;21;7638;60;And that cry follows as the soul ascends.;kirkpatrick
2;21;7639;61;The will alone gives proof of purity;kirkpatrick
2;21;7640;62;when, wholly free to change its sacred place,;kirkpatrick
2;21;7641;63;it aids and sweeps the soul up, willing well.;kirkpatrick
2;21;7642;64;The soul till then indeed had willed ascent.;kirkpatrick
2;21;7643;65;But, set against that will there is the bent –;kirkpatrick
2;21;7644;66;which God instils – for pain as sin’s equivalent.;kirkpatrick
2;21;7645;67;And I, who’ve lain ﬁve hundred years and more;kirkpatrick
2;21;7646;68;in that same pain, have only felt just now;kirkpatrick
2;21;7647;69;the freedom of the better way ahead.;kirkpatrick
2;21;7648;70;That’s why you felt and heard those tremors here,;kirkpatrick
2;21;7649;71;and spirits round the mountain rendering praise, so God,;kirkpatrick
2;21;7650;72;our Lord, might send them higher soon.’;kirkpatrick
2;21;7651;73;He said these things to us. And since we take;kirkpatrick
2;21;7652;74;a joy in drinking equal to our thirst,;kirkpatrick
2;21;7653;75;I could not say what beneﬁt he’d brought.;kirkpatrick
2;21;7654;76;My lord, in wisdom: ‘Now I see the net;kirkpatrick
2;21;7655;77;that here entangles you – and your escape:;kirkpatrick
2;21;7656;78;why are there tremors here, why all rejoice?;kirkpatrick
2;21;7657;79;Now tell me, at your pleasure, so I’ll know,;kirkpatrick
2;21;7658;80;who were you? And your words, please, will include why;kirkpatrick
2;21;7659;81;you have lain so many centuries here.’;kirkpatrick
2;21;7660;82;‘In those days when good Titus, by the aid;kirkpatrick
2;21;7661;83;of our exalted King, avenged the wounds;kirkpatrick
2;21;7662;84;from which the blood that Judas sold had sprung,  I;kirkpatrick
2;21;7663;85;was,’ the spirit answered, ‘well renowned.;kirkpatrick
2;21;7664;86;My name down there was that which most endures, and;kirkpatrick
2;21;7665;87;honours most – not yet, though, of the Faith.;kirkpatrick
2;21;7666;88;My voice in spirit breathed so sweet that Rome;kirkpatrick
2;21;7667;89;took me to her own heart from French Toulouse,;kirkpatrick
2;21;7668;90;where merit dressed my brow with myrtle leaves.;kirkpatrick
2;21;7669;91;My name was Statius to the people there.;kirkpatrick
2;21;7670;92;I sang of Thebes and then of great Achilles,;kirkpatrick
2;21;7671;93;but stumbled carrying that second load.;kirkpatrick
2;21;7672;94;The seed my ardour sprang from was a spark;kirkpatrick
2;21;7673;95;which warmed me through of that most sacred ﬂame from;kirkpatrick
2;21;7674;96;which a thousand, and yet more, are lit.;kirkpatrick
2;21;7675;97;I’m speaking of the Aeneid – a mum;kirkpatrick
2;21;7676;98;to me, to me my nurse in poetry.;kirkpatrick
2;21;7677;99;Without that, I’d not weigh a single gram.;kirkpatrick
2;21;7678;100;And could I live back then when Virgil lived,;kirkpatrick
2;21;7679;101;I would agree to pass, beyond the due;kirkpatrick
2;21;7680;102;that brought me out of exile, one year’s sun.’;kirkpatrick
2;21;7681;103;These words turned Virgil round to me – his look;kirkpatrick
2;21;7682;104;saying, unspeakingly: ‘Be silent now!’;kirkpatrick
2;21;7683;105;But will power can’t do everything it wills.;kirkpatrick
2;21;7684;106;For tears and laughter follow on so close;kirkpatrick
2;21;7685;107;to those emotions from which each act springs;kirkpatrick
2;21;7686;108;that these least follow will in those most true.;kirkpatrick
2;21;7687;109;And so I smiled, as though to give a hint.;kirkpatrick
2;21;7688;110;At which the shade fell silent and just stared, straight in;kirkpatrick
2;21;7689;111;my eyes where what we feel shows most.;kirkpatrick
2;21;7690;112;‘I wish that all your toil may come to good;kirkpatrick
2;21;7691;113;Why did your features, though, display to me;kirkpatrick
2;21;7692;114;just now,’ he said, ‘that sudden ﬂashing smile?’;kirkpatrick
2;21;7693;115;So I was caught on this side and on that.;kirkpatrick
2;21;7694;116;One urges silence while the other calls;kirkpatrick
2;21;7695;117;for words from me. I sigh. I’m understood;kirkpatrick
2;21;7696;118;by him, my teacher. ‘Do not fear to speak.;kirkpatrick
2;21;7697;119;Speak out,’ he said to me, ‘and tell him all;kirkpatrick
2;21;7698;120;that he so urgently desires to know.’;kirkpatrick
2;21;7699;121;At which, ‘You ancient spirit,’ I began,;kirkpatrick
2;21;7700;122;you’re wondering maybe why you see me smile.;kirkpatrick
2;21;7701;123;I’d have you gripped with yet more wonderment.;kirkpatrick
2;21;7702;124;The one who guides my eyes towards the heights;kirkpatrick
2;21;7703;125;is that same Virgil that you drew upon;kirkpatrick
2;21;7704;126;to sing so strong of deities and men.;kirkpatrick
2;21;7705;127;If you suppose I’d other cause to smile,;kirkpatrick
2;21;7706;128;put that aside. It is not true. And think;kirkpatrick
2;21;7707;129;those words you spoke of him were cause enough.’;kirkpatrick
2;21;7708;130;He’d bowed at once to clasp my teacher’s feet.;kirkpatrick
2;21;7709;131;But he, in that embrace, said: ‘Brother, don’t!;kirkpatrick
2;21;7710;132;You are a shadow and you see a shade.’;kirkpatrick
2;21;7711;133;And he, in rising: ‘Now you grasp how great;kirkpatrick
2;21;7712;134;the love that warms my heart for you must be,;kirkpatrick
2;21;7713;135;when I dismiss from mind our emptiness,;kirkpatrick
2;21;7714;136;treating a shadow as a thing of weight.’;kirkpatrick
2;22;7715;1;The angel had by now been left behind –;kirkpatrick
2;22;7716;2;that angel who had turned us to Gyre Six,;kirkpatrick
2;22;7717;3;once having shaved my brow of one more wound.;kirkpatrick
2;22;7718;4;Those souls who thirst for justice he had named;kirkpatrick
2;22;7719;5;as ‘blessed’. His words as far as ‘sitiunt’ –;kirkpatrick
2;22;7720;6;but not beyond that verse – had ﬁlled this out.;kirkpatrick
2;22;7721;7;And, ﬂowing lighter than through other bays,;kirkpatrick
2;22;7722;8;I went along and, free from any toil,;kirkpatrick
2;22;7723;9;followed those rapid spirits on their way.;kirkpatrick
2;22;7724;10;Virgil, meanwhile, began to speak: ‘Pure love,;kirkpatrick
2;22;7725;11;provided that its ﬂame shows outwardly,;kirkpatrick
2;22;7726;12;kindled in virtue, kindles answering love.;kirkpatrick
2;22;7727;13;So, from the time that Juvenal came down;kirkpatrick
2;22;7728;14;to dwell among us on the fringe of Hell,;kirkpatrick
2;22;7729;15;and made your feeling for me plain to see,;kirkpatrick
2;22;7730;16;my own good will to you has gripped me more;kirkpatrick
2;22;7731;17;than any for a person yet unseen.;kirkpatrick
2;22;7732;18;These stairs will seem, then, short for me to climb.;kirkpatrick
2;22;7733;19;But tell me – and, in friendship, pardon this,;kirkpatrick
2;22;7734;20;if too much conﬁdence sets free my reins –;kirkpatrick
2;22;7735;21;and speak with me as friendship now permits:;kirkpatrick
2;22;7736;22;how could it be that in your breast, so full;kirkpatrick
2;22;7737;23;of all the wisdom that your learning won,;kirkpatrick
2;22;7738;24;a place was found for avarice as well?’;kirkpatrick
2;22;7739;25;Statius, on hearing this, was moved to smile;kirkpatrick
2;22;7740;26;(a little, anyway), but then replied:;kirkpatrick
2;22;7741;27;‘As marks of love, I value all your words.;kirkpatrick
2;22;7742;28;It’s true, though, that the way things often look;kirkpatrick
2;22;7743;29;provides false substance for our searching doubts, the real;kirkpatrick
2;22;7744;30;considerations lying hid.;kirkpatrick
2;22;7745;31;Your question veriﬁes that you believe –;kirkpatrick
2;22;7746;32;viewing, perhaps, the circle where I was –;kirkpatrick
2;22;7747;33;that I was “grasping” in the other life.;kirkpatrick
2;22;7748;34;Please understand that avarice, for me,;kirkpatrick
2;22;7749;35;ran too far oﬀ. My own extreme – the opposite –;kirkpatrick
2;22;7750;36;was punished over many thousand moons.;kirkpatrick
2;22;7751;37;Had I not set my spending urge to rights,;kirkpatrick
2;22;7752;38;and seen the meaning of the line you shout;kirkpatrick
2;22;7753;39;in, almost, agony at human ways:;kirkpatrick
2;22;7754;40;“You, awestruck hungering for gold! Why not;kirkpatrick
2;22;7755;41;impose a rule on mortal appetite?”;kirkpatrick
2;22;7756;42;I’d feel the rumbling turns of that grim duel.;kirkpatrick
2;22;7757;43;With that, I realized our hands can wing;kirkpatrick
2;22;7758;44;too openly in wild expense, and so;kirkpatrick
2;22;7759;45;for that repented, as for all my sins.;kirkpatrick
2;22;7760;46;How many will rise up with hair cropped short;kirkpatrick
2;22;7761;47;through ignorance of vice, which takes away;kirkpatrick
2;22;7762;48;repentance while we live, or at life’s end.;kirkpatrick
2;22;7763;49;Know, too, the guilt that butts at any sin,;kirkpatrick
2;22;7764;50;directly counter to that ﬁrst oﬀence,;kirkpatrick
2;22;7765;51;is drained here, with it, of its rampant green.;kirkpatrick
2;22;7766;52;And so, if I have been (to purge my sins);kirkpatrick
2;22;7767;53;among those men who weep for avarice,;kirkpatrick
2;22;7768;54;this came my way by rule of contraries.’;kirkpatrick
2;22;7769;55;‘When ﬁrst you sang of vicious wars between;kirkpatrick
2;22;7770;56;the twofold sadness that Jocasta bore,’;kirkpatrick
2;22;7771;57;so said the singer of the farming songs,;kirkpatrick
2;22;7772;58;‘to read the notes that Clio strikes from you,;kirkpatrick
2;22;7773;59;it does not seem that you had then become;kirkpatrick
2;22;7774;60;faithful in faith – without which good must fail.;kirkpatrick
2;22;7775;61;If that is so, what sun or candlelight;kirkpatrick
2;22;7776;62;dispelled your shadows so that you could set;kirkpatrick
2;22;7777;63;your sails to track the ﬁsherman aright?’;kirkpatrick
2;22;7778;64;‘You,’ he replied, ‘ﬁrst beckoned me to drink;kirkpatrick
2;22;7779;65;from springs that rise in high Parnassian glades.;kirkpatrick
2;22;7780;66;And you ﬁrst lit the way for me to God.;kirkpatrick
2;22;7781;67;You acted then like someone who, at night,;kirkpatrick
2;22;7782;68;bears at his back a lamp – no use to him,;kirkpatrick
2;22;7783;69;but teaching those the way who come behind;kirkpatrick
2;22;7784;70;when once you said: “The years begin anew,;kirkpatrick
2;22;7785;71;justice returns, so, too, Man’s earliest time.;kirkpatrick
2;22;7786;72;A new race, born of Heaven, now descends.”;kirkpatrick
2;22;7787;73;I was, through you, a poet and was Christian, too.;kirkpatrick
2;22;7788;74;But, so you’ll better see what I intend,;kirkpatrick
2;22;7789;75;I’ll stretch my hand to colour in this sketch.;kirkpatrick
2;22;7790;76;The world, by then, was pregnant, all entire,;kirkpatrick
2;22;7791;77;with true belief – an understanding sown;kirkpatrick
2;22;7792;78;by messengers of God’s eternal realm.;kirkpatrick
2;22;7793;79;And your words (which were touched on just above);kirkpatrick
2;22;7794;80;sang, with new preachers, to a single tune.;kirkpatrick
2;22;7795;81;I therefore took to visiting these men.;kirkpatrick
2;22;7796;82;And these soon came to seem to me such saints;kirkpatrick
2;22;7797;83;that, when Domitian’s persecution struck;kirkpatrick
2;22;7798;84;their weeping did not lack for my own tears.;kirkpatrick
2;22;7799;85;And while on earth I lived my given time,;kirkpatrick
2;22;7800;86;I aided them. And their right-thinking ways;kirkpatrick
2;22;7801;87;made me look down on other cults in scorn.;kirkpatrick
2;22;7802;88;Even before, in verse, I’d led the Greeks;kirkpatrick
2;22;7803;89;to drink the Theban stream, I’d been baptized,;kirkpatrick
2;22;7804;90;but still, from fear, concealed my Christian faith,;kirkpatrick
2;22;7805;91;displaying all that time a pagan face.;kirkpatrick
2;22;7806;92;And this luke-warmness made me circle round;kirkpatrick
2;22;7807;93;more than four hundred years on Terrace Four.;kirkpatrick
2;22;7808;94;But tell me – you who lifted up the veil;kirkpatrick
2;22;7809;95;that hid from me the good of which I speak –;kirkpatrick
2;22;7810;96;while still some way remains for us to climb,;kirkpatrick
2;22;7811;97;where, if you know, is ancient Terence now?;kirkpatrick
2;22;7812;98;Plautus, Cecilius and Varro, too?;kirkpatrick
2;22;7813;99;Tell me if these are damned, and where they walk.’;kirkpatrick
2;22;7814;100;‘All these, and Persius,’ my leader said,;kirkpatrick
2;22;7815;101;‘myself and more are there beside that Greek;kirkpatrick
2;22;7816;102;who, more than all, the Muses fed with milk,;kirkpatrick
2;22;7817;103;within Ring One of that unseeing gaol.;kirkpatrick
2;22;7818;104;And many times we speak of that great peak;kirkpatrick
2;22;7819;105;which always keeps our nurses on its slopes.;kirkpatrick
2;22;7820;106;Euripides is with us, Antiphon,;kirkpatrick
2;22;7821;107;Simonides and Agathon, and Greeks;kirkpatrick
2;22;7822;108;who crowned their brows with laurels, many more.;kirkpatrick
2;22;7823;109;And seen there, too (all named within your verse),;kirkpatrick
2;22;7824;110;Deiphile, Antigone and Argia,;kirkpatrick
2;22;7825;111;Ismene also, grieving as she did.;kirkpatrick
2;22;7826;112;She, too, is seen who spied out Langia’s stream.;kirkpatrick
2;22;7827;113;The daughter of Tiresias is there,;kirkpatrick
2;22;7828;114;Thetis and, with her sisters, Deidamia.’;kirkpatrick
2;22;7829;115;The poets both fell silent and, anew,;kirkpatrick
2;22;7830;116;free from the climb and tight surrounds of wall,;kirkpatrick
2;22;7831;117;gave all their thoughts to looking round about.;kirkpatrick
2;22;7832;118;Already, of the handmaids of the sun;kirkpatrick
2;22;7833;119;four were behind. The ﬁfth was at the pole,;kirkpatrick
2;22;7834;120;stretching its burning point towards the height.;kirkpatrick
2;22;7835;121;My leader now: ‘I think that we should turn;kirkpatrick
2;22;7836;122;our right sides to the far extremity,;kirkpatrick
2;22;7837;123;and circle round the mount, as we are wont.’;kirkpatrick
2;22;7838;124;So habit was the ﬂag we followed there.;kirkpatrick
2;22;7839;125;We took the chosen path with lesser doubt;kirkpatrick
2;22;7840;126;since that most worthy soul gave his assent.;kirkpatrick
2;22;7841;127;They made their way, I all alone behind.;kirkpatrick
2;22;7842;128;And as we went, I listened to their talk –;kirkpatrick
2;22;7843;129;which made me see what writing verse can mean.;kirkpatrick
2;22;7844;130;But then (a sudden break to soothing words!);kirkpatrick
2;22;7845;131;we found there, in the middle of the road,;kirkpatrick
2;22;7846;132;a tree – its fruits, in perfume, good and sweet.;kirkpatrick
2;22;7847;133;As ﬁr trees rise and lessen, by degrees,;kirkpatrick
2;22;7848;134;from branch to branch, so this – but lessening down ,;kirkpatrick
2;22;7849;135;lest anyone, I’d say, should try to climb.;kirkpatrick
2;22;7850;136;And, to the side, where rock walls closed our path,;kirkpatrick
2;22;7851;137;clear liquids streaming oﬀ the towering cliﬀ;kirkpatrick
2;22;7852;138;sprinkled across the surface of the leaves.;kirkpatrick
2;22;7853;139;Both poets now drew nearer to that tree,;kirkpatrick
2;22;7854;140;and then, within its leaves, a voice cried out:;kirkpatrick
2;22;7855;141;‘Of this dear food you’ll know the bitter dearth.’;kirkpatrick
2;22;7856;142;And then it said: ‘Maria thought far more;kirkpatrick
2;22;7857;143;of how the wedding might be full and ﬁne;kirkpatrick
2;22;7858;144;than of that mouth by which she prays for you.;kirkpatrick
2;22;7859;145;And Roman women were, in ancient times,;kirkpatrick
2;22;7860;146;content to drink plain water. Daniel, too,;kirkpatrick
2;22;7861;147;despising food, gained greatly in true thought.;kirkpatrick
2;22;7862;148;The primal age – as lovely, once, as gold –;kirkpatrick
2;22;7863;149;made acorns, through long fasting, good to taste, and,;kirkpatrick
2;22;7864;150;thirsting, nectar of each rivulet.;kirkpatrick
2;22;7865;151;Honey and locust were the nourishment;kirkpatrick
2;22;7866;152;that fed the Baptist in the wilderness.;kirkpatrick
2;22;7867;153;How glorious and great he is, for that;kirkpatrick
2;22;7868;154;is made quite clear in the Evangelist.’;kirkpatrick
2;23;7869;1;While I, through these green boughs, ﬁxed searching sight;kirkpatrick
2;23;7870;2;(as might some hunter tracking little birds,;kirkpatrick
2;23;7871;3;who spends his life in vain on that pursuit),;kirkpatrick
2;23;7872;4;my more-than-father spoke. ‘Dear son,’ he said,;kirkpatrick
2;23;7873;5;‘do come along. The time appointed us;kirkpatrick
2;23;7874;6;should be more usefully divided out.’;kirkpatrick
2;23;7875;7;I turned my eyes (my footsteps came as fast);kirkpatrick
2;23;7876;8;to track that learned pair, who, talking on,;kirkpatrick
2;23;7877;9;made going with them free, for me, of cost.;kirkpatrick
2;23;7878;10;And then, just look! Both tears and songs were heard –;kirkpatrick
2;23;7879;11;‘Labia mea, Domine’ , so tuned;kirkpatrick
2;23;7880;12;it brought both happiness and pain to birth.;kirkpatrick
2;23;7881;13;‘My sweetest father, what is this I hear?’;kirkpatrick
2;23;7882;14;so I began. And he: ‘These may be shades,;kirkpatrick
2;23;7883;15;who go unknotting what their debts have tied.’;kirkpatrick
2;23;7884;16;As pilgrims do when, deep in thought, they meet;kirkpatrick
2;23;7885;17;a group along their path that they don’t know;kirkpatrick
2;23;7886;18;and, though they turn towards it, still don’t stop,  so,;kirkpatrick
2;23;7887;19;now, behind us, moving with more speed,;kirkpatrick
2;23;7888;20;a throng of spirits, silent and devout,;kirkpatrick
2;23;7889;21;reaching and overtaking us, gazed back.;kirkpatrick
2;23;7890;22;Each one was dark and hollow round the eyes,;kirkpatrick
2;23;7891;23;pallid in feature, and so gaunt and waste;kirkpatrick
2;23;7892;24;their skin was formed to show the very bone.;kirkpatrick
2;23;7893;25;Erysichthon, as I can well believe,;kirkpatrick
2;23;7894;26;was not so dry and shrivelled round his rind;kirkpatrick
2;23;7895;27;when, hungering, his dread was at its height.;kirkpatrick
2;23;7896;28;And I, in thought, was saying to myself,;kirkpatrick
2;23;7897;29;‘Just look! The folk who lost Jerusalem;kirkpatrick
2;23;7898;30;when starving Mary pecked her son to death.;kirkpatrick
2;23;7899;31;The sockets of their eyes seemed gemless rings,;kirkpatrick
2;23;7900;32;and those who read Man’s ‘OMO’ in Man’s face;kirkpatrick
2;23;7901;33;would clearly have seen ‘M’ in all of these.;kirkpatrick
2;23;7902;34;Who would have thought the scent of some mere fruit;kirkpatrick
2;23;7903;35;could work to make a craving grow like this,;kirkpatrick
2;23;7904;36;and water, too – unless he knew the ‘how’.;kirkpatrick
2;23;7905;37;Already wondering what starved them so,;kirkpatrick
2;23;7906;38;I saw no reason that could well explain;kirkpatrick
2;23;7907;39;such thinness and those dreadful scales of skin.;kirkpatrick
2;23;7908;40;Then, look! A shadow turned its eyes on me,;kirkpatrick
2;23;7909;41;deep in its skull, and, peering ﬁxedly,;kirkpatrick
2;23;7910;42;cried out aloud: ‘For me, how great a grace!’;kirkpatrick
2;23;7911;43;I never would have known him from his face.;kirkpatrick
2;23;7912;44;But in his voice, all now was shown to me;kirkpatrick
2;23;7913;45;that had, in feature, been destroyed and lost.;kirkpatrick
2;23;7914;46;That spark for me rekindled at a stroke;kirkpatrick
2;23;7915;47;clear recognition of those much-changed lips,;kirkpatrick
2;23;7916;48;and once again I saw Forese’s face.;kirkpatrick
2;23;7917;49;‘Don’t boggle so to see these dried-up scabs,;kirkpatrick
2;23;7918;50;which drain the colour from my skin,’ he begged,;kirkpatrick
2;23;7919;51;‘nor that I have so great a lack of ﬂesh.;kirkpatrick
2;23;7920;52;But speak and tell the truth about yourself,;kirkpatrick
2;23;7921;53;and who these two souls are that act as guides.;kirkpatrick
2;23;7922;54;Don’t stand there, holding back the spark of words.’;kirkpatrick
2;23;7923;55;‘That face of yours I wept for once in death;kirkpatrick
2;23;7924;56;now gives me,’ I replied, ‘as painfully,;kirkpatrick
2;23;7925;57;a cause to weep, seeing it here so wrenched awry.;kirkpatrick
2;23;7926;58;But tell me, in God’s name, what strips your leaves?;kirkpatrick
2;23;7927;59;Don’t make me, wonderstruck, attempt to talk.;kirkpatrick
2;23;7928;60;No one, desiring other things, speaks well.’;kirkpatrick
2;23;7929;61;‘There falls,’ he said, ‘from the Eternal Mind;kirkpatrick
2;23;7930;62;a virtue in that water and that tree –;kirkpatrick
2;23;7931;63;back there – which sharpens me and pares me down.;kirkpatrick
2;23;7932;64;And all these people, weeping as they sing,;kirkpatrick
2;23;7933;65;because their gullets led them past all norms,;kirkpatrick
2;23;7934;66;are here remade as holy, thirsting, hungering.;kirkpatrick
2;23;7935;67;Cravings to eat and drink are ﬁred in us;kirkpatrick
2;23;7936;68;by perfumes from that fruit and from the spray;kirkpatrick
2;23;7937;69;that spreads in fans above the greenery.;kirkpatrick
2;23;7938;70;Nor once alone, in circling round this space,;kirkpatrick
2;23;7939;71;is agony and pain refreshed in us.;kirkpatrick
2;23;7940;72;I call it pain. Rightly, I should say solace.;kirkpatrick
2;23;7941;73;For that same yearning leads us to the tree;kirkpatrick
2;23;7942;74;that led Christ, in his joy, to say “Elì” ,;kirkpatrick
2;23;7943;75;when through his open veins he made us free.’;kirkpatrick
2;23;7944;76;And I to him: ‘Forese, from that day;kirkpatrick
2;23;7945;77;that you exchanged your world for better life,;kirkpatrick
2;23;7946;78;no more than ﬁve years have, till now, gone by.;kirkpatrick
2;23;7947;79;If your capacity to sin was dead;kirkpatrick
2;23;7948;80;before there came to you that holy hour;kirkpatrick
2;23;7949;81;of penance that remarries souls to God,;kirkpatrick
2;23;7950;82;how can it be that you’ve got here so quick?;kirkpatrick
2;23;7951;83;I thought that I should ﬁnd you there below,;kirkpatrick
2;23;7952;84;where restitution comes to time through time.’;kirkpatrick
2;23;7953;85;‘To drink sweet wormwood in this rightful pain;kirkpatrick
2;23;7954;86;I’m brought,’ he now replied, ‘so rapidly;kirkpatrick
2;23;7955;87;by broken tears that my dear Nella shed.;kirkpatrick
2;23;7956;88;With her devoted prayers and heartfelt sighs,;kirkpatrick
2;23;7957;89;she’s drawn me from that shore where spirits wait,;kirkpatrick
2;23;7958;90;and freed me from the other circles, too.;kirkpatrick
2;23;7959;91;My little widow, whom I loved so well,;kirkpatrick
2;23;7960;92;to God is dearer still, and better loved,;kirkpatrick
2;23;7961;93;since she so stands alone in doing good.;kirkpatrick
2;23;7962;94;For, as to womenfolk, Barbagian Sards;kirkpatrick
2;23;7963;95;are far more chaste and modest in their ways;kirkpatrick
2;23;7964;96;than is that Barbary I left her in.;kirkpatrick
2;23;7965;97;What, dearest brother, would you have me say?;kirkpatrick
2;23;7966;98;A future time, already in my sight,;kirkpatrick
2;23;7967;99;will come (when our time’s still not history),;kirkpatrick
2;23;7968;100;when, from the pulpit, there’ll be issued bans;kirkpatrick
2;23;7969;101;forbidding bare-faced Florence girls to go;kirkpatrick
2;23;7970;102;with blatant breasts and both their boobs on show.;kirkpatrick
2;23;7971;103;What mere barbarians or Saracens;kirkpatrick
2;23;7972;104;required a priest or threat of on-spot ﬁnes;kirkpatrick
2;23;7973;105;to make them cover up when they go out!;kirkpatrick
2;23;7974;106;If, though, these brazen creatures only guessed;kirkpatrick
2;23;7975;107;what Heaven so swiftly will bring down on them,;kirkpatrick
2;23;7976;108;then they’d already howl with open mouths.;kirkpatrick
2;23;7977;109;For if, foreseeing this, I’m not beguiled,;kirkpatrick
2;23;7978;110;they’ll come to grief before the cheek grows hair;kirkpatrick
2;23;7979;111;on any boy now rocked by lullabies.;kirkpatrick
2;23;7980;112;So, brother, don’t still hide yourself from me.;kirkpatrick
2;23;7981;113;You see? It’s all of us, not me alone,;kirkpatrick
2;23;7982;114;who gaze in wonder where you veil the sun.’;kirkpatrick
2;23;7983;115;‘If you bring back to mind,’ I now replied,;kirkpatrick
2;23;7984;116;‘what you were once to me and I to you,;kirkpatrick
2;23;7985;117;the memory of that will still be sore.;kirkpatrick
2;23;7986;118;I, from that life, was turned away by him;kirkpatrick
2;23;7987;119;who walks ahead of me the other day,;kirkpatrick
2;23;7988;120;when she, his sister’ (here I point the sun);kirkpatrick
2;23;7989;121;‘showed full and round. He, through the utmost depths;kirkpatrick
2;23;7990;122;of night and all the truly dead has been;kirkpatrick
2;23;7991;123;a guide to me, who follow in true ﬂesh.;kirkpatrick
2;23;7992;124;Now his encouragements have drawn me up,;kirkpatrick
2;23;7993;125;ascending here and circling all round;kirkpatrick
2;23;7994;126;this mount that straightens what the world distorts.;kirkpatrick
2;23;7995;127;He will, he says, be in my company;kirkpatrick
2;23;7996;128;until I’m there where Beatrice is.;kirkpatrick
2;23;7997;129;And when I am, I must then be without him.;kirkpatrick
2;23;7998;130;Virgil it is who tells me all of this.’;kirkpatrick
2;23;7999;131;(I point him out.) ‘That other is the shade;kirkpatrick
2;23;8000;132;for whom just now, in loosing him, your realm;kirkpatrick
2;23;8001;133;was shaken in its every slope and cliﬀ.’;kirkpatrick
2;24;8002;1;Our words did not slow down our steps (nor stride;kirkpatrick
2;24;8003;2;end speech). So on we went, talking apace,;kirkpatrick
2;24;8004;3;like ships when driven by a favouring wind.;kirkpatrick
2;24;8005;4;And all those shades, who looked like things twice dead,;kirkpatrick
2;24;8006;5;wondered – the sockets of their eyes dug out –;kirkpatrick
2;24;8007;6;as they looked on, to see me there alive.;kirkpatrick
2;24;8008;7;And I, continuing my former theme:;kirkpatrick
2;24;8009;8;‘Statius’s soul climbs slower than it would,;kirkpatrick
2;24;8010;9;perhaps by reason of another’s need.;kirkpatrick
2;24;8011;10;But tell me: where’s Piccarda – if you know?;kirkpatrick
2;24;8012;11;And tell me, too, among those souls who gaze;kirkpatrick
2;24;8013;12;at me, are any that I ought to note?’;kirkpatrick
2;24;8014;13;‘My sister (was she more – I do not know –;kirkpatrick
2;24;8015;14;in beauty than in goodness?) triumphs now,;kirkpatrick
2;24;8016;15;crowned on Olympian heights, in happiness.’;kirkpatrick
2;24;8017;16;This ﬁrst, and then he said: ‘Since we’re milked dry,;kirkpatrick
2;24;8018;17;by fasting, of the way that once we seemed,;kirkpatrick
2;24;8019;18;it’s not forbidden that we each be named.;kirkpatrick
2;24;8020;19;And this’ (he pointed out) ‘is Bonagiunta,;kirkpatrick
2;24;8021;20;Bonagiunta of Lucca. And, further on,;kirkpatrick
2;24;8022;21;that face more raddled than are all the rest;kirkpatrick
2;24;8023;22;held tight our Holy Church in his embrace.;kirkpatrick
2;24;8024;23;He came from Tours, and purges, by this fast,;kirkpatrick
2;24;8025;24;Bolsena eels and ﬂagons of vernaccia.’;kirkpatrick
2;24;8026;25;Then, one by one, he named me many more.;kirkpatrick
2;24;8027;26;And these, it seemed, were happy to be named.;kirkpatrick
2;24;8028;27;I got no dark looks from them when they were.;kirkpatrick
2;24;8029;28;I saw there, plying teeth on empty air,;kirkpatrick
2;24;8030;29;Ubaldin da la Pila and that Boniface;kirkpatrick
2;24;8031;30;who pastured many with his castled crook.;kirkpatrick
2;24;8032;31;I saw Sir Marquis, who had far more space;kirkpatrick
2;24;8033;32;to drink at Forlì (being far less parched),;kirkpatrick
2;24;8034;33;a man who never felt he’d had his ﬁll.;kirkpatrick
2;24;8035;34;But, as our glance will scan around then prize;kirkpatrick
2;24;8036;35;one above all, so I with that Lucchese –;kirkpatrick
2;24;8037;36;seeming the keenest to be known by me.;kirkpatrick
2;24;8038;37;And he, I heard, was murmuring – I don’t know…;kirkpatrick
2;24;8039;38;something: ‘Gentucca’? – where he felt the wound;kirkpatrick
2;24;8040;39;of justice as it plucked and nibbled him.;kirkpatrick
2;24;8041;40;‘You seem, dear soul, to long to speak with me.;kirkpatrick
2;24;8042;41;So make me understand your sense,’ I said,;kirkpatrick
2;24;8043;42;‘and, speaking, satisfy the two of us.’;kirkpatrick
2;24;8044;43;‘A woman’s born (not yet grown-up in dress)’;kirkpatrick
2;24;8045;44;(so he began) ‘who’ll make my native place;kirkpatrick
2;24;8046;45;a joy for you, although men talk it down.;kirkpatrick
2;24;8047;46;You’ll leave here carrying this prophecy.;kirkpatrick
2;24;8048;47;And if my murmurings made you mistake,;kirkpatrick
2;24;8049;48;then true events will make their meaning clear.;kirkpatrick
2;24;8050;49;But tell me: do I see the man who drew;kirkpatrick
2;24;8051;50;those new rhymes forth, whose opening line ran so:;kirkpatrick
2;24;8052;51;“Ladies, who have intelligence of love…”?’;kirkpatrick
2;24;8053;52;And I to him: ‘I am just one who, when;kirkpatrick
2;24;8054;53;Love breathes in me, takes note and then goes on;kirkpatrick
2;24;8055;54;showing the meaning that’s ordained within.’;kirkpatrick
2;24;8056;55;‘Dear brother, nah I see,’ he said, ‘the knot;kirkpatrick
2;24;8057;56;that kept the Brief, Guittone, me as well,;kirkpatrick
2;24;8058;57;from reaching to that sweet new style I hear of.;kirkpatrick
2;24;8059;58;I see how close behind the power that speaks;kirkpatrick
2;24;8060;59;your winged pens ﬂy, transcribing what he says –;kirkpatrick
2;24;8061;60;which certainly our own pens never did.;kirkpatrick
2;24;8062;61;Strive as you might to see, between our styles,;kirkpatrick
2;24;8063;62;some greater diﬀerence, you’ll not see it here.’;kirkpatrick
2;24;8064;63;And then, as though content, he said no more.;kirkpatrick
2;24;8065;64;As birds that pass their winters by the Nile;kirkpatrick
2;24;8066;65;will rise at times and gather on the air,;kirkpatrick
2;24;8067;66;then ﬂy, more rapidly, to form a line,;kirkpatrick
2;24;8068;67;so now the crowd of people who were there;kirkpatrick
2;24;8069;68;all turned their faces and increased their stride,;kirkpatrick
2;24;8070;69;light-footed, driven by desire (and thin!).;kirkpatrick
2;24;8071;70;And then, like someone tired of trotting on;kirkpatrick
2;24;8072;71;who lets the pack go by and takes his time;kirkpatrick
2;24;8073;72;until the heaving of his chest is done,;kirkpatrick
2;24;8074;73;Forese, too, now left the holy ﬂock.;kirkpatrick
2;24;8075;74;As these raced oﬀ, he followed in my track,;kirkpatrick
2;24;8076;75;saying: ‘So when shall I see you again?’;kirkpatrick
2;24;8077;76;‘How long I’ll live,’ I answered, ‘I don’t know.;kirkpatrick
2;24;8078;77;But my return will not be sooner than;kirkpatrick
2;24;8079;78;desire already brings me to this shore.;kirkpatrick
2;24;8080;79;For that place where it falls to me to live;kirkpatrick
2;24;8081;80;grows, day by day, less meaty as to good,;kirkpatrick
2;24;8082;81;and sets its mind on ruin and despair.’;kirkpatrick
2;24;8083;82;‘That’s right,’ he said. ‘I see who’s most to blame;kirkpatrick
2;24;8084;83;dragged at a horse’s tail towards the ditch;kirkpatrick
2;24;8085;84;where no one, ever, can be free of sin.;kirkpatrick
2;24;8086;85;That beast rampages faster with each step,;kirkpatrick
2;24;8087;86;accelerating always, till it strikes;kirkpatrick
2;24;8088;87;and leaves his broken corpse a mangled mess.;kirkpatrick
2;24;8089;88;Those wheels’ (he ﬁxed his eyes upon the stars);kirkpatrick
2;24;8090;89;‘have little left to run till you see clear;kirkpatrick
2;24;8091;90;the things that I, in words, cannot declare.;kirkpatrick
2;24;8092;91;You stay behind. For time is precious here.;kirkpatrick
2;24;8093;92;Coming along with you and keeping step,;kirkpatrick
2;24;8094;93;I, in this realm, already lose too much.’;kirkpatrick
2;24;8095;94;Knights gallop out at times from charging troops,;kirkpatrick
2;24;8096;95;intending, as they leave the rest behind,;kirkpatrick
2;24;8097;96;to claim the honours of an opening duel.;kirkpatrick
2;24;8098;97;So oﬀ he went from us at greater pace,;kirkpatrick
2;24;8099;98;and I remained, still travelling with those two;kirkpatrick
2;24;8100;99;who in the world were such great dignitaries.;kirkpatrick
2;24;8101;100;And when he’d gone so far ahead of us;kirkpatrick
2;24;8102;101;that eyesight strained to follow in his track;kirkpatrick
2;24;8103;102;(as did my mind to understand his words),;kirkpatrick
2;24;8104;103;there then appeared to me, ripe-branched and bright,;kirkpatrick
2;24;8105;104;a second fruit tree, not so far from us,;kirkpatrick
2;24;8106;105;just there, around the bend that we’d now turned.;kirkpatrick
2;24;8107;106;Beneath, I saw a group that raised their hands;kirkpatrick
2;24;8108;107;and called towards the leaves I-don’t-know-what,;kirkpatrick
2;24;8109;108;like silly, over-eager little tots,;kirkpatrick
2;24;8110;109;who plead – although their target won’t respond;kirkpatrick
2;24;8111;110;but rather seeks to whet their appetite,;kirkpatrick
2;24;8112;111;dangling, unhidden, what they want aloft.;kirkpatrick
2;24;8113;112;Then oﬀ they went (as though they’d changed their;kirkpatrick
2;24;8114;113;minds).;kirkpatrick
2;24;8115;114;And we ourselves arrived at that great tree;kirkpatrick
2;24;8116;115;which turned aside so many tears and prayers.;kirkpatrick
2;24;8117;116;‘Move further on, and don’t get drawn to that.;kirkpatrick
2;24;8118;117;There’s, higher up, the tree that Eve once bit.;kirkpatrick
2;24;8119;118;This tree is raised from it, and ﬂourishes.’;kirkpatrick
2;24;8120;119;Someone – I don’t know who – among its sprigs;kirkpatrick
2;24;8121;120;spoke this. So Virgil, Statius and myself;kirkpatrick
2;24;8122;121;closed ranks, to pass by on the rising side.;kirkpatrick
2;24;8123;122;‘Recall those curséd ones,’ the voice went on,;kirkpatrick
2;24;8124;123;‘the centaurs, formed from cloud, who once, when gorged,;kirkpatrick
2;24;8125;124;fought against Theseus with doubled chests.;kirkpatrick
2;24;8126;125;Recall those Hebrews, softened so by drink;kirkpatrick
2;24;8127;126;that Gideon would not take them in his ranks;kirkpatrick
2;24;8128;127;when he swept down on Midian from the hills.’;kirkpatrick
2;24;8129;128;So, tightly pressed against the near-side verge,;kirkpatrick
2;24;8130;129;we passed along and heard how sins of greed;kirkpatrick
2;24;8131;130;were followed once by miserable rewards.;kirkpatrick
2;24;8132;131;Then, broadening out, we found an empty road.;kirkpatrick
2;24;8133;132;A thousand paces bore us on (and more),;kirkpatrick
2;24;8134;133;each of us silent, each contemplative.;kirkpatrick
2;24;8135;134;‘And what are you three thinking as you go?’;kirkpatrick
2;24;8136;135;A sudden voice said this – at which I shied;kirkpatrick
2;24;8137;136;in terror like an untamed animal.;kirkpatrick
2;24;8138;137;I raised my head to see who this might be.;kirkpatrick
2;24;8139;138;And in no furnace was there ever seen;kirkpatrick
2;24;8140;139;metal or glass that glowed as bright and red;kirkpatrick
2;24;8141;140;as now I saw one, saying: ‘If you wish;kirkpatrick
2;24;8142;141;to get up there, then here’s where you must turn.;kirkpatrick
2;24;8143;142;All seeking peace are bound to take this path.’;kirkpatrick
2;24;8144;143;The blazing face had robbed me of my sight.;kirkpatrick
2;24;8145;144;And so behind my teachers I went on;kirkpatrick
2;24;8146;145;as someone will when led by what he hears.;kirkpatrick
2;24;8147;146;And as the breeze in May – ﬁrst messenger;kirkpatrick
2;24;8148;147;of whitening dawn – is moved in fragrant waves,;kirkpatrick
2;24;8149;148;pregnant with grasses, greenery and ﬂowers,;kirkpatrick
2;24;8150;149;so here I sensed, mid-brow, wind touching me,;kirkpatrick
2;24;8151;150;and sensed the moving feathers of a wing;kirkpatrick
2;24;8152;151;that brought ambrosial senses to the air,;kirkpatrick
2;24;8153;152;and made me sense the words: ‘The truly blessed;kirkpatrick
2;24;8154;153;are lit with so much grace that in their hearts;kirkpatrick
2;24;8155;154;a love of food fumes forth no false desire,;kirkpatrick
2;24;8156;155;esurient always for the good and true.’;kirkpatrick
2;25;8157;1;The hour would not allow a crippled climb.;kirkpatrick
2;25;8158;2;The sun had now abandoned to the Bull;kirkpatrick
2;25;8159;3;its noon-time ring, and night to Scorpio.;kirkpatrick
2;25;8160;4;And so, like people who will not stay put;kirkpatrick
2;25;8161;5;but, driven forward by some piercing need,;kirkpatrick
2;25;8162;6;go on, whatever comes before their eyes,;kirkpatrick
2;25;8163;7;so here we entered on a passageway;kirkpatrick
2;25;8164;8;(so narrow it uncouples those who climb),;kirkpatrick
2;25;8165;9;clambering in single ﬁle to mount the stair.;kirkpatrick
2;25;8166;10;Compare: a ﬂedgling stork will lift its wings.;kirkpatrick
2;25;8167;11;It wants to ﬂy but still dares not attempt;kirkpatrick
2;25;8168;12;to leave the nest, so sinks back down again.;kirkpatrick
2;25;8169;13;That was me, too – the urge to ask, alight;kirkpatrick
2;25;8170;14;and yet snuﬀed out, arriving at the look;kirkpatrick
2;25;8171;15;(no more) of someone who intends to speak.;kirkpatrick
2;25;8172;16;My dearest father, though the pace was quick,;kirkpatrick
2;25;8173;17;did not hold back, but said: ‘Let loose your bow.;kirkpatrick
2;25;8174;18;You’ve drawn that arrow to its iron tip.’;kirkpatrick
2;25;8175;19;Now, conﬁdent, I opened up my lips.;kirkpatrick
2;25;8176;20;‘Where there’s no need for nourishment,’ I said, ‘how can;kirkpatrick
2;25;8177;21;it be that people get so thin?’;kirkpatrick
2;25;8178;22;‘Were you to call to mind how Meleager –;kirkpatrick
2;25;8179;23;a log consumed by ﬁre – consumed himself,;kirkpatrick
2;25;8180;24;then this,’ he said, ‘would not seem sour to you.;kirkpatrick
2;25;8181;25;And if you thought how, when you writhe around,;kirkpatrick
2;25;8182;26;your image in a mirror also writhes,;kirkpatrick
2;25;8183;27;what seems so hard would seem a hoary truth.;kirkpatrick
2;25;8184;28;To make you, though, at ease in your desires,;kirkpatrick
2;25;8185;29;Statius is here, look. I now call on him,;kirkpatrick
2;25;8186;30;begging he be the healer of your wounds.’;kirkpatrick
2;25;8187;31;Statius responded: ‘If, for him, I free –;kirkpatrick
2;25;8188;32;with you still here – a vista of eternity,;kirkpatrick
2;25;8189;33;let this be my excuse: I can’t say no.’;kirkpatrick
2;25;8190;34;He then began: ‘My son, if in your mind;kirkpatrick
2;25;8191;35;you gather up and guard my words to you,;kirkpatrick
2;25;8192;36;they’ll be a light that shows the “how” you seek.;kirkpatrick
2;25;8193;37;Pure, perfect blood – which never will be drunk;kirkpatrick
2;25;8194;38;by thirsting veins – remains behind untouched,;kirkpatrick
2;25;8195;39;as might some dish that’s carried from the feast,  and;kirkpatrick
2;25;8196;40;gains there, in the heart, a power to mould;kirkpatrick
2;25;8197;41;the limbs and organs of new embryos –;kirkpatrick
2;25;8198;42;as blood runs through our veins to form our own.;kirkpatrick
2;25;8199;43;This blood, distilled as sperm, descends to where;kirkpatrick
2;25;8200;44;(more decent not to say) its droplets run;kirkpatrick
2;25;8201;45;within the natural cup to other blood.;kirkpatrick
2;25;8202;46;These two bloods meet and gather, each with each.;kirkpatrick
2;25;8203;47;Menstrum is passive. But the other acts –;kirkpatrick
2;25;8204;48;the perfect place it’s pressed from causes that –  and,;kirkpatrick
2;25;8205;49;once arrived, begins to do its work,;kirkpatrick
2;25;8206;50;ﬁrst to coagulate, and then to bring;kirkpatrick
2;25;8207;51;the matter that it ﬁrst made dense to life.;kirkpatrick
2;25;8208;52;The active virtue, which is now a soul,;kirkpatrick
2;25;8209;53;much like a plant (though diﬀering in this point, that plant;kirkpatrick
2;25;8210;54;souls stay as plants while this moves on),  continues;kirkpatrick
2;25;8211;55;in its work, to move and feel,;kirkpatrick
2;25;8212;56;as do aquatic sponges, then begins;kirkpatrick
2;25;8213;57;to form the organs for the powers it seeds.;kirkpatrick
2;25;8214;58;And now, my dearest son, the power that ﬂows;kirkpatrick
2;25;8215;59;out of the father’s heart (where nature plans;kirkpatrick
2;25;8216;60;for every organ) stretching, spreads to all.;kirkpatrick
2;25;8217;61;This creature will become a speaking child.;kirkpatrick
2;25;8218;62;Yet how , you don’t yet see. And this same point;kirkpatrick
2;25;8219;63;led someone far more wise than you astray,;kirkpatrick
2;25;8220;64;who in his teachings set the soul apart;kirkpatrick
2;25;8221;65;from intellectus as possibilis ,;kirkpatrick
2;25;8222;66;ﬁnding no organ taken up by that.;kirkpatrick
2;25;8223;67;Open your heart. Receive the coming truth.;kirkpatrick
2;25;8224;68;Know this: when once the foetal brain is brought to full;kirkpatrick
2;25;8225;69;articulation in the womb,;kirkpatrick
2;25;8226;70;the Primal Cause of Motion turns in joy;kirkpatrick
2;25;8227;71;to see so much of Nature’s art, and breathes;kirkpatrick
2;25;8228;72;new breath of spirit ﬁlled with power within,;kirkpatrick
2;25;8229;73;which draws all active elements it ﬁnds;kirkpatrick
2;25;8230;74;into its being and thus forms one soul;kirkpatrick
2;25;8231;75;which lives and feels and turns as conscious self.;kirkpatrick
2;25;8232;76;And – so you’ll wonder less at what I say –;kirkpatrick
2;25;8233;77;look at how solar warmth transforms to wine;kirkpatrick
2;25;8234;78;when joined with juices ﬂowing from the grape.;kirkpatrick
2;25;8235;79;And when Lachesis cannot spin more thread,;kirkpatrick
2;25;8236;80;the soul leaves ﬂesh and carries, by its power, both;kirkpatrick
2;25;8237;81;human and divine along with it.;kirkpatrick
2;25;8238;82;But memory, intelligence and will,;kirkpatrick
2;25;8239;83;since all the other powers are silent now,;kirkpatrick
2;25;8240;84;become, in act, much keener than before.;kirkpatrick
2;25;8241;85;Unrestingly, it falls, by its own will –;kirkpatrick
2;25;8242;86;a miracle! – on one of these two shores,;kirkpatrick
2;25;8243;87;and here ﬁrst knows the paths it has to take.;kirkpatrick
2;25;8244;88;As soon as it is circumscribed by place,;kirkpatrick
2;25;8245;89;the power that forms it radiates around;kirkpatrick
2;25;8246;90;in size and shape as in its living limbs.;kirkpatrick
2;25;8247;91;And as the air, when drenched with vaporous rain,;kirkpatrick
2;25;8248;92;is soon adorned with many diﬀerent hues,;kirkpatrick
2;25;8249;93;from other rays reﬂected in the haze,;kirkpatrick
2;25;8250;94;so when the soul has reached this point of rest,;kirkpatrick
2;25;8251;95;the air around it gathers in the form;kirkpatrick
2;25;8252;96;that virtual powers of soul impress on it.;kirkpatrick
2;25;8253;97;And, as some little ﬂame pursues the ﬁre;kirkpatrick
2;25;8254;98;and follows where its changing heat may lead,;kirkpatrick
2;25;8255;99;so this new form will go where spirit goes.;kirkpatrick
2;25;8256;100;And since in this way soul appears to view,;kirkpatrick
2;25;8257;101;that’s called soul’s shade. And from this there will form;kirkpatrick
2;25;8258;102;the organs of all sense, including sight.;kirkpatrick
2;25;8259;103;And that is how we speak and how we laugh,;kirkpatrick
2;25;8260;104;and how we form our tears and all those sighs;kirkpatrick
2;25;8261;105;that you may well have heard around this hill.;kirkpatrick
2;25;8262;106;As our desires and other feelings form,;kirkpatrick
2;25;8263;107;the shade accordingly conﬁgures them.;kirkpatrick
2;25;8264;108;And that’s the cause of what you wonder at.’;kirkpatrick
2;25;8265;109;Our path had brought us, turning to the right,;kirkpatrick
2;25;8266;110;to reach the ﬁnal twist of punishment,;kirkpatrick
2;25;8267;111;and we were now intent on new concerns.;kirkpatrick
2;25;8268;112;The bank here shot out blazing bolts of ﬂame.;kirkpatrick
2;25;8269;113;And round the edge there breathed an upward wind that;kirkpatrick
2;25;8270;114;bent these ﬂames back, keeping them at bay.;kirkpatrick
2;25;8271;115;So, one by one, we had to make our way;kirkpatrick
2;25;8272;116;along the unprotected outer rim.;kirkpatrick
2;25;8273;117;I feared the ﬁre there. Here I feared the fall.;kirkpatrick
2;25;8274;118;Meanwhile, my leader said: ‘In such a place;kirkpatrick
2;25;8275;119;we need to keep a strict check on our eyes.;kirkpatrick
2;25;8276;120;It wouldn’t be too hard for them to stray.’;kirkpatrick
2;25;8277;121;And then I heard: ‘Summae Deus clementiae’;kirkpatrick
2;25;8278;122;singing within the heart of that great blaze,;kirkpatrick
2;25;8279;123;which made me – no less watchfully – turn round.;kirkpatrick
2;25;8280;124;I saw there spirits walking in the ﬂames.;kirkpatrick
2;25;8281;125;At which I looked at both my steps and them,;kirkpatrick
2;25;8282;126;dividing my attentions, here then there.;kirkpatrick
2;25;8283;127;And, when the ending of the hymn had come,;kirkpatrick
2;25;8284;128;they cried aloud, ‘Virum non cognosco!’;kirkpatrick
2;25;8285;129;then, singing low, began the hymn again.;kirkpatrick
2;25;8286;130;That ﬁnished, they all cried once more: ‘Diana,;kirkpatrick
2;25;8287;131;guarding her woodlands, drove out Helice;kirkpatrick
2;25;8288;132;who’d felt what bitter poison Venus sends.’;kirkpatrick
2;25;8289;133;And yet again they now began their song,;kirkpatrick
2;25;8290;134;then called on men and women who were chaste –;kirkpatrick
2;25;8291;135;as virtue and our marriages demand.;kirkpatrick
2;25;8292;136;This form of song will serve for them, I think,;kirkpatrick
2;25;8293;137;throughout the time the ﬁre is scorching them.;kirkpatrick
2;25;8294;138;With this concern and fed by foods like this,;kirkpatrick
2;25;8295;139;sin’s ﬁnal wound is sewn up once again.;kirkpatrick
2;26;8296;1;While on, in single ﬁle, we went around;kirkpatrick
2;26;8297;2;the rim – my trusted teacher saying often:;kirkpatrick
2;26;8298;3;‘Careful! I’ll point the dangers out. Attend!’ –;kirkpatrick
2;26;8299;4;the sun was beating on my right-hand side,;kirkpatrick
2;26;8300;5;its rays illuminating all the west,;kirkpatrick
2;26;8301;6;changing its face from clearest blue to white.;kirkpatrick
2;26;8302;7;And I, in casting shadows on the ﬂame,;kirkpatrick
2;26;8303;8;made ﬁre seem ﬁerier. Then many shades,;kirkpatrick
2;26;8304;9;I saw, at that one hint, while walking on,;kirkpatrick
2;26;8305;10;gave thought, and came, because of that,;kirkpatrick
2;26;8306;11;to say of me their say. So they began:;kirkpatrick
2;26;8307;12;‘He does not seem, in body, ﬁction-formed.’;kirkpatrick
2;26;8308;13;And then, as far towards me as they could,;kirkpatrick
2;26;8309;14;they pressed to make quite sure – with constant care;kirkpatrick
2;26;8310;15;lest any come where they should not be burned.;kirkpatrick
2;26;8311;16;‘You there (who, following the other two,;kirkpatrick
2;26;8312;17;aren’t slow, maybe, but mean to show respect);kirkpatrick
2;26;8313;18;please answer me. I burn in ﬁre and thirst.;kirkpatrick
2;26;8314;19;Nor will your answer serve for me alone.;kirkpatrick
2;26;8315;20;For all of us are thirsting more for this;kirkpatrick
2;26;8316;21;than Ethiopes or Indians for cool streams.;kirkpatrick
2;26;8317;22;Tell us: how do you make yourself a wall;kirkpatrick
2;26;8318;23;to shield the sun, as if you had not yet;kirkpatrick
2;26;8319;24;entered within the trammels of death’s net?’;kirkpatrick
2;26;8320;25;These words from one of them. And I’d have said;kirkpatrick
2;26;8321;26;already who I was, except my mind;kirkpatrick
2;26;8322;27;was set on something new that now appeared.;kirkpatrick
2;26;8323;28;For down the middle of the blazing path,;kirkpatrick
2;26;8324;29;facing the ﬁrst, there came another group.;kirkpatrick
2;26;8325;30;This made me pause in answering, and gaze.;kirkpatrick
2;26;8326;31;I saw on either side the shadows kiss.;kirkpatrick
2;26;8327;32;They did not cease, however, in their course,;kirkpatrick
2;26;8328;33;each one content to keep the frolic brief.;kirkpatrick
2;26;8329;34;In that same way, within their darkening ranks,;kirkpatrick
2;26;8330;35;ants nuzzle other ants, when columns meet,;kirkpatrick
2;26;8331;36;to scout the road ahead or spy on fate.;kirkpatrick
2;26;8332;37;These friends, once parted from their warm embrace,;kirkpatrick
2;26;8333;38;before their forward steps can speed them on,;kirkpatrick
2;26;8334;39;strain, each one louder than the next, to yell;kirkpatrick
2;26;8335;40;(the new arrivals), ‘Sodom! Gomorrah!’;kirkpatrick
2;26;8336;41;‘Into the cow’ (the rest) ‘went Pasiphae;kirkpatrick
2;26;8337;42;to let the bull calf run his lust in her.’;kirkpatrick
2;26;8338;43;As ﬂocks of cranes divide – some ﬂying north;kirkpatrick
2;26;8339;44;to ﬁnd the Riphean steeps, while some seek sand;kirkpatrick
2;26;8340;45;"(the second can’t stand chill; the former, sun),";kirkpatrick
2;26;8341;46;one lot went oﬀ, the other went oﬀ, too,;kirkpatrick
2;26;8342;47;all turning, weeping, to their former song,;kirkpatrick
2;26;8343;48;each to the slogan that most suited them.;kirkpatrick
2;26;8344;49;Then those same souls who’d pleaded with me ﬁrst;kirkpatrick
2;26;8345;50;came to my side, as they had done before;kirkpatrick
2;26;8346;51;and, from the look of them, were keen to hear.;kirkpatrick
2;26;8347;52;And I (who’d now seen twice what they found good);kirkpatrick
2;26;8348;53;began: ‘You souls, quite certain to arrive –;kirkpatrick
2;26;8349;54;whenever that time comes – at perfect peace,;kirkpatrick
2;26;8350;55;my living limbs have not remained back there,;kirkpatrick
2;26;8351;56;not aged and ripe, nor youthful green. They’re here.;kirkpatrick
2;26;8352;57;They travel with me, blood and joints entire.;kirkpatrick
2;26;8353;58;I make this climb to be no longer blind.;kirkpatrick
2;26;8354;59;A lady up above besought this grace;kirkpatrick
2;26;8355;60;that through your world I bear my mortal part.;kirkpatrick
2;26;8356;61;Yet – may your greater longing soon be fed,;kirkpatrick
2;26;8357;62;so that you come to lodge at rest in Heaven,;kirkpatrick
2;26;8358;63;which, ranging wide and free, is full of peace –;kirkpatrick
2;26;8359;64;tell me, so I may rule a page for this,;kirkpatrick
2;26;8360;65;who might you be, and who’s within that crowd;kirkpatrick
2;26;8361;66;that’s going on its way behind your backs?’;kirkpatrick
2;26;8362;67;These shadows in appearance now all stood;kirkpatrick
2;26;8363;68;as mountain yokels stand – no diﬀerently –;kirkpatrick
2;26;8364;69;in dumbstruck stupefaction, staring round,;kirkpatrick
2;26;8365;70;when, red-necked, rough, they make it, ﬁrst, to town.;kirkpatrick
2;26;8366;71;But once they’d set astonishment aside;kirkpatrick
2;26;8367;72;(it’s quickly blunted in a noble heart),;kirkpatrick
2;26;8368;73;‘Blessèd be you, who round our border lands,’;kirkpatrick
2;26;8369;74;the shade who ﬁrst had questioned me began,;kirkpatrick
2;26;8370;75;‘haul in experience for your better death!;kirkpatrick
2;26;8371;76;Those folk who do not follow in our track;kirkpatrick
2;26;8372;77;oﬀended as did Caesar – who once heard;kirkpatrick
2;26;8373;78;“You queen!”, when triumphing, yelled out at him.;kirkpatrick
2;26;8374;79;Then they, as they depart, are crying, “Sodom!”;kirkpatrick
2;26;8375;80;to castigate themselves as you have heard,;kirkpatrick
2;26;8376;81;bringing self-shame to aid the scorching ﬁre.;kirkpatrick
2;26;8377;82;Our sin, by contrast, was hermaphrodite.;kirkpatrick
2;26;8378;83;And since we paid no heed to human law –;kirkpatrick
2;26;8379;84;choosing to follow bestial appetites –;kirkpatrick
2;26;8380;85;ourselves we read out our opprobrium,;kirkpatrick
2;26;8381;86;speaking, on leaving here, the name of one;kirkpatrick
2;26;8382;87;who made herself a beast in beastlike planks.;kirkpatrick
2;26;8383;88;So now you know our guilt and what we did.;kirkpatrick
2;26;8384;89;But if you seek to know us each by name,;kirkpatrick
2;26;8385;90;there is no time – and I don’t know them all.;kirkpatrick
2;26;8386;91;I shall diminish what you want of me.;kirkpatrick
2;26;8387;92;I’m Guido Guinizelli. Since I mourned;kirkpatrick
2;26;8388;93;my sins before my end, I’m here made clean.’;kirkpatrick
2;26;8389;94;Like those two sons, who, when Lycurgus grieved,;kirkpatrick
2;26;8390;95;were made to see their mother once again,;kirkpatrick
2;26;8391;96;so I became (though I don’t reach those heights),;kirkpatrick
2;26;8392;97;listening as now he named himself, the sire;kirkpatrick
2;26;8393;98;of me and all those (better men) who ever;kirkpatrick
2;26;8394;99;wrote about love in sweet and well-poised rhyme.;kirkpatrick
2;26;8395;100;Hearing and saying nothing, deep in thought,;kirkpatrick
2;26;8396;101;I walked a while, just marvelling at him,;kirkpatrick
2;26;8397;102;yet did not – since the ﬁre was there – draw near.;kirkpatrick
2;26;8398;103;Then, having pastured fully on that gaze,;kirkpatrick
2;26;8399;104;I gave myself entirely to his service,;kirkpatrick
2;26;8400;105;with gestures of the kind that win good faith.;kirkpatrick
2;26;8401;106;To me he said: ‘Through what I hear, you leave;kirkpatrick
2;26;8402;107;so clear a trace and footprint in my mind,;kirkpatrick
2;26;8403;108;Lethe won’t cancel it or make it fade.;kirkpatrick
2;26;8404;109;But, if the oath you took just now holds true,;kirkpatrick
2;26;8405;110;tell me, why is it that, in word and look,;kirkpatrick
2;26;8406;111;you show so frankly that you hold me dear?’;kirkpatrick
2;26;8407;112;And I to him: ‘That smooth, sweet verse you wrote;kirkpatrick
2;26;8408;113;will make its very ink most dearly prized;kirkpatrick
2;26;8409;114;as long as present usage still endures.’;kirkpatrick
2;26;8410;115;‘Brother,’ he said, ‘the one I single out’;kirkpatrick
2;26;8411;116;(his ﬁnger pointing to a soul ahead);kirkpatrick
2;26;8412;117;‘crafted the mother tongue with greater skill.;kirkpatrick
2;26;8413;118;Lyrics of love, in prose the French Romance –;kirkpatrick
2;26;8414;119;all these he far surpassed. Let idiots talk,;kirkpatrick
2;26;8415;120;rating that poet from Limoges ahead.;kirkpatrick
2;26;8416;121;Their gaze is turned to chatter more than truth.;kirkpatrick
2;26;8417;122;They settle their opinions long before;kirkpatrick
2;26;8418;123;reason or art is heard within their thoughts.;kirkpatrick
2;26;8419;124;That’s what they did with Fra Guittone once,;kirkpatrick
2;26;8420;125;proclaiming, on and on, his proven worth;kirkpatrick
2;26;8421;126;until, with many more, the truth won through.;kirkpatrick
2;26;8422;127;Now since you’re granted generous privilege;kirkpatrick
2;26;8423;128;to pass within those cloistered corridors,;kirkpatrick
2;26;8424;129;where Christ is abbot of the brotherhood,;kirkpatrick
2;26;8425;130;then say a Paternoster for me there –;kirkpatrick
2;26;8426;131;as much, at least, as we, in this world, need –;kirkpatrick
2;26;8427;132;where no ability to sin is ours.’;kirkpatrick
2;26;8428;133;Maybe to give another, nearby, space,;kirkpatrick
2;26;8429;134;he disappeared at this point through the ﬁre,;kirkpatrick
2;26;8430;135;as ﬁsh do going to the water’s depth.;kirkpatrick
2;26;8431;136;I made towards the soul he’d pointed out,;kirkpatrick
2;26;8432;137;and said that my desires were gratefully;kirkpatrick
2;26;8433;138;disposed to ﬁnd a ﬁt place for his name.;kirkpatrick
2;26;8434;139;And, free and open, he began to speak:;kirkpatrick
2;26;8435;140;‘Tan m’abellis vostre cortes deman ,;kirkpatrick
2;26;8436;141;qu’ieu no me puesc ni voill a vos cobrire ,;kirkpatrick
2;26;8437;142;"Ieu sui Arnaut, que plor e vau cantan;";kirkpatrick
2;26;8438;143;consiros vei la passada folor ,;kirkpatrick
2;26;8439;144;e vei jausen lo joi qu’esper denan.;kirkpatrick
2;26;8440;145;Ara vos prec, per aquella valor;kirkpatrick
2;26;8441;146;que vos guida al som de l’escalina ,;kirkpatrick
2;26;8442;147;sovenha vos a temps de ma dolor.’;kirkpatrick
2;26;8443;148;He hid then in the ﬁre that sharpens them.;kirkpatrick
2;27;8444;1;As when it strikes its ﬁrst vibrating rays;kirkpatrick
2;27;8445;2;where once its own Creator shed His blood;kirkpatrick
2;27;8446;3;(the river Ebro falling under Libra’s height,;kirkpatrick
2;27;8447;4;while Ganges’ waves are scorched by noon-time heat);kirkpatrick
2;27;8448;5;at that degree the sun now stood. So day;kirkpatrick
2;27;8449;6;was leaving when, in joy, God’s angel showed.;kirkpatrick
2;27;8450;7;Beyond the ﬂame, he stood there on the bank,;kirkpatrick
2;27;8451;8;and sang the words ‘Beati mundo corde!’ ,;kirkpatrick
2;27;8452;9;his voice far more alive than ours can be.;kirkpatrick
2;27;8453;10;And then: ‘None can, you holy souls, proceed;kirkpatrick
2;27;8454;11;until the ﬁre has bitten them. Go in.;kirkpatrick
2;27;8455;12;And do not turn deaf ears to what is sung!’;kirkpatrick
2;27;8456;13;he said to us, as we came near to him.;kirkpatrick
2;27;8457;14;And I became, on seeing what he meant,;kirkpatrick
2;27;8458;15;as though, still living, placed within a tomb.;kirkpatrick
2;27;8459;16;Over my suppliant hands entwined, I leaned;kirkpatrick
2;27;8460;17;just staring at the ﬁre, imagining;kirkpatrick
2;27;8461;18;bodies of human beings I’d seen burn.;kirkpatrick
2;27;8462;19;And both my trusted guides now turned to me.;kirkpatrick
2;27;8463;20;And Virgil spoke, to say: ‘My dearest son,;kirkpatrick
2;27;8464;21;here may be agony but never death.;kirkpatrick
2;27;8465;22;Remember this! Remember! And if I;kirkpatrick
2;27;8466;23;led you to safety on Geryon’s back,;kirkpatrick
2;27;8467;24;what will I do when now so close to God?;kirkpatrick
2;27;8468;25;Believe this. And be sure. Were you to stay;kirkpatrick
2;27;8469;26;a thousand years or more wombed in this ﬁre,;kirkpatrick
2;27;8470;27;you’d not be made the balder by one hair.;kirkpatrick
2;27;8471;28;And if, perhaps, you think I’m tricking you,;kirkpatrick
2;27;8472;29;approach the ﬁre and reassure yourself,;kirkpatrick
2;27;8473;30;trying with your own hands your garment’s hem.;kirkpatrick
2;27;8474;31;Have done, I say, have done with fearfulness.;kirkpatrick
2;27;8475;32;Turn this way. Come and enter safely in!’;kirkpatrick
2;27;8476;33;But I, against all conscience, stood stock still.;kirkpatrick
2;27;8477;34;And when he saw me stiﬀ and obstinate,;kirkpatrick
2;27;8478;35;he said, a little troubled: ‘Look, my son,;kirkpatrick
2;27;8479;36;between Beatrice and you there’s just this wall.’;kirkpatrick
2;27;8480;37;As Pyramus, on hearing Thisbe’s name,;kirkpatrick
2;27;8481;38;opened his eyelids at the point of death,;kirkpatrick
2;27;8482;39;and (mulberries turning crimson) gazed at her,;kirkpatrick
2;27;8483;40;so, too – my obstinacy softening now –;kirkpatrick
2;27;8484;41;I turned to hear her name, which, growing still,;kirkpatrick
2;27;8485;42;thrives in my thinking to my guide, so wise.;kirkpatrick
2;27;8486;43;Saying ‘What’s this?’ he shook his head. ‘Would you;kirkpatrick
2;27;8487;44;prefer we stayed on this side?’ Then he smiled;kirkpatrick
2;27;8488;45;as though to see a child won round by apples.;kirkpatrick
2;27;8489;46;Ahead of me, he went to meet the ﬁre,;kirkpatrick
2;27;8490;47;and begged that Statius, who had walked the road;kirkpatrick
2;27;8491;48;so long between us, now take up the rear.;kirkpatrick
2;27;8492;49;And, once within, I could have ﬂung myself –;kirkpatrick
2;27;8493;50;the heat that ﬁre produced was measureless –;kirkpatrick
2;27;8494;51;for coolness, in a vat of boiling glass.;kirkpatrick
2;27;8495;52;To strengthen me, my sweetest father spoke,;kirkpatrick
2;27;8496;53;as on he went, of Beatrice always,;kirkpatrick
2;27;8497;54;saying, ‘It seems I see her eyes already.’;kirkpatrick
2;27;8498;55;And, guiding us, a voice sang from beyond.;kirkpatrick
2;27;8499;56;So we, attending only to that voice,;kirkpatrick
2;27;8500;57;came out and saw where now we could ascend.;kirkpatrick
2;27;8501;58;‘Venite, benedicti Patris mei!’;kirkpatrick
2;27;8502;59;sounded within what little light there was.;kirkpatrick
2;27;8503;60;This overcame me and I could not look.;kirkpatrick
2;27;8504;61;‘The sun departs,’ he added. ‘Evening comes.;kirkpatrick
2;27;8505;62;Don’t stop. Think hard about your speed. Keep up,;kirkpatrick
2;27;8506;63;as long as western skies have not turned dark.’;kirkpatrick
2;27;8507;64;The pathway through the rock rose sheer and straight;kirkpatrick
2;27;8508;65;and angled so I cut, ahead of me,;kirkpatrick
2;27;8509;66;the rays of sunlight, which had now sunk low.;kirkpatrick
2;27;8510;67;The steps the sages and myself assayed;kirkpatrick
2;27;8511;68;were few until – my shadow petering out –;kirkpatrick
2;27;8512;69;we sensed the sun behind us laid to rest.;kirkpatrick
2;27;8513;70;Before the sky’s horizon had assumed;kirkpatrick
2;27;8514;71;one look in all its vast unmeasured parts;kirkpatrick
2;27;8515;72;(night gathering all within its lawful bounds);kirkpatrick
2;27;8516;73;on separate stairs we each had made our beds.;kirkpatrick
2;27;8517;74;The mountain by its natural law had wrecked;kirkpatrick
2;27;8518;75;our power to climb and all delight in that.;kirkpatrick
2;27;8519;76;Compare: goats, ruminating, mildly stand;kirkpatrick
2;27;8520;77;where ﬁrst, before they’d fed, they raced above;kirkpatrick
2;27;8521;78;the summits of the hills, eager, untamed,;kirkpatrick
2;27;8522;79;now, while the sun seethes, muted in the shade –;kirkpatrick
2;27;8523;80;their herdsman watching over them, leaning;kirkpatrick
2;27;8524;81;against his stick, so they can safely rest.;kirkpatrick
2;27;8525;82;And shepherds, too, will lodge outdoors beside;kirkpatrick
2;27;8526;83;their ﬂocks, and calmly spend the night on guard,;kirkpatrick
2;27;8527;84;so predators can’t come to scatter them.;kirkpatrick
2;27;8528;85;That is what, now, all three of us were like –;kirkpatrick
2;27;8529;86;they as my shepherds and the she-goat, me –;kirkpatrick
2;27;8530;87;tucked up on either side by towering rock.;kirkpatrick
2;27;8531;88;Little was visible of things beyond.;kirkpatrick
2;27;8532;89;Yet, by that ‘little’ I could see the stars;kirkpatrick
2;27;8533;90;brighter than usual, and of greater size.;kirkpatrick
2;27;8534;91;So, ruminating, wondering so at these,;kirkpatrick
2;27;8535;92;sleep grasped me now – that sleep which often will, before;kirkpatrick
2;27;8536;93;the fact appears, tell all that’s new.;kirkpatrick
2;27;8537;94;At that hour, so I think, when, from the east,;kirkpatrick
2;27;8538;95;Cytherea casts her ﬁrst rays on the hill;kirkpatrick
2;27;8539;96;(seeming to blaze, as always, in love’s ﬁre),;kirkpatrick
2;27;8540;97;lovely and young, a donna in a dream;kirkpatrick
2;27;8541;98;appeared to me and walked along the lea,;kirkpatrick
2;27;8542;99;plucking its ﬂowers and singing as she said:;kirkpatrick
2;27;8543;100;‘Let anyone who asks me for my name;kirkpatrick
2;27;8544;101;know I am Leah, and my lovely hands;kirkpatrick
2;27;8545;102;fashion my garland as I move them round.;kirkpatrick
2;27;8546;103;I dress here so my mirror gives me joy.;kirkpatrick
2;27;8547;104;My sister Rachel, though, entranced, won’t cease;kirkpatrick
2;27;8548;105;to sit all day in wonder at her glass.;kirkpatrick
2;27;8549;106;She yearns to see her own delightful eyes,;kirkpatrick
2;27;8550;107;as I desire to dress by my own hands.;kirkpatrick
2;27;8551;108;Seeing, for her, is all – as doing is for me.;kirkpatrick
2;27;8552;109;Driven before bright antelucan rays;kirkpatrick
2;27;8553;110;(which pilgrims, in returning, welcome more;kirkpatrick
2;27;8554;111;since now they’ve lodged one night less far from home),;kirkpatrick
2;27;8555;112;shadowy dark now ﬂed on every side;kirkpatrick
2;27;8556;113;and, with these shades, my sleep. At which I rose,;kirkpatrick
2;27;8557;114;and saw my masters were already up.;kirkpatrick
2;27;8558;115;‘The sweetest apple that the mortal heart;kirkpatrick
2;27;8559;116;seeks in the branches with such urgency;kirkpatrick
2;27;8560;117;today will oﬀer all your cravings peace.’;kirkpatrick
2;27;8561;118;These words were those that Virgil used on me.;kirkpatrick
2;27;8562;119;And never had such tokens of good luck;kirkpatrick
2;27;8563;120;been equal in the pleasure that they gave.;kirkpatrick
2;27;8564;121;Desire beyond desire came over me;kirkpatrick
2;27;8565;122;to be up there. And so, at every pace,;kirkpatrick
2;27;8566;123;my plumage grew, I felt, more quick to ﬂy.;kirkpatrick
2;27;8567;124;Below us now, the stair had run its course,;kirkpatrick
2;27;8568;125;and we were on the highest of the steps.;kirkpatrick
2;27;8569;126;Then, ﬁrmly, Virgil ﬁxed his eyes on me,;kirkpatrick
2;27;8570;127;saying: ‘The temporal and eternal ﬁres;kirkpatrick
2;27;8571;128;you’ve seen, my son, and now you’re in a place;kirkpatrick
2;27;8572;129;where I, through my own powers, can tell no more.;kirkpatrick
2;27;8573;130;I’ve drawn you here by skill and searching mind.;kirkpatrick
2;27;8574;131;Now take what pleases you to be your guide.;kirkpatrick
2;27;8575;132;You’re now beyond the steeps, beyond all straits.;kirkpatrick
2;27;8576;133;The sun, you see, is shining on your brow.;kirkpatrick
2;27;8577;134;You see the bushes, fresh, young grass, and ﬂowers.;kirkpatrick
2;27;8578;135;The earth by its own powers brings this to be.;kirkpatrick
2;27;8579;136;Until, in joy, those lovely eyes appear;kirkpatrick
2;27;8580;137;that, weeping, made me come to be your guide,;kirkpatrick
2;27;8581;138;through these you may go walking, or may sit.;kirkpatrick
2;27;8582;139;No longer look to me for signs or word.;kirkpatrick
2;27;8583;140;Your will is healthy, upright, free and whole.;kirkpatrick
2;27;8584;141;And not to heed that sense would be a fault.;kirkpatrick
2;28;8585;1;Aching to search, now, in and all around;kirkpatrick
2;28;8586;2;that holy forest, dense, alive and bright,;kirkpatrick
2;28;8587;3;which tempered to my eyes the newborn day,;kirkpatrick
2;28;8588;4;not pausing anymore, I left the verge,;kirkpatrick
2;28;8589;5;treading in slow, slow steps across the ﬁeld.;kirkpatrick
2;28;8590;6;The earth below breathed scent on every side.;kirkpatrick
2;28;8591;7;A gentle breeze, unchanging in itself,;kirkpatrick
2;28;8592;8;struck on my forehead, yet with no more force;kirkpatrick
2;28;8593;9;than would the smoothest of our changing winds.;kirkpatrick
2;28;8594;10;To this the branches, trembling in response,;kirkpatrick
2;28;8595;11;yielded, all bending to the place at which;kirkpatrick
2;28;8596;12;the sacred mountain casts its earliest shade,;kirkpatrick
2;28;8597;13;and yet not leaning so far out of true;kirkpatrick
2;28;8598;14;that ﬂedglings perched among the topmost boughs;kirkpatrick
2;28;8599;15;were forced to leave the practice of their trade.;kirkpatrick
2;28;8600;16;But, full of happiness, they greet the dawn,;kirkpatrick
2;28;8601;17;singing among the foliage which holds;kirkpatrick
2;28;8602;18;a steady undertone to all their tunes –;kirkpatrick
2;28;8603;19;as in those notes that gather, branch by branch,;kirkpatrick
2;28;8604;20;through all the pines along Ravenna’s shore;kirkpatrick
2;28;8605;21;when, from the south, sciroccos start to blow.;kirkpatrick
2;28;8606;22;My steady steps by now had carried me;kirkpatrick
2;28;8607;23;so deep within the ancient wood that I;kirkpatrick
2;28;8608;24;could not see back to where I’d entered ﬁrst.;kirkpatrick
2;28;8609;25;Look there! A brook held back my onward pace.;kirkpatrick
2;28;8610;26;Its course was leftward, and its little waves;kirkpatrick
2;28;8611;27;swayed all the grass that rose along its banks.;kirkpatrick
2;28;8612;28;The purest waters that down here may ﬂow;kirkpatrick
2;28;8613;29;would seem to have admixtures in their depths;kirkpatrick
2;28;8614;30;compared with those, which don’t hide anything.;kirkpatrick
2;28;8615;31;And yet these waters move dark, dark beneath;kirkpatrick
2;28;8616;32;a shadow that’s perpetual and allows;kirkpatrick
2;28;8617;33;no ray of sun or moonlight ever through.;kirkpatrick
2;28;8618;34;My pace here checked, I passed in sight alone;kirkpatrick
2;28;8619;35;beyond that stream, to see and wonder at;kirkpatrick
2;28;8620;36;these May-things in abundance varying.;kirkpatrick
2;28;8621;37;And then appeared to me – as things appear;kirkpatrick
2;28;8622;38;that suddenly in wonder will deﬂect;kirkpatrick
2;28;8623;39;the claims of every other thought we have –;kirkpatrick
2;28;8624;40;a donna all alone who walked along,;kirkpatrick
2;28;8625;41;singing and choosing ﬂowers to pluck from ﬂowers;kirkpatrick
2;28;8626;42;that painted all the way she went upon.;kirkpatrick
2;28;8627;43;‘Lady, you warm yourself in rays of love,;kirkpatrick
2;28;8628;44;or so I think, to see your lovely looks –;kirkpatrick
2;28;8629;45;these usually bear witness to the heart.;kirkpatrick
2;28;8630;46;May you incline, in will, to move more close,’;kirkpatrick
2;28;8631;47;sighing I said, ‘towards this ﬂowing stream,;kirkpatrick
2;28;8632;48;so I may understand the song you sing.;kirkpatrick
2;28;8633;49;You make me call to mind Proserpina,;kirkpatrick
2;28;8634;50;both where and what she was – when she lost Spring;kirkpatrick
2;28;8635;51;and her own mother lost all sight of her.’;kirkpatrick
2;28;8636;52;Her feet together, ﬁrmly pressed to ground;kirkpatrick
2;28;8637;53;as when a donna dances, she then turned;kirkpatrick
2;28;8638;54;and, scarcely setting foot in front of foot,;kirkpatrick
2;28;8639;55;she turned above the yellow and the red;kirkpatrick
2;28;8640;56;of tender ﬂowers, as virgin girls will do;kirkpatrick
2;28;8641;57;when they, for decency, dip down their eyes.;kirkpatrick
2;28;8642;58;Then she in full responded to my prayers,;kirkpatrick
2;28;8643;59;bringing herself so near that that sweet sound;kirkpatrick
2;28;8644;60;came to me, with the meanings that it bore.;kirkpatrick
2;28;8645;61;And now, the moment she’d arrived at where;kirkpatrick
2;28;8646;62;the grass was bathed by waves from that ﬁne stream, she;kirkpatrick
2;28;8647;63;made a gift to me: she raised her eyes.;kirkpatrick
2;28;8648;64;I do not think so great a light shone out;kirkpatrick
2;28;8649;65;beneath the brows of Venus when her son;kirkpatrick
2;28;8650;66;pierced her with love beyond his usual stroke.;kirkpatrick
2;28;8651;67;She stood there, laughing, on the other bank;kirkpatrick
2;28;8652;68;arranging many colours in her hands,;kirkpatrick
2;28;8653;69;strewn by the mighty earth without a seed.;kirkpatrick
2;28;8654;70;The river kept us still three steps apart.;kirkpatrick
2;28;8655;71;And yet the Hellespont where Xerxes passed;kirkpatrick
2;28;8656;72;(a bridle still on all our human pride);kirkpatrick
2;28;8657;73;did not so much incur Leander’s hate,;kirkpatrick
2;28;8658;74;when oceans raged from Sest to Abydos,;kirkpatrick
2;28;8659;75;as this did mine because it would not part.;kirkpatrick
2;28;8660;76;‘You are both new,’ she now began to say,;kirkpatrick
2;28;8661;77;‘in this place, chosen for the human race;kirkpatrick
2;28;8662;78;to make its nest. And you stand wondering,;kirkpatrick
2;28;8663;79;perhaps because I smile, caught up in doubt.;kirkpatrick
2;28;8664;80;The psalm, though, “Delectasti” sheds a light;kirkpatrick
2;28;8665;81;that may dispel the clouds around your mind.;kirkpatrick
2;28;8666;82;And you who begged me speak – the one ahead –;kirkpatrick
2;28;8667;83;say if there’s any more you wish to hear.;kirkpatrick
2;28;8668;84;I’ll quickly come to answer you in full.’;kirkpatrick
2;28;8669;85;‘These waters, and the sound the forest makes,;kirkpatrick
2;28;8670;86;battle within me with a newborn faith;kirkpatrick
2;28;8671;87;in something I’ve heard contrary to this.’;kirkpatrick
2;28;8672;88;At which she said: ‘I’ll tell you, then, the cause;kirkpatrick
2;28;8673;89;from which those things you wonder at derive,;kirkpatrick
2;28;8674;90;and thus will purge the fog that strikes at you.;kirkpatrick
2;28;8675;91;The Highest Good – alone its own delight –;kirkpatrick
2;28;8676;92;made human beings good and ﬁt for good,;kirkpatrick
2;28;8677;93;and gave this place as pledge of endless peace.;kirkpatrick
2;28;8678;94;Through his own fault, Man did not dwell here long.;kirkpatrick
2;28;8679;95;Through his own fault, to weeping and to grief;kirkpatrick
2;28;8680;96;he changed his noble laughter and sweet play.;kirkpatrick
2;28;8681;97;Water and earth below breathe vapours out;kirkpatrick
2;28;8682;98;that search, as fully as they can, for heat,;kirkpatrick
2;28;8683;99;and this induces turbulence down there.;kirkpatrick
2;28;8684;100;Yet, so that these should bring no harm to men,;kirkpatrick
2;28;8685;101;this mountain climbs and reaches to the sky,;kirkpatrick
2;28;8686;102;free of these swirls from where the gate is locked.;kirkpatrick
2;28;8687;103;But now, because the circling sphere of air,;kirkpatrick
2;28;8688;104;if that’s not interrupted in some part,;kirkpatrick
2;28;8689;105;turns altogether as the heavens turn,;kirkpatrick
2;28;8690;106;that motion, unconstrained in living air,;kirkpatrick
2;28;8691;107;will strike directly on this utmost peak;kirkpatrick
2;28;8692;108;and make the forest, being dense, sound out.;kirkpatrick
2;28;8693;109;And plants here, when they’re struck, have such great;kirkpatrick
2;28;8694;110;strength;kirkpatrick
2;28;8695;111;that, with its natural power they seed the breeze,;kirkpatrick
2;28;8696;112;which then, in circling round, will scatter this.;kirkpatrick
2;28;8697;113;The other hemisphere – as far as soil;kirkpatrick
2;28;8698;114;is right, and climate suits – conceives and bears;kirkpatrick
2;28;8699;115;plants in variety with various powers.;kirkpatrick
2;28;8700;116;And hearing this, it would not seem, down there,;kirkpatrick
2;28;8701;117;a source of wonder if a plant takes root;kirkpatrick
2;28;8702;118;without there being, visibly, a seed.;kirkpatrick
2;28;8703;119;And you should know that all this holy ﬁeld;kirkpatrick
2;28;8704;120;is ﬁlled where you are now with every seed,;kirkpatrick
2;28;8705;121;and here has fruits which, there, are never plucked.;kirkpatrick
2;28;8706;122;The water that you see is from no well;kirkpatrick
2;28;8707;123;(as rivers are that gain and lose in force);kirkpatrick
2;28;8708;124;that’s freshly ﬁlled when ice condenses mist,;kirkpatrick
2;28;8709;125;but issues, sure and steady, from a spring;kirkpatrick
2;28;8710;126;that gathers all it has from God’s own will,;kirkpatrick
2;28;8711;127;which then it pours out, opening in two parts.;kirkpatrick
2;28;8712;128;It ﬂows, in this part, down with all its power;kirkpatrick
2;28;8713;129;to take the memory of sin away,;kirkpatrick
2;28;8714;130;restoring, on the other, all good done.;kirkpatrick
2;28;8715;131;Its name is Lethe here, Eunoe there.;kirkpatrick
2;28;8716;132;Until a taste is had on either side,;kirkpatrick
2;28;8717;133;the inﬂuence it has won’t take eﬀect.;kirkpatrick
2;28;8718;134;This savour is above all other tastes;kirkpatrick
2;28;8719;135;and – though your thirst would none the less be slaked if I;kirkpatrick
2;28;8720;136;disclosed to you no more than this –  I’ll add one;kirkpatrick
2;28;8721;137;footnote, out of grace and thanks.;kirkpatrick
2;28;8722;138;(I cannot think you’ll hold my words less dear;kirkpatrick
2;28;8723;139;if these soar out beyond my promised theme.);kirkpatrick
2;28;8724;140;Those who, in times long gone, composed those;kirkpatrick
2;28;8725;141;poems;kirkpatrick
2;28;8726;142;that sang the Age of Gold and all its joys;kirkpatrick
2;28;8727;143;thought, maybe here’s Parnassus when they dreamed.;kirkpatrick
2;28;8728;144;Here, once, the root of man was innocent.;kirkpatrick
2;28;8729;145;Here, there is always spring and every fruit.;kirkpatrick
2;28;8730;146;And that’s the nectar they all speak about.’;kirkpatrick
2;28;8731;147;I swung around to face my poets there,;kirkpatrick
2;28;8732;148;and both (as I could tell) had smiled to hear;kirkpatrick
2;28;8733;149;the meaning of the words that she’d spelled out.;kirkpatrick
2;28;8734;150;I then turned back to see that lovely girl.;kirkpatrick
2;29;8735;1;Singing as might some donna deep in love,;kirkpatrick
2;29;8736;2;she then went on and brought an end to words:;kirkpatrick
2;29;8737;3;‘Beati quorum tecta sunt peccata.’;kirkpatrick
2;29;8738;4;And then, as nymphs who, once, would go alone;kirkpatrick
2;29;8739;5;through woodland shadows longing, some of them,;kirkpatrick
2;29;8740;6;to see the sun while others ﬂed its rays,;kirkpatrick
2;29;8741;7;she moved, against the course that clear stream ran,;kirkpatrick
2;29;8742;8;walking along her bank while I kept up,;kirkpatrick
2;29;8743;9;with small steps too, pursuing her small pace.;kirkpatrick
2;29;8744;10;Before a hundred steps had gone (to count;kirkpatrick
2;29;8745;11;both hers and mine) the banks on either side;kirkpatrick
2;29;8746;12;curved equally, so I was facing east.;kirkpatrick
2;29;8747;13;Nor did our path continue so for long,;kirkpatrick
2;29;8748;14;until the lady turned direct to me,;kirkpatrick
2;29;8749;15;saying: ‘Dear brother, watch now and listen.’;kirkpatrick
2;29;8750;16;And look! A sudden radiance, darting all;kirkpatrick
2;29;8751;17;around, pierced that great forest through and through, at;kirkpatrick
2;29;8752;18;which I thought that lightning may have struck.;kirkpatrick
2;29;8753;19;But lightning, when it comes, is quenched at once,;kirkpatrick
2;29;8754;20;where this, enduring, shone out more and more.;kirkpatrick
2;29;8755;21;So I was left, thought muttering: ‘What is this?’;kirkpatrick
2;29;8756;22;And then, through all that luminous air, there ran;kirkpatrick
2;29;8757;23;a melody so ﬁne that purest zeal;kirkpatrick
2;29;8758;24;made me reprove the recklessness of Eve.;kirkpatrick
2;29;8759;25;Where earth and Heaven displayed obedience,;kirkpatrick
2;29;8760;26;a woman, one alone, formed only now,;kirkpatrick
2;29;8761;27;was not content to stay beneath the veil.;kirkpatrick
2;29;8762;28;Had she in true devotion stayed beneath,;kirkpatrick
2;29;8763;29;I should have known these pleasures, past all speech, far;kirkpatrick
2;29;8764;30;sooner and enjoyed them at more length.;kirkpatrick
2;29;8765;31;While on I went among these primal fruits,;kirkpatrick
2;29;8766;32;the pleasures yielded by eternity,;kirkpatrick
2;29;8767;33;caught up, desiring yet more happiness,;kirkpatrick
2;29;8768;34;ahead of us, beneath the branching green,;kirkpatrick
2;29;8769;35;the air blazed up like newly kindled ﬁre,;kirkpatrick
2;29;8770;36;and that sweet sound was clearly heard as song.;kirkpatrick
2;29;8771;37;You holy virgin Muses, if, for you,;kirkpatrick
2;29;8772;38;I’ve ever suﬀered vigils, fast or cold,;kirkpatrick
2;29;8773;39;there’s now all reason to beseech your aid.;kirkpatrick
2;29;8774;40;Now Helicon must pour in streams for me,;kirkpatrick
2;29;8775;41;Urania with her choirs assist me here,;kirkpatrick
2;29;8776;42;to put in verse things hardly thinkable.;kirkpatrick
2;29;8777;43;Just further on were seven trees of gold –;kirkpatrick
2;29;8778;44;that semblance given them, mistakenly,;kirkpatrick
2;29;8779;45;by distance that, between us, intervened.;kirkpatrick
2;29;8780;46;But when I’d got so near to them that now;kirkpatrick
2;29;8781;47;(far oﬀ, aspectuals can fool our sense);kirkpatrick
2;29;8782;48;these things lost nothing of their proper form,;kirkpatrick
2;29;8783;49;that power that sends (as manna) rational thought,;kirkpatrick
2;29;8784;50;discerned that these were candle-bearing staves,;kirkpatrick
2;29;8785;51;and heard ‘Hosanna’ in that singing voice.;kirkpatrick
2;29;8786;52;These ﬁne devices ﬂamed around their heights;kirkpatrick
2;29;8787;53;far clearer than the moon in tranquil skies,;kirkpatrick
2;29;8788;54;at midnight in the middle of a month.;kirkpatrick
2;29;8789;55;Filled full of radiant wonder, I turned round;kirkpatrick
2;29;8790;56;to honest Virgil, and he answered me;kirkpatrick
2;29;8791;57;with looks no less weighed down by heavy awe.;kirkpatrick
2;29;8792;58;I then restored my gaze to those high things;kirkpatrick
2;29;8793;59;that came towards us now and moved so slow;kirkpatrick
2;29;8794;60;that new-wed brides would quickly have gone past.;kirkpatrick
2;29;8795;61;The lady reprimanded me: ‘Why burn,;kirkpatrick
2;29;8796;62;so moved, to see alone these living lights;kirkpatrick
2;29;8797;63;and fail to look at what comes after them?’;kirkpatrick
2;29;8798;64;I then saw people guided by the ﬂames,;kirkpatrick
2;29;8799;65;now coming near to us. Their robes were white,;kirkpatrick
2;29;8800;66;of brilliant purity not seen down here.;kirkpatrick
2;29;8801;67;The water to my left reﬂected ﬁre,;kirkpatrick
2;29;8802;68;and rendered back to me, if I looked down,;kirkpatrick
2;29;8803;69;as mirrors do, the sight of my left side.;kirkpatrick
2;29;8804;70;When, on my own bank, I had reached a place;kirkpatrick
2;29;8805;71;where I was distanced only by the stream,;kirkpatrick
2;29;8806;72;I brought my steps to rest, to see them well.;kirkpatrick
2;29;8807;73;I saw those ﬂames, diminishing, move on,;kirkpatrick
2;29;8808;74;leaving behind a paint stroke in the air,;kirkpatrick
2;29;8809;75;as though they all drew pennants after them,;kirkpatrick
2;29;8810;76;so that, above them, there were seven streams,;kirkpatrick
2;29;8811;77;their colours those the sun makes with its bow;kirkpatrick
2;29;8812;78;or else the girdle of the Delian moon.;kirkpatrick
2;29;8813;79;These pennants stretched far back beyond my sight.;kirkpatrick
2;29;8814;80;The outer two, as far as I could tell,;kirkpatrick
2;29;8815;81;were drawn on through the air ten steps apart.;kirkpatrick
2;29;8816;82;And under this ﬁne sky, as here described,;kirkpatrick
2;29;8817;83;were elders – twenty-four – who walked in pairs,;kirkpatrick
2;29;8818;84;and each of them was crowned with ﬂeurs-de-lys.;kirkpatrick
2;29;8819;85;And all of these were singing: ‘You among;kirkpatrick
2;29;8820;86;the daughters born to Adam are benedicta ,;kirkpatrick
2;29;8821;87;your beauty blessed to all eternity.’;kirkpatrick
2;29;8822;88;And when, across from me, the other bank –;kirkpatrick
2;29;8823;89;with all its ﬂowers and other fresh young growth – was;kirkpatrick
2;29;8824;90;free of these, who were the chosen ones,;kirkpatrick
2;29;8825;91;as light lights up in sequence through the sky,;kirkpatrick
2;29;8826;92;there came behind them now four animals,;kirkpatrick
2;29;8827;93;and each of these was crowned with boughs of green.;kirkpatrick
2;29;8828;94;And each was ﬂedged and feathered with six wings.;kirkpatrick
2;29;8829;95;These feathers all were peacock-eyed. The eyes;kirkpatrick
2;29;8830;96;of Argus would, if they still lived, be like this.;kirkpatrick
2;29;8831;97;I’ll scatter, reader, no more rhymes to trace;kirkpatrick
2;29;8832;98;what these forms were. Other expenditure;kirkpatrick
2;29;8833;99;"constrains me; I cannot be generous.";kirkpatrick
2;29;8834;100;But read Ezekiel, who paints them all;kirkpatrick
2;29;8835;101;as once he saw them, coming from cold climes;kirkpatrick
2;29;8836;102;in whirlwinds, towering clouds and folds of ﬁre.;kirkpatrick
2;29;8837;103;And as you’ll ﬁnd them written on his page,;kirkpatrick
2;29;8838;104;so were they there, except that, as to wings,;kirkpatrick
2;29;8839;105;Saint John is with me, and departs from him.;kirkpatrick
2;29;8840;106;The space that lay between these four contained;kirkpatrick
2;29;8841;107;a two-wheeled chariot in triumphal state.;kirkpatrick
2;29;8842;108;A gryphon drew it, harnessed at the neck.;kirkpatrick
2;29;8843;109;This gryphon held his two wings stretched on high;kirkpatrick
2;29;8844;110;between the middle band and three and three,;kirkpatrick
2;29;8845;111;so that, in cleaving air, he did no harm.;kirkpatrick
2;29;8846;112;These wings rose higher than the eye could see.;kirkpatrick
2;29;8847;113;The bird-limbs of that form were all of gold,;kirkpatrick
2;29;8848;114;the others white, commingling with bright red.;kirkpatrick
2;29;8849;115;Not only did not Rome cheer Scipio;kirkpatrick
2;29;8850;116;with such ﬁne chariots (or Caesar, even!);kirkpatrick
2;29;8851;117;the sun itself beside that would look poor –;kirkpatrick
2;29;8852;118;the sun that burned to nothing when it strayed;kirkpatrick
2;29;8853;119;(here Jove for his dark reasons once proved just);kirkpatrick
2;29;8854;120;in answer to the prayers of pious earth.;kirkpatrick
2;29;8855;121;Beside the right-hand wheel, three ladies came,;kirkpatrick
2;29;8856;122;all dancing in a ring, the ﬁrst so red;kirkpatrick
2;29;8857;123;that she, in ﬁre, would hardly have been seen,;kirkpatrick
2;29;8858;124;the next as if her very bones and ﬂesh;kirkpatrick
2;29;8859;125;were fashioned from the freshest emerald,;kirkpatrick
2;29;8860;126;the third like snow just fallen from the sky.;kirkpatrick
2;29;8861;127;Their steps were drawn, it seems, by, ﬁrst, the white,;kirkpatrick
2;29;8862;128;then red, and from the song that this one sang;kirkpatrick
2;29;8863;129;the others took their tempo, fast or slow.;kirkpatrick
2;29;8864;130;Four ladies to the left, all purple-clothed,;kirkpatrick
2;29;8865;131;rejoiced in following the melody;kirkpatrick
2;29;8866;132;of one of them, whose brow displayed three eyes.;kirkpatrick
2;29;8867;133;Then, close within the track of this tight knot,;kirkpatrick
2;29;8868;134;I saw two elders, diﬀering in their garb,;kirkpatrick
2;29;8869;135;but equal in demeanour, grave and ﬁrm;kirkpatrick
2;29;8870;136;One showed himself a close familiar;kirkpatrick
2;29;8871;137;of great Hippocrates, whom Nature formed;kirkpatrick
2;29;8872;138;to serve the creatures that she loved the best.;kirkpatrick
2;29;8873;139;The other showed the opposite concern,;kirkpatrick
2;29;8874;140;a well-honed sword in hand – so bright and keen;kirkpatrick
2;29;8875;141;it brought me terror from beyond the stream.;kirkpatrick
2;29;8876;142;I then saw four, each one with humble looks,;kirkpatrick
2;29;8877;143;and after these, an old man all alone,;kirkpatrick
2;29;8878;144;who came as though still sleeping, face alert.;kirkpatrick
2;29;8879;145;These seven were clothed as was the ﬁrst brigade;kirkpatrick
2;29;8880;146;except that, as they came, around their heads,;kirkpatrick
2;29;8881;147;they wore no garland formed of lilia,;kirkpatrick
2;29;8882;148;but roses, rather, and vermilion ﬂowers.;kirkpatrick
2;29;8883;149;And, standing just a short way oﬀ, you’d swear;kirkpatrick
2;29;8884;150;that all, above their brows, bore searing ﬁre.;kirkpatrick
2;29;8885;151;When, now, that chariot stood facing me,;kirkpatrick
2;29;8886;152;thunder was heard. These people of great worth;kirkpatrick
2;29;8887;153;were banned, it seemed, from going further on.;kirkpatrick
2;29;8888;154;With standards to the fore, they halted there.;kirkpatrick
2;30;8889;1;Those Seven Polar Stars that constellate;kirkpatrick
2;30;8890;2;the highest sphere, and never knowing nadir;kirkpatrick
2;30;8891;3;or zenith, veiled by the murk of sin alone,;kirkpatrick
2;30;8892;4;those stars that make the souls, in Heaven, aware;kirkpatrick
2;30;8893;5;of what is right (as, by our Wain, down here,;kirkpatrick
2;30;8894;6;a helmsman turns his wheel to steer for port);kirkpatrick
2;30;8895;7;stopped and stood ﬁrm. The people of the truth –;kirkpatrick
2;30;8896;8;who marched between the Gryphon and these stars –;kirkpatrick
2;30;8897;9;turned, as though each found peace, towards the chariot.;kirkpatrick
2;30;8898;10;And one of them, as sent from Heaven, cried out:;kirkpatrick
2;30;8899;11;‘Veni, sponsa, de Libano!’ singing;kirkpatrick
2;30;8900;12;(the others followed on) this verse three times.;kirkpatrick
2;30;8901;13;As when the Last New Day is heralded,;kirkpatrick
2;30;8902;14;and happy souls will rise keen from their caves,;kirkpatrick
2;30;8903;15;dressed in new voice, to echo ‘Alleluia’;kirkpatrick
2;30;8904;16;so now, ad vocem tanti senis , there arose;kirkpatrick
2;30;8905;17;above the hallowed chariot a hundred;kirkpatrick
2;30;8906;18;angels, all bearing news of eternal life.;kirkpatrick
2;30;8907;19;They spoke thus: ‘Benedictus qui venis!’;kirkpatrick
2;30;8908;20;and, strewing petals upward and around:;kirkpatrick
2;30;8909;21;‘Manibus , oh, date lilia plenis!’;kirkpatrick
2;30;8910;22;I saw, once, at the opening of the day,;kirkpatrick
2;30;8911;23;the orient sky in colour all clear rose,;kirkpatrick
2;30;8912;24;the western height still robed in tranquil blue,;kirkpatrick
2;30;8913;25;and then the sun newborn, with shadowed face,;kirkpatrick
2;30;8914;26;hazy, in vapours that so tempered it;kirkpatrick
2;30;8915;27;that eyes could tolerate its light a while.;kirkpatrick
2;30;8916;28;So now, beyond a drifting cloud of ﬂowers;kirkpatrick
2;30;8917;29;(which rose up, arching, from the angels’ hands,;kirkpatrick
2;30;8918;30;then fell within and round the chariot),;kirkpatrick
2;30;8919;31;seen through a veil, pure white, and olive-crowned,;kirkpatrick
2;30;8920;32;a lady now appeared to me. Her robe was green,;kirkpatrick
2;30;8921;33;her dress the colour of a living ﬂame.;kirkpatrick
2;30;8922;34;And I, in spirit, who so long had not;kirkpatrick
2;30;8923;35;been, trembling in her presence, wracked by awe,;kirkpatrick
2;30;8924;36;began again to tremble at her glance;kirkpatrick
2;30;8925;37;(without more evidence that eyes could bring,;kirkpatrick
2;30;8926;38;but darkly, through the good that ﬂowed from her),;kirkpatrick
2;30;8927;39;sensing the ancient power of what love was.;kirkpatrick
2;30;8928;40;But on the instant that it struck my sight –;kirkpatrick
2;30;8929;41;this power, this virtue, that had pierced me through;kirkpatrick
2;30;8930;42;before I’d even left my boyhood state –;kirkpatrick
2;30;8931;43;I turned aside (and leftwards) meaning now,;kirkpatrick
2;30;8932;44;with all the hope and deference of some child;kirkpatrick
2;30;8933;45;that runs when hurt or frightened to its mum,;kirkpatrick
2;30;8934;46;to say to Virgil: ‘There is not one gram;kirkpatrick
2;30;8935;47;of blood in me that does not tremble now.;kirkpatrick
2;30;8936;48;I recognize the signs of ancient ﬂame.’;kirkpatrick
2;30;8937;49;But Virgil was not there. Our lack alone;kirkpatrick
2;30;8938;50;was left where once he’d been. Virgil, dear sire,;kirkpatrick
2;30;8939;51;Virgil – to him I’d run to save my soul.;kirkpatrick
2;30;8940;52;Nor could the All our primal mother lost,;kirkpatrick
2;30;8941;53;ensure my cheeks – which he once washed with dew –;kirkpatrick
2;30;8942;54;should not again be sullied with dark tears.;kirkpatrick
2;30;8943;55;‘Dante, that Virgil is no longer here,;kirkpatrick
2;30;8944;56;do not yet weep, do not yet weep for that.;kirkpatrick
2;30;8945;57;A diﬀerent sword cut, ﬁrst, must make you weep.’;kirkpatrick
2;30;8946;58;From stern to prow, some admiral will pace;kirkpatrick
2;30;8947;59;to see how well, in other hulls, his captains fare,;kirkpatrick
2;30;8948;60;and seek to hearten them to do their best.;kirkpatrick
2;30;8949;61;So, almost (left along the chariot),;kirkpatrick
2;30;8950;62;turning around to hear my own name voiced;kirkpatrick
2;30;8951;63;(I here record it of necessity),;kirkpatrick
2;30;8952;64;I saw my donna – who’d at ﬁrst appeared;kirkpatrick
2;30;8953;65;hidden in garlands of angelic joy –;kirkpatrick
2;30;8954;66;ﬁx, from beyond the brook, her eyes on me,;kirkpatrick
2;30;8955;67;though still the veil descending from her brows,;kirkpatrick
2;30;8956;68;encircled with Minerva’s olive fronds,;kirkpatrick
2;30;8957;69;did not allow, distinctly, any sight of her.;kirkpatrick
2;30;8958;70;Her look was stern and proud. With sovereign strength,;kirkpatrick
2;30;8959;71;she then went on, and spoke as though she still;kirkpatrick
2;30;8960;72;held back, until the last, her ﬁeriest words.;kirkpatrick
2;30;8961;73;‘Look. I am, truly, I am Beatrice.;kirkpatrick
2;30;8962;74;What right had you to venture to this mount?;kirkpatrick
2;30;8963;75;Did you not know that all are happy here?’;kirkpatrick
2;30;8964;76;My eyes fell, glancing to the spring-clear brook,;kirkpatrick
2;30;8965;77;but, seeing me in that, shame bent my brow.;kirkpatrick
2;30;8966;78;I dragged my gaze back to the grassy bank.;kirkpatrick
2;30;8967;79;A mother, to her son, looks stern and proud.;kirkpatrick
2;30;8968;80;So she appeared to me. For true concern;kirkpatrick
2;30;8969;81;is bitter to the taste and quick to sting.;kirkpatrick
2;30;8970;82;"She did not speak; but suddenly, as one,";kirkpatrick
2;30;8971;83;the angels sang: ‘In te, Domine, speravi’ ,;kirkpatrick
2;30;8972;84;but did not go beyond the ‘pedes meos’ .;kirkpatrick
2;30;8973;85;Compare: the snow that falls through growing eaves;kirkpatrick
2;30;8974;86;freezes the spine of Italy in drifts;kirkpatrick
2;30;8975;87;blown and compacted by Slavonian winds.;kirkpatrick
2;30;8976;88;But when the southern lands (where shadow fails);kirkpatrick
2;30;8977;89;breathe once again, within itself it thaws,;kirkpatrick
2;30;8978;90;then trickles down, as candles melt in ﬂames.;kirkpatrick
2;30;8979;91;So, too, until those beings sang – their notes;kirkpatrick
2;30;8980;92;are all concordant with the heavenly spheres –;kirkpatrick
2;30;8981;93;I’d been there uttering no sigh or tear.;kirkpatrick
2;30;8982;94;And yet, on hearing, through these harmonies,;kirkpatrick
2;30;8983;95;their pity on me (it seemed they had said:;kirkpatrick
2;30;8984;96;‘Why, donna , cause him discord such as this?’),;kirkpatrick
2;30;8985;97;the ice, so tightly stretched around my core,;kirkpatrick
2;30;8986;98;turned now to breath and water, issuing,;kirkpatrick
2;30;8987;99;at mouth and eye, in spasms from my heart.;kirkpatrick
2;30;8988;100;Then she (still leftwards on the chariot),;kirkpatrick
2;30;8989;101;unmoved and standing ﬁrm, addressed her words;kirkpatrick
2;30;8990;102;to these true beings, so compassionate:;kirkpatrick
2;30;8991;103;‘You wake, in vigil, through eternal day.;kirkpatrick
2;30;8992;104;So neither night nor sleep can steal from you;kirkpatrick
2;30;8993;105;a single step that time takes, travelling by.;kirkpatrick
2;30;8994;106;Thus, answering, my greater care must be;kirkpatrick
2;30;8995;107;that he, in tears there, grasps what I intend,;kirkpatrick
2;30;8996;108;and brings to balance all his grief and guilt.;kirkpatrick
2;30;8997;109;Not only by the work of Heaven’s great wheels;kirkpatrick
2;30;8998;110;that send, with its companion stars, each seed;kirkpatrick
2;30;8999;111;along the road towards its rightful end,;kirkpatrick
2;30;9000;112;but also by those holy generosities;kirkpatrick
2;30;9001;113;that rain in grace from clouded powers so high;kirkpatrick
2;30;9002;114;that human sight can come in no way near,;kirkpatrick
2;30;9003;115;this man through all his new life, fresh and young,;kirkpatrick
2;30;9004;116;in virtual power was one who might have proved,;kirkpatrick
2;30;9005;117;in all of his behaviour, wonderful.;kirkpatrick
2;30;9006;118;Yet there, on earth, the richer soil may be,;kirkpatrick
2;30;9007;119;the more – untilled or sown with evil seed –;kirkpatrick
2;30;9008;120;its vigour turns to wilderness and bane.;kirkpatrick
2;30;9009;121;I, looking on, sustained him for a time.;kirkpatrick
2;30;9010;122;My eyes, when bright with youth, I turned to him,;kirkpatrick
2;30;9011;123;and led him with me on the road to truth.;kirkpatrick
2;30;9012;124;Then, on the threshold of my second age,;kirkpatrick
2;30;9013;125;I changed, took diﬀerent life, and he at once;kirkpatrick
2;30;9014;126;drew back and yielded to another’s glance.;kirkpatrick
2;30;9015;127;Risen from body into spirit-form,;kirkpatrick
2;30;9016;128;my goodness, power and beauty grew more strong.;kirkpatrick
2;30;9017;129;Yet I to him was then less dear, less pleasing.;kirkpatrick
2;30;9018;130;He turned his steps to paths that were not true.;kirkpatrick
2;30;9019;131;He followed images of failing good;kirkpatrick
2;30;9020;132;which cannot meet, in full, their promises.;kirkpatrick
2;30;9021;133;And when I prayed that he might be inspired,;kirkpatrick
2;30;9022;134;seeking to call him back – by dreams and other ways –;kirkpatrick
2;30;9023;135;all that came to nothing. He paid little heed.;kirkpatrick
2;30;9024;136;He fell so far that every other means;kirkpatrick
2;30;9025;137;to save this man, by now, came short, unless;kirkpatrick
2;30;9026;138;he saw, himself, those people who are lost.;kirkpatrick
2;30;9027;139;I went, then, to the doorway of the dead,;kirkpatrick
2;30;9028;140;and, weeping, my entreaties there were borne;kirkpatrick
2;30;9029;141;to one who, since, has brought him to these heights.;kirkpatrick
2;30;9030;142;God’s high decree would shatter, though, if he;kirkpatrick
2;30;9031;143;should pass by the Lethe and go on to taste;kirkpatrick
2;30;9032;144;the food of life, yet leave unpaid the tax;kirkpatrick
2;30;9033;145;of penitence, which pours out ﬂowing tears.’;kirkpatrick
2;31;9034;1;‘You, who are there beyond the sacred stream,’;kirkpatrick
2;31;9035;2;turning the sword point of her words on me;kirkpatrick
2;31;9036;3;(the edge alone had seemed quite keen enough),;kirkpatrick
2;31;9037;4;so, without lapse continuing, she began,;kirkpatrick
2;31;9038;5;‘Say, say, if this is true. To such a charge;kirkpatrick
2;31;9039;6;your own confession needs to be conjoined.’;kirkpatrick
2;31;9040;7;My natural powers by now were so confused;kirkpatrick
2;31;9041;8;that voice began to move, and yet gave out;kirkpatrick
2;31;9042;9;before it cleared the larynx and the throat.;kirkpatrick
2;31;9043;10;She bore this for a while, and then she said:;kirkpatrick
2;31;9044;11;‘Respond to me. Your wretched memories;kirkpatrick
2;31;9045;12;have not been struck through yet by Lethe’s stream.’;kirkpatrick
2;31;9046;13;Fear and confusion, intermixed in me,;kirkpatrick
2;31;9047;14;drove from my lips a ‘yes’ so hard to hear;kirkpatrick
2;31;9048;15;it needed sight to make it understood.;kirkpatrick
2;31;9049;16;A crossbow triggered under too much stress;kirkpatrick
2;31;9050;17;snaps its own string and splinters at the arc.;kirkpatrick
2;31;9051;18;Its shaft thus hits the target with less force.;kirkpatrick
2;31;9052;19;I burst in that same way beneath the load;kirkpatrick
2;31;9053;20;and, shedding streams of sighs and sobs and tears, my;kirkpatrick
2;31;9054;21;voice came slack and slow along its course.;kirkpatrick
2;31;9055;22;And so: ‘In your desire for me,’ she said,;kirkpatrick
2;31;9056;23;‘which then was leading you to love the Good;kirkpatrick
2;31;9057;24;beyond which we cannot aspire to reach,;kirkpatrick
2;31;9058;25;what ditches or what chains across your path;kirkpatrick
2;31;9059;26;did you discover that led you to strip;kirkpatrick
2;31;9060;27;the hopes you had of getting further on?;kirkpatrick
2;31;9061;28;What easements, proﬁts, gain or beneﬁt;kirkpatrick
2;31;9062;29;displayed themselves to you on other brows;kirkpatrick
2;31;9063;30;that you preferred to ﬂounce within their sight?’;kirkpatrick
2;31;9064;31;I drew the bitterest of sighs, but then;kirkpatrick
2;31;9065;32;I hardly had the voice left to respond.;kirkpatrick
2;31;9066;33;My lips were labouring to give to words some form.;kirkpatrick
2;31;9067;34;Weeping, I said: ‘Mere things of here and now;kirkpatrick
2;31;9068;35;and their false pleasures turned my steps away;kirkpatrick
2;31;9069;36;the moment that your face had hid itself.’;kirkpatrick
2;31;9070;37;‘Had you,’ she said, ‘been silent, or denied;kirkpatrick
2;31;9071;38;what you confess, your guilt would equally;kirkpatrick
2;31;9072;39;have been observed. It’s known to such a judge!;kirkpatrick
2;31;9073;40;But when the plea of guilty, in this court,;kirkpatrick
2;31;9074;41;bursts, freely uttered, from the sinner’s cheek,;kirkpatrick
2;31;9075;42;the grindstone here will turn against the blade.;kirkpatrick
2;31;9076;43;And yet – so you may bear the proper shame;kirkpatrick
2;31;9077;44;your error brings and, hearing, once again,;kirkpatrick
2;31;9078;45;the siren call you may show greater strength –;kirkpatrick
2;31;9079;46;put to one side the seed that nurtures tears.;kirkpatrick
2;31;9080;47;Listen and hear how down a diﬀerent path;kirkpatrick
2;31;9081;48;my ﬂesh, when buried, should have made you move.;kirkpatrick
2;31;9082;49;Never had art or nature shown to you;kirkpatrick
2;31;9083;50;such beauty and delight as did those limbs;kirkpatrick
2;31;9084;51;in which I was enclosed, now strewn in earth.;kirkpatrick
2;31;9085;52;And if that great delight, because I died,;kirkpatrick
2;31;9086;53;did fail for you, what other dying thing;kirkpatrick
2;31;9087;54;should then have drawn you to desire of it?;kirkpatrick
2;31;9088;55;Pierced by the arrows of fallacious things,;kirkpatrick
2;31;9089;56;you should at once have raised yourself on high,;kirkpatrick
2;31;9090;57;to follow me, I being none such now.;kirkpatrick
2;31;9091;58;You ought not to have weighed your feathers down;kirkpatrick
2;31;9092;59;just waiting to be stricken by some girl,;kirkpatrick
2;31;9093;60;or other novelty of short-lived use.;kirkpatrick
2;31;9094;61;A newborn chick will take a blow or two.;kirkpatrick
2;31;9095;62;But arrows ﬂy, and nets are spread in vain,;kirkpatrick
2;31;9096;63;before the eyes of any fully ﬂedged.’;kirkpatrick
2;31;9097;64;As little boys who stand there dumb with shame,;kirkpatrick
2;31;9098;65;eyes on the ground and listening to what’s said,;kirkpatrick
2;31;9099;66;aware – very sorry – of what they are,;kirkpatrick
2;31;9100;67;so I, too, simply stood. And she said: ‘Since;kirkpatrick
2;31;9101;68;you grieve at what you’re hearing, raise your beard and,;kirkpatrick
2;31;9102;69;looking up, you’ll feel still greater pain.’;kirkpatrick
2;31;9103;70;With less resistance some well-sinewed oak;kirkpatrick
2;31;9104;71;is rooted out by northern winds of ours,;kirkpatrick
2;31;9105;72;or blasts from savage Iarbas’ Libyan realm,;kirkpatrick
2;31;9106;73;than I at her command raised up my chin.;kirkpatrick
2;31;9107;74;And when she spoke of ‘beard’ (to name my face),;kirkpatrick
2;31;9108;75;I knew the venom that her meaning bore.;kirkpatrick
2;31;9109;76;But as I stretched to show my face to her,;kirkpatrick
2;31;9110;77;those primal creatures, as my eyes observed,;kirkpatrick
2;31;9111;78;had ceased in scattering their arc of ﬂowers.;kirkpatrick
2;31;9112;79;Those lights of mine, still very far from sure,;kirkpatrick
2;31;9113;80;saw Beatrice turn towards the beast,;kirkpatrick
2;31;9114;81;being two natures and, in person, one.;kirkpatrick
2;31;9115;82;Beneath her veil, beyond the ﬂowing stream,;kirkpatrick
2;31;9116;83;she overcame, it seemed, what once she’d been,;kirkpatrick
2;31;9117;84;when once, as here, she overcame all women.;kirkpatrick
2;31;9118;85;The nettle of remorse now stung so sharp,;kirkpatrick
2;31;9119;86;whatever else had drawn me most to love;kirkpatrick
2;31;9120;87;became for me my utmost enemy.;kirkpatrick
2;31;9121;88;It gnawed my heart – the consciousness of this –;kirkpatrick
2;31;9122;89;that, overwhelmed, I fell. What I became,;kirkpatrick
2;31;9123;90;she knows who is the cause of why I did.;kirkpatrick
2;31;9124;91;Then when my heart gave back my outward powers,;kirkpatrick
2;31;9125;92;the donna whom I’d found there all alone,;kirkpatrick
2;31;9126;93;I saw above me, saying: ‘Grip me! Grip!’;kirkpatrick
2;31;9127;94;She’d drawn me up to throat height in the stream,;kirkpatrick
2;31;9128;95;and, pulling me behind her, went her way;kirkpatrick
2;31;9129;96;across the wave as light as any skiﬀ.;kirkpatrick
2;31;9130;97;And then, when I approached the blessed shore,;kirkpatrick
2;31;9131;98;‘Asperges me’ was heard, so sweetly sung;kirkpatrick
2;31;9132;99;I can’t remember it, still less can write.;kirkpatrick
2;31;9133;100;That lovely lady, opening wide her arms,;kirkpatrick
2;31;9134;101;circled my head, submerging me so far;kirkpatrick
2;31;9135;102;I could not help but swallow from the stream.;kirkpatrick
2;31;9136;103;From there she took and led me, bathed, still wet,;kirkpatrick
2;31;9137;104;to join the dance of those four lovely ones.;kirkpatrick
2;31;9138;105;And each one raised an arm to cover me.;kirkpatrick
2;31;9139;106;‘We, here, are nymphs and, in the heavens, stars,;kirkpatrick
2;31;9140;107;given to Beatrice as her maids,;kirkpatrick
2;31;9141;108;before she ﬁrst descended to the world.;kirkpatrick
2;31;9142;109;We’ll lead you to her eyes. Yet to that light,;kirkpatrick
2;31;9143;110;so jubilant, within, those three beyond –;kirkpatrick
2;31;9144;111;their gaze still deeper – will make yours more keen.’;kirkpatrick
2;31;9145;112;So, singing, they began and, moving on,;kirkpatrick
2;31;9146;113;they brought me with them to the Gryphon’s breast,;kirkpatrick
2;31;9147;114;where, turned towards us, Beatrice stood.;kirkpatrick
2;31;9148;115;‘Make sure,’ they said, ‘you do not spare your eyes.;kirkpatrick
2;31;9149;116;We’ve placed you here before these emeralds,;kirkpatrick
2;31;9150;117;from which Love aimed his arrows at you once.’;kirkpatrick
2;31;9151;118;A thousand longings, ﬁercer far than ﬂame,;kirkpatrick
2;31;9152;119;wrestled my eyes to her eyes, shining back,;kirkpatrick
2;31;9153;120;ﬁxed on the Gryphon, never wavering.;kirkpatrick
2;31;9154;121;No diﬀerently from sun in mirror glass,;kirkpatrick
2;31;9155;122;the twyform beast shone rays into her eyes,;kirkpatrick
2;31;9156;123;displaying one and then the other kind.;kirkpatrick
2;31;9157;124;Reader, just think how great my wonder was;kirkpatrick
2;31;9158;125;to see that creature stilled within itself;kirkpatrick
2;31;9159;126;and yet – within that icon – altering.;kirkpatrick
2;31;9160;127;And, while astounded, yet so full of joy,;kirkpatrick
2;31;9161;128;my soul received the savour of the food;kirkpatrick
2;31;9162;129;that feeds us full and makes us thirst for more,;kirkpatrick
2;31;9163;130;the other three who showed, in all they did,;kirkpatrick
2;31;9164;131;that they were scions of a greater tribe;kirkpatrick
2;31;9165;132;came forward, to their angel’s chant, en loure.;kirkpatrick
2;31;9166;133;‘Turn, Beatrice, turn your holy eyes’;kirkpatrick
2;31;9167;134;(their song went thus) ‘on your most faithful one who, for;kirkpatrick
2;31;9168;135;your sight, has moved so many steps.;kirkpatrick
2;31;9169;136;In grace, we beg, do us the grace to lift;kirkpatrick
2;31;9170;137;the veil that veils your lips so he can tell;kirkpatrick
2;31;9171;138;the second beauty that you still conceal.’;kirkpatrick
2;31;9172;139;Splendour of living and eternal light!;kirkpatrick
2;31;9173;140;Who would not seem – though pale from studying;kirkpatrick
2;31;9174;141;deep in Parnassian shade, whose wells he drinks –  still;kirkpatrick
2;31;9175;142;to be much encumbered in his mind,;kirkpatrick
2;31;9176;143;endeavouring to draw what you then seemed,;kirkpatrick
2;31;9177;144;where heavens in harmony alone enshadow you,;kirkpatrick
2;31;9178;145;as you came forth and showed yourself in air?;kirkpatrick
2;32;9179;1;My eyes were now so ﬁxedly intent;kirkpatrick
2;32;9180;2;to free themselves from that decade-long thirst;kirkpatrick
2;32;9181;3;that every sense but sight had been eclipsed.;kirkpatrick
2;32;9182;4;This side and that, my eyes were walled about;kirkpatrick
2;32;9183;5;with ‘I-don’t-care-at-all’ (the holy smile;kirkpatrick
2;32;9184;6;so drew them to it with its age-old net!),;kirkpatrick
2;32;9185;7;when, by sheer force, my face was turned around;kirkpatrick
2;32;9186;8;towards my left by all those deities,;kirkpatrick
2;32;9187;9;hearing from them a ‘Far too ﬁxedly!’;kirkpatrick
2;32;9188;10;And that debility that’s found in eyes;kirkpatrick
2;32;9189;11;when just now stricken by a blinding sun;kirkpatrick
2;32;9190;12;here left me, for some moments, without sight.;kirkpatrick
2;32;9191;13;But when my eye refocused on the less;kirkpatrick
2;32;9192;14;(the ‘less’ I mean in contrast to that great;kirkpatrick
2;32;9193;15;thing seen from which, with strain, I’d turned away)  the;kirkpatrick
2;32;9194;16;glorious army had, I saw, right-wheeled –;kirkpatrick
2;32;9195;17;those seven ﬂames ahead – to face the sun,;kirkpatrick
2;32;9196;18;and so to make its march towards the east.;kirkpatrick
2;32;9197;19;As, to protect itself, a squadron turns,;kirkpatrick
2;32;9198;20;wheeling beneath its shields around the ﬂag,;kirkpatrick
2;32;9199;21;till every man has made a turnabout,;kirkpatrick
2;32;9200;22;so, too, those troops of that celestial realm;kirkpatrick
2;32;9201;23;that marched in front went by us, rank by rank,;kirkpatrick
2;32;9202;24;before the chariot had turned its pole.;kirkpatrick
2;32;9203;25;The donne then went back beside its wheels.;kirkpatrick
2;32;9204;26;The Gryphon drew its blessèd burden on.;kirkpatrick
2;32;9205;27;And not a single feather stirred or fell.;kirkpatrick
2;32;9206;28;The lovely one who’d drawn me through the pass,;kirkpatrick
2;32;9207;29;Statius and I now followed – at that wheel;kirkpatrick
2;32;9208;30;which, in its orbit, traced the lesser arc.;kirkpatrick
2;32;9209;31;So passing through that deep yet empty grove;kirkpatrick
2;32;9210;32;(the fault of her who trusted in the snake),;kirkpatrick
2;32;9211;33;our steps were measured to the angel song.;kirkpatrick
2;32;9212;34;The distance that, perhaps, we travelled so,;kirkpatrick
2;32;9213;35;was three ﬂights of an arrow when discharged.;kirkpatrick
2;32;9214;36;And Beatrice now, at last, came down.;kirkpatrick
2;32;9215;37;I heard them murmur ‘Adam’, all as one.;kirkpatrick
2;32;9216;38;And then they circled round a leaﬂess tree.;kirkpatrick
2;32;9217;39;Its every branch was stripped of greenery.;kirkpatrick
2;32;9218;40;The crested peak which broadens out the more;kirkpatrick
2;32;9219;41;the more it rises, would, for height, inspire;kirkpatrick
2;32;9220;42;wonder in Hindus in their own great woods.;kirkpatrick
2;32;9221;43;‘Blessèd are you, the Gryphon. With your beak;kirkpatrick
2;32;9222;44;you did not spoil this wood, so sweet to taste.;kirkpatrick
2;32;9223;45;For, after tasting, bellies writhe, all sick.’;kirkpatrick
2;32;9224;46;Around the mighty tree they made this cry.;kirkpatrick
2;32;9225;47;And then the creature, two-formed in its birth:;kirkpatrick
2;32;9226;48;‘In this way, all that’s true and just is saved.’;kirkpatrick
2;32;9227;49;Then, turned towards the pole he’d drawn before,;kirkpatrick
2;32;9228;50;towards the foot of that long-widowed sprig,;kirkpatrick
2;32;9229;51;he tugged it and then left it bound to that.;kirkpatrick
2;32;9230;52;Compare: in spring the great light of the sun;kirkpatrick
2;32;9231;53;cascades on earthly trees conjoined with that;kirkpatrick
2;32;9232;54;which shines out following the astral Carp.;kirkpatrick
2;32;9233;55;These trees then swell. The colour is renewed,;kirkpatrick
2;32;9234;56;in each and all, before the sun moves on;kirkpatrick
2;32;9235;57;to yoke its horses to some other star.;kirkpatrick
2;32;9236;58;So did this tree, whose boughs had hung bereft,;kirkpatrick
2;32;9237;59;take on new strength, in colour opening;kirkpatrick
2;32;9238;60;to more than violet and to less than rose.;kirkpatrick
2;32;9239;61;I did not understand (it’s not sung here);kirkpatrick
2;32;9240;62;the hymn these people sang, nor could I bear;kirkpatrick
2;32;9241;63;in full the beauty of its harmonies.;kirkpatrick
2;32;9242;64;If I could trace the drowsiness that came;kirkpatrick
2;32;9243;65;on hearing Syrinx sung to ruthless eyes –;kirkpatrick
2;32;9244;66;those eyes that wakefulness cost very dear –;kirkpatrick
2;32;9245;67;then, from that model, as a painter paints,;kirkpatrick
2;32;9246;68;I’d draw in my design how I now slept.;kirkpatrick
2;32;9247;69;But that needs someone who can feign sleep well.;kirkpatrick
2;32;9248;70;So I speed on to when I came awake,;kirkpatrick
2;32;9249;71;and say how splendour tore apart sleep’s veil;kirkpatrick
2;32;9250;72;and this cry: ‘Rise! What are you doing there?’;kirkpatrick
2;32;9251;73;When brought to see the budding apple ﬂowers;kirkpatrick
2;32;9252;74;which make the angels greedy for their fruit,;kirkpatrick
2;32;9253;75;and makes in Heaven perpetual marriage feast,;kirkpatrick
2;32;9254;76;Peter and James and John were overcome;kirkpatrick
2;32;9255;77;but, waking once again, they heard that word;kirkpatrick
2;32;9256;78;which shattered greater sleeps than theirs had been,;kirkpatrick
2;32;9257;79;and saw the school they’d sat in two souls short –;kirkpatrick
2;32;9258;80;since Moses and Elijah both had gone –;kirkpatrick
2;32;9259;81;their teacher with his robe now much transformed.;kirkpatrick
2;32;9260;82;So, too, I woke, and saw, above me there,;kirkpatrick
2;32;9261;83;the one who in compassion led my steps;kirkpatrick
2;32;9262;84;along the river sometime earlier.;kirkpatrick
2;32;9263;85;And, full of doubt, I said: ‘Where’s Beatrice?’;kirkpatrick
2;32;9264;86;At which, ‘See there,’ she said, ‘beneath the leaves – now;kirkpatrick
2;32;9265;87;new – she’s seated on the root of that.;kirkpatrick
2;32;9266;88;And see the company that encircles her!;kirkpatrick
2;32;9267;89;The rest behind the Gryphon go on high,;kirkpatrick
2;32;9268;90;singing a deeper, ever sweeter song.’;kirkpatrick
2;32;9269;91;And if her speech ﬂowed further on than this,;kirkpatrick
2;32;9270;92;I do not know. My eyes were set, by now,;kirkpatrick
2;32;9271;93;on her. She’d closed my mind to other thoughts.;kirkpatrick
2;32;9272;94;Alone, she sat upon that one true earth;kirkpatrick
2;32;9273;95;as guard, left there to watch the chariot;kirkpatrick
2;32;9274;96;which, as I’d seen, the two-form beast had tied.;kirkpatrick
2;32;9275;97;The seven nymphs encloistered her around;kirkpatrick
2;32;9276;98;and in their hands all carried lights, secure;kirkpatrick
2;32;9277;99;from Aquilonian or Austral winds.;kirkpatrick
2;32;9278;100;‘With me a while you’ll be a woodsman here;kirkpatrick
2;32;9279;101;and then, with me, a citizen eternally;kirkpatrick
2;32;9280;102;in that new Rome where Christ is Roman, too.;kirkpatrick
2;32;9281;103;And so, to aid the world that lives all wrong,;kirkpatrick
2;32;9282;104;keep your eyes ﬁrmly on the chariot.;kirkpatrick
2;32;9283;105;And what you see write down when you go back.’;kirkpatrick
2;32;9284;106;Thus Beatrice. I myself, devout,;kirkpatrick
2;32;9285;107;touching the feet of all that she ordained,;kirkpatrick
2;32;9286;108;gave eye and mind to where she said I should.;kirkpatrick
2;32;9287;109;No ﬁre that rains from regions farthest oﬀ;kirkpatrick
2;32;9288;110;has, from the densest vapours, struck;kirkpatrick
2;32;9289;111;as rapidly in motion as I saw;kirkpatrick
2;32;9290;112;the Eagle, bird of Jupiter, swoop down;kirkpatrick
2;32;9291;113;straight through the tree, to rip oﬀ all its bark – the;kirkpatrick
2;32;9292;114;ﬂowers as well, and all its new green leaves.;kirkpatrick
2;32;9293;115;It struck the chariot with all its force,;kirkpatrick
2;32;9294;116;making it lurch – a ship in jeopardy,;kirkpatrick
2;32;9295;117;vanquished by windward and then leeward gusts.;kirkpatrick
2;32;9296;118;Within the cradle of the Victory Car;kirkpatrick
2;32;9297;119;I saw a vixen headlong hurl herself,;kirkpatrick
2;32;9298;120;starving, it seemed, for any healthy food.;kirkpatrick
2;32;9299;121;And yet, reproving all her loathsome faults,;kirkpatrick
2;32;9300;122;my lady sent that vixen oﬀ in ﬂight –;kirkpatrick
2;32;9301;123;or such ﬂight as her ﬂeshless bones could bear.;kirkpatrick
2;32;9302;124;But then from where the Eagle ﬁrst had come,;kirkpatrick
2;32;9303;125;I saw it swoop down on the chariot-ark;kirkpatrick
2;32;9304;126;and leave it feathered as it was itself.;kirkpatrick
2;32;9305;127;And then, as coming from some grieving heart,;kirkpatrick
2;32;9306;128;a voice came from the heavens. This voice said:;kirkpatrick
2;32;9307;129;‘My little ship, what ill load weighs you down!’;kirkpatrick
2;32;9308;130;And then, it seemed, the earth beneath both wheels;kirkpatrick
2;32;9309;131;gaped wide. I saw a dragon coming out;kirkpatrick
2;32;9310;132;that thrust its tail deep in the Chariot.;kirkpatrick
2;32;9311;133;And then, as wasps do, drawing out their sting,;kirkpatrick
2;32;9312;134;so did the dragon its malignant tail –;kirkpatrick
2;32;9313;135;tearing out planks – then went oﬀ, wandering.;kirkpatrick
2;32;9314;136;What wood remained, like grass in living earth,;kirkpatrick
2;32;9315;137;with eagle feathers – oﬀered, as may be;kirkpatrick
2;32;9316;138;with generous purpose kindly meant to heal –;kirkpatrick
2;32;9317;139;covered itself once more and covered all,;kirkpatrick
2;32;9318;140;both wheels and pole, within the time it takes;kirkpatrick
2;32;9319;141;for open mouths to breathe the longest sigh.;kirkpatrick
2;32;9320;142;Then, so transformed, the sacred structure sent;kirkpatrick
2;32;9321;143;new heads out all along its many parts,;kirkpatrick
2;32;9322;144;three on the pole and one on all four sides.;kirkpatrick
2;32;9323;145;The ﬁrst three heads were horned as oxen are.;kirkpatrick
2;32;9324;146;The four, though, on their brows bore single horns.;kirkpatrick
2;32;9325;147;No monster like this ever has been seen.;kirkpatrick
2;32;9326;148;As conﬁdent as strongholds in the hills,;kirkpatrick
2;32;9327;149;sitting there now, a loose-wrapped whore appeared, her;kirkpatrick
2;32;9328;150;ﬂickering lashes quick to look around.;kirkpatrick
2;32;9329;151;And then I saw a giant standing by,;kirkpatrick
2;32;9330;152;lest she should ever lift her eyes from him.;kirkpatrick
2;32;9331;153;And every now and then these two would kiss.;kirkpatrick
2;32;9332;154;But since her wandering and cupidinous eye;kirkpatrick
2;32;9333;155;was turned on me, that rabid paramour;kirkpatrick
2;32;9334;156;whipped her ferociously from head to foot.;kirkpatrick
2;32;9335;157;Then, full of jealousy and raw, wild wrath,;kirkpatrick
2;32;9336;158;he loosed the beast and led it through the wood,;kirkpatrick
2;32;9337;159;so far the wood itself now formed a shield;kirkpatrick
2;32;9338;160;between the whore and weird new beast and me.;kirkpatrick
2;33;9339;1;‘Deus, venerunt gentes ,’ – alternating;kirkpatrick
2;33;9340;2;three, then four – the seven donne , weeping;kirkpatrick
2;33;9341;3;gently, sweetly, began to chant that psalm.;kirkpatrick
2;33;9342;4;And Beatrice, sighing in compassion,;kirkpatrick
2;33;9343;5;listened and changed, to hear them, hardly less;kirkpatrick
2;33;9344;6;than Mary did when she stood by the Cross.;kirkpatrick
2;33;9345;7;But when those other virgins granted her;kirkpatrick
2;33;9346;8;a place to speak, she, rising to her feet,;kirkpatrick
2;33;9347;9;responded, ﬁery in her colour, thus:;kirkpatrick
2;33;9348;10;"‘Modicum, et non videbitis me ;";kirkpatrick
2;33;9349;11;et iterum , my most beloved sisters,;kirkpatrick
2;33;9350;12;modicum, et vos videbitis me.’;kirkpatrick
2;33;9351;13;She then sent all those seven on ahead;kirkpatrick
2;33;9352;14;and, with one gesture, brought along behind;kirkpatrick
2;33;9353;15;myself, the lady and the sage who’d stayed.;kirkpatrick
2;33;9354;16;And so she went her way, but had not placed;kirkpatrick
2;33;9355;17;her tenth step on the earth (or so I think);kirkpatrick
2;33;9356;18;before her glance had pierced me, eye to eye.;kirkpatrick
2;33;9357;19;And, calm in countenance, ‘Come on. Be quick,;kirkpatrick
2;33;9358;20;so if I choose,’ she said, ‘to speak to you,;kirkpatrick
2;33;9359;21;you’ll be well placed to hear what I may say.’;kirkpatrick
2;33;9360;22;As soon as I was with her, as I ought,;kirkpatrick
2;33;9361;23;‘Dear brother, now you’re walking by my side,;kirkpatrick
2;33;9362;24;why don’t you seek to question me?’ she said.;kirkpatrick
2;33;9363;25;It happened now to me (it often does;kirkpatrick
2;33;9364;26;to those too reverent with superiors,;kirkpatrick
2;33;9365;27;who can’t get living voice behind their teeth);kirkpatrick
2;33;9366;28;that I began without a full, clear sound:;kirkpatrick
2;33;9367;29;‘My lady, what your need is, you well know,;kirkpatrick
2;33;9368;30;and also what is good to meet that need.’;kirkpatrick
2;33;9369;31;And she to me: ‘From dread and shame alike,;kirkpatrick
2;33;9370;32;I’d have you now at once unknot yourself,;kirkpatrick
2;33;9371;33;so you no longer speak as in a dream.;kirkpatrick
2;33;9372;34;Know this: the vessel that the serpent broke;kirkpatrick
2;33;9373;35;was and is not. But let the guilty one;kirkpatrick
2;33;9374;36;be sure God’s vengeance need not fear grave-sops.;kirkpatrick
2;33;9375;37;The eagle, leaving feathers on the Cart –;kirkpatrick
2;33;9376;38;through which it, ﬁrst, was monster then the prey –;kirkpatrick
2;33;9377;39;will not for ever be without an heir.;kirkpatrick
2;33;9378;40;I see with certainty, and therefore say;kirkpatrick
2;33;9379;41;that stars, secure from obstacle or bar,;kirkpatrick
2;33;9380;42;are drawing near to give to us the hour;kirkpatrick
2;33;9381;43;in which will come FIVE HUNDRED TEN AND FIVE;kirkpatrick
2;33;9382;44;as messenger of God to slay that thief –;kirkpatrick
2;33;9383;45;the giant, too, whom she makes mischief with.;kirkpatrick
2;33;9384;46;It may be that my narrative – as dark;kirkpatrick
2;33;9385;47;as those of Themis and the Sphinx – will blunt;kirkpatrick
2;33;9386;48;(as theirs did), not persuade your intellect.;kirkpatrick
2;33;9387;49;Yet real events will soon prove Naiades,;kirkpatrick
2;33;9388;50;who’ll free you from this enigmatic knot;kirkpatrick
2;33;9389;51;yet bring no harm to grazing sheep or grain.;kirkpatrick
2;33;9390;52;Note well. And, as these words are borne from me,;kirkpatrick
2;33;9391;53;inscribe them for a sign to those who live;kirkpatrick
2;33;9392;54;the life that rapidly runs on to death.;kirkpatrick
2;33;9393;55;And take good care, when you write all this down,;kirkpatrick
2;33;9394;56;that you don’t hide how you have seen the tree,;kirkpatrick
2;33;9395;57;twice over now, stripped bare and robbed of green.;kirkpatrick
2;33;9396;58;Whoever steals from it, or tears its trunk;kirkpatrick
2;33;9397;59;blasphemes, by doing so, against the God;kirkpatrick
2;33;9398;60;who made it sacred for His use alone.;kirkpatrick
2;33;9399;61;Five thousand years and more, the ﬁrst of souls –;kirkpatrick
2;33;9400;62;condemned to yearning pain for biting it –;kirkpatrick
2;33;9401;63;hungered for Him whose own self scourged that bite.;kirkpatrick
2;33;9402;64;Your wits lie sleeping if you do not judge;kirkpatrick
2;33;9403;65;that soaring height, inverted at the top,;kirkpatrick
2;33;9404;66;to be occasioned by some unique cause.;kirkpatrick
2;33;9405;67;And if, around your mind, your own vain thoughts;kirkpatrick
2;33;9406;68;had not been calcifying Elsa streams,;kirkpatrick
2;33;9407;69;their joys like Pyramus to mulberries,;kirkpatrick
2;33;9408;70;then, from its many attributes alone,;kirkpatrick
2;33;9409;71;you, in this allegory, might well have seen;kirkpatrick
2;33;9410;72;that tree to be God’s justice known in bans.;kirkpatrick
2;33;9411;73;But since I see that you, in intellect,;kirkpatrick
2;33;9412;74;are turned to stone and petriﬁed, pure black,;kirkpatrick
2;33;9413;75;hence dazzled by the light of what I say,;kirkpatrick
2;33;9414;76;I wish, as well, that you’ll bear this within –;kirkpatrick
2;33;9415;77;at least as image, not yet written script –;kirkpatrick
2;33;9416;78;as pilgrims bring their staves back wreathed with palms.’;kirkpatrick
2;33;9417;79;And I: ‘No less than wax, I’ll bear the print;kirkpatrick
2;33;9418;80;and never change the shape impressed on it,;kirkpatrick
2;33;9419;81;seeing my brain has now been signed by you.;kirkpatrick
2;33;9420;82;But why so far above my powers of sight;kirkpatrick
2;33;9421;83;does your word, so much longed for, take its ﬂight;kirkpatrick
2;33;9422;84;so that the more it strives it loses more?’;kirkpatrick
2;33;9423;85;‘I ask,’ she said, ‘so you will know how far;kirkpatrick
2;33;9424;86;that school of yours can follow what I say,;kirkpatrick
2;33;9425;87;and see what its philosophy can do,;kirkpatrick
2;33;9426;88;and also that you see how all your ways;kirkpatrick
2;33;9427;89;diverge, as distant from the ways of God;kirkpatrick
2;33;9428;90;as your world is, untuned, from swiftest spheres.’;kirkpatrick
2;33;9429;91;‘I cannot call to mind,’ I answered her,;kirkpatrick
2;33;9430;92;‘that I have ever been estranged from you.;kirkpatrick
2;33;9431;93;My conscience sets sharp teeth in me for that.’;kirkpatrick
2;33;9432;94;‘And if you cannot bring that back to mind,’;kirkpatrick
2;33;9433;95;smiling, she answered me, ‘then just recall;kirkpatrick
2;33;9434;96;you’ve drunk, this very day, from Lethe’s stream.;kirkpatrick
2;33;9435;97;And if, when smoke appears, it proves there’s ﬁre,;kirkpatrick
2;33;9436;98;then this oblivion will itself conclude;kirkpatrick
2;33;9437;99;that guilt once drew your will away, elsewhere.;kirkpatrick
2;33;9438;100;My words must be as naked, after this,;kirkpatrick
2;33;9439;101;as far as they may ﬁttingly unveil;kirkpatrick
2;33;9440;102;themselves to your as-yet-untutored sight.’;kirkpatrick
2;33;9441;103;Its spark more brilliant and with slower step,;kirkpatrick
2;33;9442;104;the sun now held the circle of the noon,;kirkpatrick
2;33;9443;105;which moves (from what one sees) from side to side,;kirkpatrick
2;33;9444;106;when, stopping – as a guide will stop, who goes;kirkpatrick
2;33;9445;107;before the rest as escort if he ﬁnds;kirkpatrick
2;33;9446;108;some novelty or traces of the strange –;kirkpatrick
2;33;9447;109;the donne reached the edges of that shade;kirkpatrick
2;33;9448;110;cast, as in mountains, over chilly streams;kirkpatrick
2;33;9449;111;beneath green leaves and boughs of ebony.;kirkpatrick
2;33;9450;112;Ahead of them, as from a single spring,;kirkpatrick
2;33;9451;113;it seemed I saw the Tigris and Euphrates;kirkpatrick
2;33;9452;114;rise and then part, like friends, reluctantly.;kirkpatrick
2;33;9453;115;‘You light and glory of the human race,;kirkpatrick
2;33;9454;116;what are these waters that, from one sole source,;kirkpatrick
2;33;9455;117;rise up then, spreading, distance each from each?’;kirkpatrick
2;33;9456;118;To this demand: ‘Best ask,’ the answer came,;kirkpatrick
2;33;9457;119;‘Matelda. She’ll reply to you.’ She did –;kirkpatrick
2;33;9458;120;meaning, it seemed, to free herself from blame,;kirkpatrick
2;33;9459;121;saying, that lovely lady: ‘I have told him why.;kirkpatrick
2;33;9460;122;Both this – I’m sure of it – and other things;kirkpatrick
2;33;9461;123;are not concealed from him by Lethe’s stream.’;kirkpatrick
2;33;9462;124;And Beatrice: ‘Maybe greater cares –;kirkpatrick
2;33;9463;125;which often take the memory away –;kirkpatrick
2;33;9464;126;have made his mind grow darker in its view.;kirkpatrick
2;33;9465;127;But see Eunoe, which is ﬂowing there.;kirkpatrick
2;33;9466;128;Lead him to that. And, as you always do,;kirkpatrick
2;33;9467;129;bring back his fainting, half-dead powers to life.’;kirkpatrick
2;33;9468;130;As noble souls incline to do – they make;kirkpatrick
2;33;9469;131;another’s will, without excuse, their will;kirkpatrick
2;33;9470;132;as soon as any sign of that appears –;kirkpatrick
2;33;9471;133;so, too, when I was taken by the hand,;kirkpatrick
2;33;9472;134;the lovely lady made her way and said;kirkpatrick
2;33;9473;135;to Statius, as a donna does: ‘Come, too.’;kirkpatrick
2;33;9474;136;If, reader, I’d more space in which to write,;kirkpatrick
2;33;9475;137;then I should sing in part about that drink,;kirkpatrick
2;33;9476;138;so sweet I’d never have my ﬁll of it.;kirkpatrick
2;33;9477;139;However, since these pages now are full,;kirkpatrick
2;33;9478;140;prepared by rights to take the second song,;kirkpatrick
2;33;9479;141;the reins of art won’t let me pass beyond.;kirkpatrick
2;33;9480;142;I came back from that holiest of waves;kirkpatrick
2;33;9481;143;remade, refreshed as any new tree is,;kirkpatrick
2;33;9482;144;renewed, refreshed with foliage anew,;kirkpatrick
2;33;9483;145;pure and prepared to rise towards the stars.;kirkpatrick
3;1;9484;1;Glory, from Him who moves all things that are,;kirkpatrick
3;1;9485;2;penetrates the universe and then shines back,;kirkpatrick
3;1;9486;3;reﬂected more in one part, less elsewhere.;kirkpatrick
3;1;9487;4;High in that sphere which takes from Him most light;kirkpatrick
3;1;9488;5;I was – I was! – and saw things there that no one who;kirkpatrick
3;1;9489;6;descends knows how or ever can repeat.;kirkpatrick
3;1;9490;7;For, drawing near to what it most desires,;kirkpatrick
3;1;9491;8;our intellect so sinks into the deep;kirkpatrick
3;1;9492;9;no memory can follow it that far.;kirkpatrick
3;1;9493;10;As much, though, truly of that holy realm;kirkpatrick
3;1;9494;11;as I could keep as treasure in my mind;kirkpatrick
3;1;9495;12;will now become the substance of my song.;kirkpatrick
3;1;9496;13;O high Apollo, in this ﬁnal work, make me;kirkpatrick
3;1;9497;14;a vessel of your worth as ﬁne as you;kirkpatrick
3;1;9498;15;demand, in granting longed-for laurel crowns.;kirkpatrick
3;1;9499;16;So far, one summit of Parnassus’ heights;kirkpatrick
3;1;9500;17;has been enough. In this arena, though,;kirkpatrick
3;1;9501;18;the task, as I now enter, calls for both.;kirkpatrick
3;1;9502;19;Enter my heart and breathe in me, as when;kirkpatrick
3;1;9503;20;you ﬂayed defeated Marsyas, and drew;kirkpatrick
3;1;9504;21;that satyr and his limbs from sheathing skin.;kirkpatrick
3;1;9505;22;If you can lend me, from your holy power,;kirkpatrick
3;1;9506;23;enough so I may manifest the shade;kirkpatrick
3;1;9507;24;of that rejoicing realm which marks my head,;kirkpatrick
3;1;9508;25;then to the foot of your beloved bough;kirkpatrick
3;1;9509;26;I’ll come and crown myself with victory leaves – as you;kirkpatrick
3;1;9510;27;and this great theme will ﬁt me to.;kirkpatrick
3;1;9511;28;So seldom (fault and shame of human wills!);kirkpatrick
3;1;9512;29;are these leaves, greatest Father, gathered up;kirkpatrick
3;1;9513;30;to celebrate an emperor or poet.;kirkpatrick
3;1;9514;31;If any, thirsting, freely seeks these fronds;kirkpatrick
3;1;9515;32;(peneian-branched) there must be, in that joyful deity of;kirkpatrick
3;1;9516;33;Delphi, joy born anew.;kirkpatrick
3;1;9517;34;A minute spark precedes a towering ﬂame.;kirkpatrick
3;1;9518;35;Others may be who, after me, will pray;kirkpatrick
3;1;9519;36;with better voice towards Apollo’s hill.;kirkpatrick
3;1;9520;37;Rising, the beacon of the world will come;kirkpatrick
3;1;9521;38;to mortal eyes through many estuaries,;kirkpatrick
3;1;9522;39;but shines where four spheres join three cruciforms;kirkpatrick
3;1;9523;40;with better impetus and better stars,;kirkpatrick
3;1;9524;41;all in conjunction, and, with its own mark,;kirkpatrick
3;1;9525;42;more clearly seals and tempers earthly wax.;kirkpatrick
3;1;9526;43;That surge of sun made morning there, dusk here,;kirkpatrick
3;1;9527;44;and all that hemisphere was almost white;kirkpatrick
3;1;9528;45;while, equally, this other part was dark,;kirkpatrick
3;1;9529;46;when Beatrice turned, as I saw now,;kirkpatrick
3;1;9530;47;towards her left and, turning, set her eyes –;kirkpatrick
3;1;9531;48;no eagle so intent – towards the sun.;kirkpatrick
3;1;9532;49;As any falcon’s searching ﬂight will dive,;kirkpatrick
3;1;9533;50;then strike back up, or else like reﬂex rays,;kirkpatrick
3;1;9534;51;which, angled from the ﬁrst, return on high,;kirkpatrick
3;1;9535;52;so, too, her gesture, pouring through my gaze;kirkpatrick
3;1;9536;53;into imagination, made me turn;kirkpatrick
3;1;9537;54;and ﬁx my eyes – beyond our norm – straight at the sun.;kirkpatrick
3;1;9538;55;Much is permitted there that here, on earth,;kirkpatrick
3;1;9539;56;is not permitted to our human powers,;kirkpatrick
3;1;9540;57;thanks to that place made, properly, our own.;kirkpatrick
3;1;9541;58;I could not bear it long yet did not fail;kirkpatrick
3;1;9542;59;to see, in that brief time, sparks ﬂy around,;kirkpatrick
3;1;9543;60;as iron from a ﬁre when brought to boil.;kirkpatrick
3;1;9544;61;Then suddenly it seemed that day and day;kirkpatrick
3;1;9545;62;were joined, as though – adorned by Him who can – the;kirkpatrick
3;1;9546;63;skies were lighted by a second sun.;kirkpatrick
3;1;9547;64;Beatrice remained, her eyes ﬁxed wholly;kirkpatrick
3;1;9548;65;on the eternal wheels. And my bright glance,;kirkpatrick
3;1;9549;66;turned back from that above, I ﬁxed on her.;kirkpatrick
3;1;9550;67;Held in her look, I, inwardly, was made;kirkpatrick
3;1;9551;68;what Glaucus, tasting grass, was made to be,;kirkpatrick
3;1;9552;69;consorting with the other ocean gods.;kirkpatrick
3;1;9553;70;To give (even in Latin phrase) a meaning;kirkpatrick
3;1;9554;71;to ‘transhuman’ can’t be done. For those whom grace will;kirkpatrick
3;1;9555;72;grant experience, let my case serve.;kirkpatrick
3;1;9556;73;Whether I was no more than soul (which love,;kirkpatrick
3;1;9557;74;in governing the spheres, made lastly new),;kirkpatrick
3;1;9558;75;You know, who raised me up through Your pure light.;kirkpatrick
3;1;9559;76;When that great wheel – which You, desired by that,;kirkpatrick
3;1;9560;77;make sempiternal – had, with harmonies;kirkpatrick
3;1;9561;78;proportionate and clear, made me attend,;kirkpatrick
3;1;9562;79;the skies of Heaven, it seemed to me, blazed out;kirkpatrick
3;1;9563;80;so lit by solar ﬂame no lake on earth,;kirkpatrick
3;1;9564;81;ﬂooded by rain or river, spread so wide.;kirkpatrick
3;1;9565;82;The newness of the sound and that great light;kirkpatrick
3;1;9566;83;kindled in me desire to know the cause;kirkpatrick
3;1;9567;84;sharper than any I have ever felt.;kirkpatrick
3;1;9568;85;And she who saw me as I am, at this,;kirkpatrick
3;1;9569;86;to bring some calm to my excited mind,;kirkpatrick
3;1;9570;87;before I asked her, opening her lips,;kirkpatrick
3;1;9571;88;began to speak: ‘With false imaginings;kirkpatrick
3;1;9572;89;you make yourself so dull you fail to see;kirkpatrick
3;1;9573;90;what, shaking oﬀ this cloud, you’d see quite well.;kirkpatrick
3;1;9574;91;You are not still on earth as you suppose.;kirkpatrick
3;1;9575;92;No thunderbolt that ﬂees its proper place;kirkpatrick
3;1;9576;93;ran at such speed as you return to yours.’;kirkpatrick
3;1;9577;94;If I, by these brief, smiling words of hers,;kirkpatrick
3;1;9578;95;was disinvested of initial doubt,;kirkpatrick
3;1;9579;96;then now by new and greater I was caught.;kirkpatrick
3;1;9580;97;‘I rest content,’ I said, ‘in utmost wonder.;kirkpatrick
3;1;9581;98;So requievi. Yet I wonder now;kirkpatrick
3;1;9582;99;how I climb through these light embodiments.’;kirkpatrick
3;1;9583;100;At this, in deep, aﬀectionate concern,;kirkpatrick
3;1;9584;101;she sighed and set her eyes on me,;kirkpatrick
3;1;9585;102;as mothers do when silly sons rave on.;kirkpatrick
3;1;9586;103;‘There is,’ she now began, ‘an ordered ratio;kirkpatrick
3;1;9587;104;between all things there are. It’s this – such form –;kirkpatrick
3;1;9588;105;that makes the universe resemble God.;kirkpatrick
3;1;9589;106;The highest creatures see the footprints there;kirkpatrick
3;1;9590;107;of God’s eternal prowess and his worth,;kirkpatrick
3;1;9591;108;the end to which (as mentioned here) the rule is made.;kirkpatrick
3;1;9592;109;Within the order I am speaking of,;kirkpatrick
3;1;9593;110;all things, according to their kind, will veer;kirkpatrick
3;1;9594;111;towards their origin, some near, some far.;kirkpatrick
3;1;9595;112;Therefore, across the ocean of “to be”,;kirkpatrick
3;1;9596;113;all natures move towards their diﬀerent ports, each;kirkpatrick
3;1;9597;114;moved by import of a given drive.;kirkpatrick
3;1;9598;115;One instinct bears the ﬁre towards the moon.;kirkpatrick
3;1;9599;116;Another moves all death-bound creatures on.;kirkpatrick
3;1;9600;117;Another grips and uniﬁes the earth.;kirkpatrick
3;1;9601;118;Nor is it only such created things,;kirkpatrick
3;1;9602;119;beyond intelligence, that this bow sends,;kirkpatrick
3;1;9603;120;but also those possessed of love and mind.;kirkpatrick
3;1;9604;121;The providence that integrates the whole;kirkpatrick
3;1;9605;122;makes limpid with its light that heavenly sphere within;kirkpatrick
3;1;9606;123;which rolls the sphere of greatest speed.;kirkpatrick
3;1;9607;124;It bears us now to our appointed place –;kirkpatrick
3;1;9608;125;that bowstring with its power to aim aright;kirkpatrick
3;1;9609;126;whatever it lets ﬂy to happy targets.;kirkpatrick
3;1;9610;127;It’s true, though, just as, often, form will fail;kirkpatrick
3;1;9611;128;to be attuned to what the art intends,;kirkpatrick
3;1;9612;129;since matter, being deaf, will not respond,;kirkpatrick
3;1;9613;130;so, too, a creature which can freely bend;kirkpatrick
3;1;9614;131;will, sometimes, though impelled entirely straight, desert;kirkpatrick
3;1;9615;132;that course and wander oﬀ elsewhere.;kirkpatrick
3;1;9616;133;As lightning ﬂashes fall from thunder clouds,;kirkpatrick
3;1;9617;134;so likewise that ﬁrst impetus strikes down,;kirkpatrick
3;1;9618;135;wrenched wrong by false delight, towards earth.;kirkpatrick
3;1;9619;136;You ought not, if I’m right, be more amazed;kirkpatrick
3;1;9620;137;at rising up than when you see a stream;kirkpatrick
3;1;9621;138;descending from a hill’s crest to its base.;kirkpatrick
3;1;9622;139;The wonder would, in your case be, when free;kirkpatrick
3;1;9623;140;of all impediment, you sat down there –;kirkpatrick
3;1;9624;141;as though live ﬂames on earth were ever still.’;kirkpatrick
3;1;9625;142;With this, she turned once more to face the sky.;kirkpatrick
3;2;9626;1;You in that little boat who, listening hard,;kirkpatrick
3;2;9627;2;have followed, from desire to hear me through,;kirkpatrick
3;2;9628;3;behind my bowsprit singing on its way,;kirkpatrick
3;2;9629;4;now turn, look back and mark your native shores.;kirkpatrick
3;2;9630;5;Do not set out upon these open seas;kirkpatrick
3;2;9631;6;lest losing me you end confused and lost.;kirkpatrick
3;2;9632;7;The waves I ride have never yet been crossed.;kirkpatrick
3;2;9633;8;Minerva breathes. Apollo leads me on.;kirkpatrick
3;2;9634;9;The nine bright Muses point the Ursa-stars.;kirkpatrick
3;2;9635;10;You other few who have already stretched,;kirkpatrick
3;2;9636;11;straight-necked, through time to reach for angel-bread;kirkpatrick
3;2;9637;12;(the food we live by here, unsatisﬁed);kirkpatrick
3;2;9638;13;may to good purpose set your vessel out;kirkpatrick
3;2;9639;14;across the deep salt swell, and plough my wake;kirkpatrick
3;2;9640;15;before the waters level once again.;kirkpatrick
3;2;9641;16;The Argonauts, in glory, Colchis-bound,;kirkpatrick
3;2;9642;17;were not so wonder-struck as you will be;kirkpatrick
3;2;9643;18;when they saw Jason yoked-up to his plough.;kirkpatrick
3;2;9644;19;In-born in being, our perpetual thirst;kirkpatrick
3;2;9645;20;to reach the deiform domain now bore us on;kirkpatrick
3;2;9646;21;as rapid, almost, as the spheres you see.;kirkpatrick
3;2;9647;22;Beatrice looked up. I looked at her.;kirkpatrick
3;2;9648;23;Then maybe in the time an arrow takes;kirkpatrick
3;2;9649;24;to hit the target, ﬂy and slip the notch,;kirkpatrick
3;2;9650;25;I saw I’d come where something marvellous;kirkpatrick
3;2;9651;26;tugged me in sight towards itself. So she;kirkpatrick
3;2;9652;27;(no thought of mine could be concealed from her);kirkpatrick
3;2;9653;28;turning to me, as happy as lovely,;kirkpatrick
3;2;9654;29;‘Direct your mind in thanks,’ she said, ‘to God.;kirkpatrick
3;2;9655;30;For he has made us one with this ﬁrst star.’;kirkpatrick
3;2;9656;31;To me it seemed a cloud now covered us,;kirkpatrick
3;2;9657;32;shining and solid, dense and burnished clean,;kirkpatrick
3;2;9658;33;almost as diamond when the sunlight strikes.;kirkpatrick
3;2;9659;34;Into itself the eternal margarite;kirkpatrick
3;2;9660;35;took us as water will receive a ray;kirkpatrick
3;2;9661;36;of light, remaining, even so, all one.;kirkpatrick
3;2;9662;37;If I was there in body (we can’t grasp;kirkpatrick
3;2;9663;38;how one dimension takes another in,;kirkpatrick
3;2;9664;39;as – body snaked in body – needs must be);kirkpatrick
3;2;9665;40;that should ignite in us still more desire;kirkpatrick
3;2;9666;41;to see that being where, as can be seen,;kirkpatrick
3;2;9667;42;our human nature is at one with God.;kirkpatrick
3;2;9668;43;There we shall see what here we hold in faith,;kirkpatrick
3;2;9669;44;not argued through but known for what it is,;kirkpatrick
3;2;9670;45;as is the primal truth that all believe.;kirkpatrick
3;2;9671;46;‘My lady, as devoutly as I can,;kirkpatrick
3;2;9672;47;I oﬀer Him all thanks,’ I now replied,;kirkpatrick
3;2;9673;48;‘since He here parts me from the mortal world.;kirkpatrick
3;2;9674;49;But tell me what those dark signs are that mark;kirkpatrick
3;2;9675;50;the body of the moon? Down there on earth;kirkpatrick
3;2;9676;51;some folk are led by these to speak of Cain.’;kirkpatrick
3;2;9677;52;She smiled at this a little. Then she said:;kirkpatrick
3;2;9678;53;‘If mortals make mistakes in what they think;kirkpatrick
3;2;9679;54;when sense won’t turn the key of evidence,;kirkpatrick
3;2;9680;55;no dart of wonder ought to pierce you through;kirkpatrick
3;2;9681;56;when you observe, as now, that rational thought –;kirkpatrick
3;2;9682;57;which has to follow sense – is weak of wing.;kirkpatrick
3;2;9683;58;But tell me what your thoughts about this are.’;kirkpatrick
3;2;9684;59;‘That variance,’ I said, ‘so I believe,;kirkpatrick
3;2;9685;60;results from matter being rare or dense.’;kirkpatrick
3;2;9686;61;‘Well,’ she replied, ‘you’ll shortly come to see;kirkpatrick
3;2;9687;62;how deeply out of true your thinking is.;kirkpatrick
3;2;9688;63;If you’ll attend, I’ll put the counter case.;kirkpatrick
3;2;9689;64;The constellations, wheeling, show you many;kirkpatrick
3;2;9690;65;lights. And these, as one may easily discern,;kirkpatrick
3;2;9691;66;present as diﬀerent, both in size and kind.;kirkpatrick
3;2;9692;67;If that were merely caused by “rare” and “dense”;kirkpatrick
3;2;9693;68;there’d be in all one single power of life,;kirkpatrick
3;2;9694;69;distributed at par or more or less.;kirkpatrick
3;2;9695;70;But virtues, in diﬀering, have to be the fruits;kirkpatrick
3;2;9696;71;of diﬀerent formal principles. And these,;kirkpatrick
3;2;9697;72;if you were right, would all, save one, be lost.;kirkpatrick
3;2;9698;73;Consider, too: if rarity explained;kirkpatrick
3;2;9699;74;the dark that you have asked about, then either;kirkpatrick
3;2;9700;75;in part this planet would be starved of stuﬀ,;kirkpatrick
3;2;9701;76;or else, as fat and lean are layered in meat,;kirkpatrick
3;2;9702;77;so this, throughout its volume and extent,;kirkpatrick
3;2;9703;78;would change as pages do within a book.;kirkpatrick
3;2;9704;79;Suppose the ﬁrst were true, then this would show;kirkpatrick
3;2;9705;80;in all eclipses of the sun – as light;kirkpatrick
3;2;9706;81;shines through, behaving as it does in rarities.;kirkpatrick
3;2;9707;82;It doesn’t. So let’s take your second thought.;kirkpatrick
3;2;9708;83;And if, maybe, I also prove this void,;kirkpatrick
3;2;9709;84;then this will give the lie to all you’ve said.;kirkpatrick
3;2;9710;85;If rarity does not extend throughout,;kirkpatrick
3;2;9711;86;it must at some point terminate as, there,;kirkpatrick
3;2;9712;87;its opposite prevents its onward path.;kirkpatrick
3;2;9713;88;The second ray returning from that depth;kirkpatrick
3;2;9714;89;reﬂects like coloured images in glass –;kirkpatrick
3;2;9715;90;when glass has lead plate hidden at its back.;kirkpatrick
3;2;9716;91;But now, you’ll tell me, solar rays shed gloom;kirkpatrick
3;2;9717;92;because in certain parts, at these set points,;kirkpatrick
3;2;9718;93;the light, returning, breaks from further back.;kirkpatrick
3;2;9719;94;Now if you’ll try experiment – from which;kirkpatrick
3;2;9720;95;the rivers of your knowledge always ﬂow –;kirkpatrick
3;2;9721;96;from that objection you will free yourself.;kirkpatrick
3;2;9722;97;Take three reﬂective surfaces. Move two;kirkpatrick
3;2;9723;98;an equal distance oﬀ, the other more,;kirkpatrick
3;2;9724;99;and set your eye between the former two.;kirkpatrick
3;2;9725;100;Now facing them, arrange, behind your back,;kirkpatrick
3;2;9726;101;a source of light to kindle all these three;kirkpatrick
3;2;9727;102;so that it comes struck back to you from each.;kirkpatrick
3;2;9728;103;Although the image in the further glass;kirkpatrick
3;2;9729;104;is less extensive, you are bound to see;kirkpatrick
3;2;9730;105;it shines back equal in intensity.;kirkpatrick
3;2;9731;106;When warming sun rays strike a mass of snow,;kirkpatrick
3;2;9732;107;aqueous valencies will then remain;kirkpatrick
3;2;9733;108;naked of colour and their former chill.;kirkpatrick
3;2;9734;109;Since you in intellect are like that now,;kirkpatrick
3;2;9735;110;I want to form in you a light so live,;kirkpatrick
3;2;9736;111;its shimmering look will tremble to your sight.;kirkpatrick
3;2;9737;112;Circling within the sphere of holy peace,;kirkpatrick
3;2;9738;113;an astral body turns whose power sustains;kirkpatrick
3;2;9739;114;the virtual life of all that it contains.;kirkpatrick
3;2;9740;115;The next sphere (where so many stars are seen);kirkpatrick
3;2;9741;116;shares out such being into diﬀerent modes,;kirkpatrick
3;2;9742;117;each one distinct from, and contained in, that.;kirkpatrick
3;2;9743;118;The seven spheres below in diﬀerent ways;kirkpatrick
3;2;9744;119;dispose the essences each has within;kirkpatrick
3;2;9745;120;towards their proper telos , seed and aim.;kirkpatrick
3;2;9746;121;These living organs of the world thus go,;kirkpatrick
3;2;9747;122;as you can see them now, from grade to grade,;kirkpatrick
3;2;9748;123;receiving from above, forming below.;kirkpatrick
3;2;9749;124;Look closely at the steps I’ll take from here;kirkpatrick
3;2;9750;125;to reach the truth that you so much desire,;kirkpatrick
3;2;9751;126;so you’ll know how to cross this on your own.;kirkpatrick
3;2;9752;127;Motion and virtue in these holy gyres;kirkpatrick
3;2;9753;128;rightly draw breath (as hammer-skill from smith),;kirkpatrick
3;2;9754;129;in turns deriving from angelic moves.;kirkpatrick
3;2;9755;130;The sphere of stars, so ﬁne with all its lights,;kirkpatrick
3;2;9756;131;receives from that deep mind which rolls it round;kirkpatrick
3;2;9757;132;the image that it has, then prints that seal.;kirkpatrick
3;2;9758;133;And as your soul within the dust you are;kirkpatrick
3;2;9759;134;diﬀuses and resolves through diﬀerent limbs,;kirkpatrick
3;2;9760;135;adapting thus to various powers of life,;kirkpatrick
3;2;9761;136;so too angelic intellect unfolds;kirkpatrick
3;2;9762;137;(while turning still round its own unity);kirkpatrick
3;2;9763;138;its goodness multiplied through all the stars.;kirkpatrick
3;2;9764;139;So diﬀerent virtue forms a diﬀerent bond;kirkpatrick
3;2;9765;140;with all those precious bodies that it brings;kirkpatrick
3;2;9766;141;to life – as life in you its strength is bound.;kirkpatrick
3;2;9767;142;Deriving as it does from happy kind,;kirkpatrick
3;2;9768;143;the virtue, fused with body, shines throughout,;kirkpatrick
3;2;9769;144;as joy does in the pupil of the eye.;kirkpatrick
3;2;9770;145;From this there comes – and not from rare or dense –;kirkpatrick
3;2;9771;146;apparent diﬀerences from light to light.;kirkpatrick
3;2;9772;147;That is the formal principle that makes;kirkpatrick
3;2;9773;148;(according to its goodness) clear and cloud.’;kirkpatrick
3;3;9774;1;She – as the sun who ﬁrst in love shone warm;kirkpatrick
3;3;9775;2;into my heart – had now, by proof and counterproof,;kirkpatrick
3;3;9776;3;disclosed to me the lovely face of truth.;kirkpatrick
3;3;9777;4;And being ready, as was only right,;kirkpatrick
3;3;9778;5;to own my errors – and new certainties –;kirkpatrick
3;3;9779;6;I ﬂung my head back, and I meant to speak.;kirkpatrick
3;3;9780;7;But then, it seemed, a vision came to me;kirkpatrick
3;3;9781;8;and bound me up so tightly to itself;kirkpatrick
3;3;9782;9;that these confessions would not come to mind.;kirkpatrick
3;3;9783;10;Compare: from clear and polished panes of glass,;kirkpatrick
3;3;9784;11;or else from glinting waters, calm and still;kirkpatrick
3;3;9785;12;(but not so deep their depths are lost in darkness),  we;kirkpatrick
3;3;9786;13;see reﬂections that reveal a hint,;kirkpatrick
3;3;9787;14;though faint, of our own looks and reach the eye;kirkpatrick
3;3;9788;15;less strongly than a pearl on some white brow.;kirkpatrick
3;3;9789;16;So I saw many faces, keen to speak,;kirkpatrick
3;3;9790;17;and ran now to the opposite mistake;kirkpatrick
3;3;9791;18;from that which ﬁred the love of man and stream.;kirkpatrick
3;3;9792;19;No sooner had I noticed – and supposed;kirkpatrick
3;3;9793;20;that these were seemings in a looking-glass –;kirkpatrick
3;3;9794;21;I turned my eyes to see who these might be.;kirkpatrick
3;3;9795;22;I saw there nothing, so returned my glance;kirkpatrick
3;3;9796;23;straight to the shining-out of my dear guide,;kirkpatrick
3;3;9797;24;who, smiling at me, blazed in her own look.;kirkpatrick
3;3;9798;25;‘You baby!’ she said. ‘Don’t worry or wonder,;kirkpatrick
3;3;9799;26;to see me smile at all these ponderings.;kirkpatrick
3;3;9800;27;Those feet are not yet steady on the ground of truth.;kirkpatrick
3;3;9801;28;Your mind, from habit, turns round to a void.;kirkpatrick
3;3;9802;29;And yet those beings that you see are true,;kirkpatrick
3;3;9803;30;bound here below for vows they disavowed.;kirkpatrick
3;3;9804;31;So speak to them. And hear and trust their words.;kirkpatrick
3;3;9805;32;The light of truth that feeds them with its peace;kirkpatrick
3;3;9806;33;will never let their feet be turned awry.’;kirkpatrick
3;3;9807;34;Now turning to the shadow who most yearned,;kirkpatrick
3;3;9808;35;in love and pure delight, to speak to me,;kirkpatrick
3;3;9809;36;I said, nearly entranced by eagerness:;kirkpatrick
3;3;9810;37;‘You spirit, well created in the rays;kirkpatrick
3;3;9811;38;of this eternity of life, you feel;kirkpatrick
3;3;9812;39;a sweetness never known, if not by taste.;kirkpatrick
3;3;9813;40;Then let me, in your kindness, hear your name,;kirkpatrick
3;3;9814;41;and tell me what all here are destined for.’;kirkpatrick
3;3;9815;42;To which – eyes smiling – she at once replied:;kirkpatrick
3;3;9816;43;‘We, living in God’s love, can no more lock;kirkpatrick
3;3;9817;44;our doors against true-minded aims of will;kirkpatrick
3;3;9818;45;than God’s love does, which wills this court like him.;kirkpatrick
3;3;9819;46;I was a virgin sister in the world.;kirkpatrick
3;3;9820;47;Search deep in memory. My being now;kirkpatrick
3;3;9821;48;more beautiful won’t hide me from your eyes.;kirkpatrick
3;3;9822;49;I am Piccarda – as you’ll know I am –;kirkpatrick
3;3;9823;50;and blessed among the many who are blessed,;kirkpatrick
3;3;9824;51;within this slowest moving of the spheres.;kirkpatrick
3;3;9825;52;The ﬂames of what we feel are lit in us;kirkpatrick
3;3;9826;53;by pleasure purely in the Holy Spirit,;kirkpatrick
3;3;9827;54;dancing for happiness in that design.;kirkpatrick
3;3;9828;55;And though the part allotted us may seem;kirkpatrick
3;3;9829;56;far down, the reason is that, yes, we did;kirkpatrick
3;3;9830;57;neglect our vows. These were in some part void.’;kirkpatrick
3;3;9831;58;‘A wonder shining in the look you have;kirkpatrick
3;3;9832;59;reveals,’ I said, ‘an I-don’t-know of holiness;kirkpatrick
3;3;9833;60;that alters you from how you once were seen.;kirkpatrick
3;3;9834;61;So recognition did not speed to mind.;kirkpatrick
3;3;9835;62;Yet all you say has helped me understand.;kirkpatrick
3;3;9836;63;Your image speaks precisely to me now.;kirkpatrick
3;3;9837;64;But tell me this: you are so happy here,;kirkpatrick
3;3;9838;65;have you no wish to gain some higher grade,;kirkpatrick
3;3;9839;66;to see and be as friends to God still more?’;kirkpatrick
3;3;9840;67;Smiling a moment with the other shades,;kirkpatrick
3;3;9841;68;she then, in utmost happiness, replied,;kirkpatrick
3;3;9842;69;blazing, it seemed, in the ﬁrst ﬁres of love:;kirkpatrick
3;3;9843;70;‘Dear brother, we in will are brought to rest;kirkpatrick
3;3;9844;71;by power of caritas that makes us will;kirkpatrick
3;3;9845;72;no more than what we have, nor thirst for more.;kirkpatrick
3;3;9846;73;Were our desire to be more highly placed,;kirkpatrick
3;3;9847;74;all our desires would then be out of tune;kirkpatrick
3;3;9848;75;with His, who knows and wills where we should be.;kirkpatrick
3;3;9849;76;Yet discord in these spheres cannot occur –;kirkpatrick
3;3;9850;77;as you, if you reﬂect on this, will see –;kirkpatrick
3;3;9851;78;since charity is a priori here.;kirkpatrick
3;3;9852;79;In formal terms, our being in beatitude;kirkpatrick
3;3;9853;80;entails in-holding to the will of God,;kirkpatrick
3;3;9854;81;our own wills thus made one with the divine.;kirkpatrick
3;3;9855;82;In us, therefore, there is, throughout this realm,;kirkpatrick
3;3;9856;83;a placing, rung to rung, delighting all;kirkpatrick
3;3;9857;84;– our king as well in-willing us in will.;kirkpatrick
3;3;9858;85;In His volition is the peace we have.;kirkpatrick
3;3;9859;86;That is the sea to which all being moves,;kirkpatrick
3;3;9860;87;be it what that creates or Nature blends.’;kirkpatrick
3;3;9861;88;Now it was clear. I saw that everywhere;kirkpatrick
3;3;9862;89;in Paradise there’s Heaven, though grace may rain;kirkpatrick
3;3;9863;90;in varied measure from the Highest Good.;kirkpatrick
3;3;9864;91;But then, as often happens over food;kirkpatrick
3;3;9865;92;(though satisﬁed with one, we crave the next,;kirkpatrick
3;3;9866;93;reaching for that while still we’re saying ‘thanks’),  so;kirkpatrick
3;3;9867;94;now in word and gesture I betrayed;kirkpatrick
3;3;9868;95;an eagerness to hear from her what weave;kirkpatrick
3;3;9869;96;her spool had not yet drawn out to the end.;kirkpatrick
3;3;9870;97;‘Perfect in life, her merits raised on high,;kirkpatrick
3;3;9871;98;there is a lady – more in-heavened than we –;kirkpatrick
3;3;9872;99;who wrote, on earth, a Rule of dress and veil,;kirkpatrick
3;3;9873;100;that lets its wearer sleep and wake till death;kirkpatrick
3;3;9874;101;beside a husband who accepts those vows;kirkpatrick
3;3;9875;102;that charity conforms to his delight.;kirkpatrick
3;3;9876;103;To follow her, I ﬂed – a girl, no more –;kirkpatrick
3;3;9877;104;out of the world. I pulled her cowl to me,;kirkpatrick
3;3;9878;105;and promised my obedience to that Rule.;kirkpatrick
3;3;9879;106;Men now arrived, more set on harm than good.;kirkpatrick
3;3;9880;107;They dragged me from the cloister I had loved,;kirkpatrick
3;3;9881;108;and God well knows what then my life became.;kirkpatrick
3;3;9882;109;But, over to my right, there shows to you;kirkpatrick
3;3;9883;110;another splendour who, enkindled now;kirkpatrick
3;3;9884;111;with all the light that gathers in our sphere,;kirkpatrick
3;3;9885;112;knows from her own life what I say of mine.;kirkpatrick
3;3;9886;113;She was our sister. And from her head, too,;kirkpatrick
3;3;9887;114;was torn the shadow of her pure, white hood.;kirkpatrick
3;3;9888;115;This is the light of Constance, that high queen;kirkpatrick
3;3;9889;116;who bore to Swabia’s second storm a son,;kirkpatrick
3;3;9890;117;the third – and ultimate – of that great line.;kirkpatrick
3;3;9891;118;And yet – although against her will, against;kirkpatrick
3;3;9892;119;all decency – she went back to the world,;kirkpatrick
3;3;9893;120;she never let the veil fall from her heart.’;kirkpatrick
3;3;9894;121;Those were her words to me. But then ‘Ave;kirkpatrick
3;3;9895;122;Maria’ began, singing. And, singing,;kirkpatrick
3;3;9896;123;she went from sight, as weight sinks deep in water.;kirkpatrick
3;3;9897;124;My eyes pursued as far as eyesight can,;kirkpatrick
3;3;9898;125;but, as I lost her, so I turned once more;kirkpatrick
3;3;9899;126;to target a desire far greater still.;kirkpatrick
3;3;9900;127;Now all my thoughts were ﬁxed on Beatrice.;kirkpatrick
3;3;9901;128;But she, as lightning strikes, so stunned my gaze,;kirkpatrick
3;3;9902;129;my eyes at ﬁrst could not support the sight,;kirkpatrick
3;3;9903;130;and this was why my question came so slow.;kirkpatrick
3;4;9904;1;Between two equidistant portions, equally;kirkpatrick
3;4;9905;2;moving, if free to choose, you’d starve to death;kirkpatrick
3;4;9906;3;before you’d carried either to your teeth.;kirkpatrick
3;4;9907;4;So, too, some lamb might stand between the bite;kirkpatrick
3;4;9908;5;of hungry wolves, fearing them both alike.;kirkpatrick
3;4;9909;6;So, too, a hound would stand between two does.;kirkpatrick
3;4;9910;7;If, therefore, I kept silence now, I neither;kirkpatrick
3;4;9911;8;criticize nor praise myself. Driven by doubts;kirkpatrick
3;4;9912;9;of equal measure, this was necessity.;kirkpatrick
3;4;9913;10;I still kept silent. Yet my keen desire;kirkpatrick
3;4;9914;11;was painted – and my questions, too – within my eyes,;kirkpatrick
3;4;9915;12;warmer by far than well-formed words could speak.;kirkpatrick
3;4;9916;13;So Beatrice did as Daniel did;kirkpatrick
3;4;9917;14;to free Nebuchadnezzar from the rage;kirkpatrick
3;4;9918;15;that made him cruel beyond all rational need.;kirkpatrick
3;4;9919;16;‘I clearly see,’ she said, ‘how two desires;kirkpatrick
3;4;9920;17;fret you as you take aim. Your own concerns;kirkpatrick
3;4;9921;18;constrain themselves. You cannot breathe them out.;kirkpatrick
3;4;9922;19;Your thinking runs: “If will-to-good endures,;kirkpatrick
3;4;9923;20;how, then, can violence wrought by other hands;kirkpatrick
3;4;9924;21;reduce in me the measure of desert?”;kirkpatrick
3;4;9925;22;A further reason for your doubt is this:;kirkpatrick
3;4;9926;23;our souls return, or so it may appear,;kirkpatrick
3;4;9927;24;as Plato in his teaching says, to stars.;kirkpatrick
3;4;9928;25;These are the questions that, with equal weight,;kirkpatrick
3;4;9929;26;point, in volition, hard upon your mind.;kirkpatrick
3;4;9930;27;I’ll ﬁrst treat that which is more poisonous.;kirkpatrick
3;4;9931;28;The most in-god-ed of the Seraphim,;kirkpatrick
3;4;9932;29;Moses and Samuel – and either John;kirkpatrick
3;4;9933;30;you care to mention – even Maria,;kirkpatrick
3;4;9934;31;none is enthroned in any other sphere;kirkpatrick
3;4;9935;32;than those souls are who’ve just appeared to you.;kirkpatrick
3;4;9936;33;Nor are their years, existing, more or less.;kirkpatrick
3;4;9937;34;All add in beauty to the highest gyre.;kirkpatrick
3;4;9938;35;Some sense the eternal breathing more, some less.;kirkpatrick
3;4;9939;36;So life is sweet to all in diﬀering ways.;kirkpatrick
3;4;9940;37;They did, here, show themselves, but not because;kirkpatrick
3;4;9941;38;this sphere has been allotted them as theirs.;kirkpatrick
3;4;9942;39;They signify celestial power least raised.;kirkpatrick
3;4;9943;40;To speak in this way ﬁts the human mind.;kirkpatrick
3;4;9944;41;For you can only grasp through things you’ve sensed what;kirkpatrick
3;4;9945;42;mind will then present as ﬁt for thought.;kirkpatrick
3;4;9946;43;For this same reason, Scripture condescends;kirkpatrick
3;4;9947;44;to your capacities, and says that God;kirkpatrick
3;4;9948;45;has hands and feet – though meaning otherwise.;kirkpatrick
3;4;9949;46;So, Holy Church will also represent;kirkpatrick
3;4;9950;47;Michael and Gabriel with human face,;kirkpatrick
3;4;9951;48;the other, too, who helped heal Tobit’s sight.;kirkpatrick
3;4;9952;49;But Plato in Timaeus “On the soul”;kirkpatrick
3;4;9953;50;argues a case at odds with that seen here.;kirkpatrick
3;4;9954;51;For what he says, it seems, has literal force.;kirkpatrick
3;4;9955;52;He says that souls go back to their own stars,;kirkpatrick
3;4;9956;53;believing them to be excised from these,;kirkpatrick
3;4;9957;54;when Nature granted each its proper form.;kirkpatrick
3;4;9958;55;This doctrine, though, perhaps conceals a sense;kirkpatrick
3;4;9959;56;quite other than these words of his pronounce,;kirkpatrick
3;4;9960;57;with implications we should not deride.;kirkpatrick
3;4;9961;58;If Plato means that, back to join these wheels,;kirkpatrick
3;4;9962;59;there comes the blame or honour of their power,;kirkpatrick
3;4;9963;60;perhaps his bow shot hits upon some truth.;kirkpatrick
3;4;9964;61;And yet, misunderstood, this principle;kirkpatrick
3;4;9965;62;wrenched almost all the world oﬀ course. So Jove and;kirkpatrick
3;4;9966;63;Mars and Mercury were named as gods.;kirkpatrick
3;4;9967;64;The other doubt, so troubling you, is not;kirkpatrick
3;4;9968;65;as venomous. The injury it does;kirkpatrick
3;4;9969;66;can’t lead you elsewhere and away from me.;kirkpatrick
3;4;9970;67;That justice in our realm, to mortal eyes,;kirkpatrick
3;4;9971;68;should seem unjust concerns you in regard;kirkpatrick
3;4;9972;69;to faith. It’s not some vicious heresy.;kirkpatrick
3;4;9973;70;But since you have the subtlety of mind;kirkpatrick
3;4;9974;71;yourself to penetrate the truth of this,;kirkpatrick
3;4;9975;72;I shall, since you desire it, tell you all.;kirkpatrick
3;4;9976;73;If “violence” is done when those who’re harmed;kirkpatrick
3;4;9977;74;bring nothing of their own to outside force,;kirkpatrick
3;4;9978;75;these souls, though blessèd, aren’t exempt from blame.;kirkpatrick
3;4;9979;76;Free will, unless it wills, cannot be quenched;kirkpatrick
3;4;9980;77;but acts like Nature in a rising ﬂame;kirkpatrick
3;4;9981;78;even though torn by force a thousand times.;kirkpatrick
3;4;9982;79;But if it bends – whatever the degree –;kirkpatrick
3;4;9983;80;it follows force. These women, though they could;kirkpatrick
3;4;9984;81;have ﬂed to holy ground, did bend like this.;kirkpatrick
3;4;9985;82;Had they, in what they willed, stood absolute,;kirkpatrick
3;4;9986;83;as did Saint Lawrence on the burning coals,;kirkpatrick
3;4;9987;84;or Mucius – harsh towards his own right hand –;kirkpatrick
3;4;9988;85;their wills would then have thrust them, once released,;kirkpatrick
3;4;9989;86;back on the road from which they’d just been drawn.;kirkpatrick
3;4;9990;87;But will as ﬁrm as that is very rare.;kirkpatrick
3;4;9991;88;These words (suppose you’ve listened as you ought);kirkpatrick
3;4;9992;89;will leave the case regarding what is just;kirkpatrick
3;4;9993;90;– which often would have irked you – null and void.;kirkpatrick
3;4;9994;91;Yet now, across the path before your eyes,;kirkpatrick
3;4;9995;92;appears another obstacle. And you yourself –;kirkpatrick
3;4;9996;93;you’d quickly tire – could not get free from this.;kirkpatrick
3;4;9997;94;I’ve ﬁxed within your mind this certainty:;kirkpatrick
3;4;9998;95;that souls in Paradise can never lie.;kirkpatrick
3;4;9999;96;They all are, always, close to primal truth.;kirkpatrick
3;4;10000;97;But then you might have heard Piccarda say;kirkpatrick
3;4;10001;98;that Constance kept her heart set on the veil,;kirkpatrick
3;4;10002;99;And so, it seems, she contradicts me here.;kirkpatrick
3;4;10003;100;It has, my dearest brother, often been;kirkpatrick
3;4;10004;101;that things, in ﬂeeing danger, have been done,;kirkpatrick
3;4;10005;102;counter to choice, that were not right to do,;kirkpatrick
3;4;10006;103;as when, responding to his father’s prayer,;kirkpatrick
3;4;10007;104;Alcmaeon slew his mother for revenge,;kirkpatrick
3;4;10008;105;and, not to fail in piety, proved pitiless.;kirkpatrick
3;4;10009;106;I want you, in such cases, to be clear;kirkpatrick
3;4;10010;107;that will conjoins with violence. And so,;kirkpatrick
3;4;10011;108;for these oﬀences there is no excuse.;kirkpatrick
3;4;10012;109;Will does not, in the absolute, consent to harm.;kirkpatrick
3;4;10013;110;It does consent, however, in degrees of fear,;kirkpatrick
3;4;10014;111;lest, drawing back, it falls to more distress.;kirkpatrick
3;4;10015;112;So when Piccarda makes the point she does,;kirkpatrick
3;4;10016;113;she means the will as absolute while I;kirkpatrick
3;4;10017;114;intend the other. We, as one, speak truth.’;kirkpatrick
3;4;10018;115;These waves came ﬂooding from that holy stream;kirkpatrick
3;4;10019;116;that rises at the source of every truth.;kirkpatrick
3;4;10020;117;As such, they set my two desires to rest.;kirkpatrick
3;4;10021;118;‘Goddess, belovèd of the loving First!;kirkpatrick
3;4;10022;119;Your words in waves,’ I said, ‘ﬂow into me.;kirkpatrick
3;4;10023;120;They warm me through, and light me more and more.;kirkpatrick
3;4;10024;121;No feeling I possess is deep enough;kirkpatrick
3;4;10025;122;to make return to you, in grace for grace.;kirkpatrick
3;4;10026;123;But He who sees – and can – will answer so.;kirkpatrick
3;4;10027;124;I see full well that human intellect;kirkpatrick
3;4;10028;125;can never be content unless that truth;kirkpatrick
3;4;10029;126;beyond which no truth soars shines down on it.;kirkpatrick
3;4;10030;127;When once they come to it, as come they may,;kirkpatrick
3;4;10031;128;minds couch in truth as beasts do in their lairs.;kirkpatrick
3;4;10032;129;Were that not so, then all desire would fail.;kirkpatrick
3;4;10033;130;Born of that will, there rise up, like fresh shoots,;kirkpatrick
3;4;10034;131;pure doubts. These ﬂourish at the foot of truth.;kirkpatrick
3;4;10035;132;From height to height, they drive us to the peak.;kirkpatrick
3;4;10036;133;This beckons me. This makes me very sure;kirkpatrick
3;4;10037;134;that I, my lady, may in reverence seek;kirkpatrick
3;4;10038;135;another truth that still is dark to me.;kirkpatrick
3;4;10039;136;I want to know if we can make amends;kirkpatrick
3;4;10040;137;with other goods when vows go unfulﬁlled,;kirkpatrick
3;4;10041;138;so these will not seem meagre in your scale.’;kirkpatrick
3;4;10042;139;Now Beatrice looked at me with eyes all full;kirkpatrick
3;4;10043;140;of sparks of speaking love, and so divine;kirkpatrick
3;4;10044;141;that, overwhelmed, I turned my back on her;kirkpatrick
3;4;10045;142;and, eyes bowed down, I almost lost myself.;kirkpatrick
3;5;10046;1;‘If I ﬂame out in warmth of love to you;kirkpatrick
3;5;10047;2;beyond all measure that is seen on earth,;kirkpatrick
3;5;10048;3;and so defeat the prowess of your eyes,;kirkpatrick
3;5;10049;4;don’t wonder why. This light in me proceeds;kirkpatrick
3;5;10050;5;from perfect sight, which, once it apprehends;kirkpatrick
3;5;10051;6;the good, will dance on, apprehending that.;kirkpatrick
3;5;10052;7;Already I see well in your own mind;kirkpatrick
3;5;10053;8;the mirrored splendour of eternal light;kirkpatrick
3;5;10054;9;which seen will kindle – only, always – love.;kirkpatrick
3;5;10055;10;And if your love is teased to other things,;kirkpatrick
3;5;10056;11;then these are nothing but the merest trace,;kirkpatrick
3;5;10057;12;ill understood, of that light shining through.;kirkpatrick
3;5;10058;13;You wish to know if, when a vow falls short,;kirkpatrick
3;5;10059;14;some other service might be rendered up;kirkpatrick
3;5;10060;15;to keep that soul secure from legal charge.’;kirkpatrick
3;5;10061;16;So Beatrice’s song began this canto,;kirkpatrick
3;5;10062;17;and then, as one who makes no break in speech,;kirkpatrick
3;5;10063;18;continued in the sacred process thus:;kirkpatrick
3;5;10064;19;‘The greatest gift that God, in spacious deed,;kirkpatrick
3;5;10065;20;made, all-creating – and most nearly formed;kirkpatrick
3;5;10066;21;to His liberality, most prized by Him –;kirkpatrick
3;5;10067;22;was liberty in actions of the will,;kirkpatrick
3;5;10068;23;with which all creatures of intelligence –;kirkpatrick
3;5;10069;24;and they alone – both were and are endowed.;kirkpatrick
3;5;10070;25;Now there’ll appear, if you pursue this thought,;kirkpatrick
3;5;10071;26;the value and nobility of vows,;kirkpatrick
3;5;10072;27;when framed so God’s consent consents with yours.;kirkpatrick
3;5;10073;28;For in a pact conﬁrmed by God and man;kirkpatrick
3;5;10074;29;the treasured gift I speak of is itself;kirkpatrick
3;5;10075;30;made sacriﬁce, made thus by its own act.;kirkpatrick
3;5;10076;31;And so what restitution can there be?;kirkpatrick
3;5;10077;32;You think you’ll make good use of what you gave?;kirkpatrick
3;5;10078;33;Well, that’s to try good works with stolen cash.;kirkpatrick
3;5;10079;34;So now you’re certain of the major point.;kirkpatrick
3;5;10080;35;But since our Holy Church can loose a vow –;kirkpatrick
3;5;10081;36;which seems quite counter to the truth I’ve told –  you’ll;kirkpatrick
3;5;10082;37;need to sit a while more at this feast.;kirkpatrick
3;5;10083;38;The meat that you have taken on is tough.;kirkpatrick
3;5;10084;39;It needs some help if you’re to get it down.;kirkpatrick
3;5;10085;40;Open your mind to what I’ll now declare;kirkpatrick
3;5;10086;41;and grasp it inwardly. To understand;kirkpatrick
3;5;10087;42;won’t count as knowledge if it’s not retained.;kirkpatrick
3;5;10088;43;Essential in a sacriﬁcial vow;kirkpatrick
3;5;10089;44;are two considerations: what we’ll do ,;kirkpatrick
3;5;10090;45;then, formally, the fact that we agree.;kirkpatrick
3;5;10091;46;Per se , agreements, save when carried through,;kirkpatrick
3;5;10092;47;cannot be nulliﬁed. And that, above,;kirkpatrick
3;5;10093;48;was what, precisely, was made clear to you.;kirkpatrick
3;5;10094;49;The Hebrews of necessity were thus;kirkpatrick
3;5;10095;50;required to make appropriate oﬀerings,;kirkpatrick
3;5;10096;51;though some, as you should know, were modiﬁed.;kirkpatrick
3;5;10097;52;The second aspect (“substance”, as deﬁned);kirkpatrick
3;5;10098;53;may properly be varied, so no blame;kirkpatrick
3;5;10099;54;attaches in the change to other things.;kirkpatrick
3;5;10100;55;Do not, though, shift the burden from your back;kirkpatrick
3;5;10101;56;by any mere decision of your own.;kirkpatrick
3;5;10102;57;A priest must turn both white and yellow keys.;kirkpatrick
3;5;10103;58;All changes – please believe – are idiotic;kirkpatrick
3;5;10104;59;unless the principle and substitute;kirkpatrick
3;5;10105;60;stand in a ratio of four to six.;kirkpatrick
3;5;10106;61;When ﬁrst vows, therefore, are of so much weight;kirkpatrick
3;5;10107;62;that they, in value, twist the scales awry,;kirkpatrick
3;5;10108;63;one cannot quit the charge by substitutes.;kirkpatrick
3;5;10109;64;So mortals should not take facetious oaths.;kirkpatrick
3;5;10110;65;Be faithful. But in being so, don’t squint –;kirkpatrick
3;5;10111;66;like Jephthah, pledging his “good day” to death.;kirkpatrick
3;5;10112;67;Better for him if he had said: “I’m wrong,”;kirkpatrick
3;5;10113;68;than do worse doing it. Stupid as well,;kirkpatrick
3;5;10114;69;the chieftain of the Greeks, as you can see.;kirkpatrick
3;5;10115;70;For him, in sacriﬁce, Iphigenia rinsed;kirkpatrick
3;5;10116;71;her lovely face in tears, and caused to weep;kirkpatrick
3;5;10117;72;both foolish men and wise at such observances.;kirkpatrick
3;5;10118;73;Christians, be weightier in moving vows.;kirkpatrick
3;5;10119;74;Don’t ﬂutter on every breeze like feathers.;kirkpatrick
3;5;10120;75;And don’t suppose that every vow will cleanse.;kirkpatrick
3;5;10121;76;You have the Testaments, both Old and New,;kirkpatrick
3;5;10122;77;a shepherd in the Church to be your guide.;kirkpatrick
3;5;10123;78;That is enough for your salvation here.;kirkpatrick
3;5;10124;79;If wrongful appetites yell otherwise,;kirkpatrick
3;5;10125;80;you are still human, not such brain-dead sheep;kirkpatrick
3;5;10126;81;as make the Jews among you laugh aloud.;kirkpatrick
3;5;10127;82;Don’t imitate those silly, wayward lambs;kirkpatrick
3;5;10128;83;who wander from their mother’s milk, and ﬁght;kirkpatrick
3;5;10129;84;only against themselves for sheer delight.’;kirkpatrick
3;5;10130;85;So Beatrice (as I write) to me.;kirkpatrick
3;5;10131;86;And then she, all desiring, turned once more;kirkpatrick
3;5;10132;87;to where the universe shines liveliest.;kirkpatrick
3;5;10133;88;Her saying nothing now and changing look;kirkpatrick
3;5;10134;89;imposed a silence on my avid mind,;kirkpatrick
3;5;10135;90;which had already new demands ahead.;kirkpatrick
3;5;10136;91;And so, as when some arrow hits its mark;kirkpatrick
3;5;10137;92;before the string that shot it comes to rest,;kirkpatrick
3;5;10138;93;we ran on swiftly to the second realm.;kirkpatrick
3;5;10139;94;And here, on entering that heavenly light,;kirkpatrick
3;5;10140;95;I, on the instant, saw in her such joy;kirkpatrick
3;5;10141;96;the star itself at that shone brighter still.;kirkpatrick
3;5;10142;97;And if the planet changed its form and laughed,;kirkpatrick
3;5;10143;98;then what of me, being, as mortals are,;kirkpatrick
3;5;10144;99;so prone in every way to transmutation.;kirkpatrick
3;5;10145;100;Compare: in ﬁsh pools that are still and clear,;kirkpatrick
3;5;10146;101;the ﬁsh are drawn – as though they guess at food – to;kirkpatrick
3;5;10147;102;anything that comes there from outside.;kirkpatrick
3;5;10148;103;So now I saw a thousand splendours plus;kirkpatrick
3;5;10149;104;drawing towards us. And in each was heard:;kirkpatrick
3;5;10150;105;‘Look there! He’ll make our many loves grow more.’;kirkpatrick
3;5;10151;106;And then, as each came near to us, each shade;kirkpatrick
3;5;10152;107;was seen – within the ﬂash of clarity;kirkpatrick
3;5;10153;108;that came from each – full of pure happiness.;kirkpatrick
3;5;10154;109;Readers, just think if what we’ve now begun;kirkpatrick
3;5;10155;110;did not go on, what torment it would be;kirkpatrick
3;5;10156;111;to hunger, wanting further information.;kirkpatrick
3;5;10157;112;Imagine that, and then you, too, will see;kirkpatrick
3;5;10158;113;my great desire, when these came to my eyes,;kirkpatrick
3;5;10159;114;to hear from them what their conditions were.;kirkpatrick
3;5;10160;115;‘O you, born well! To you is granted grace;kirkpatrick
3;5;10161;116;to see the thrones of triumph in eternity;kirkpatrick
3;5;10162;117;before your soldiership on earth is done.;kirkpatrick
3;5;10163;118;The ray that soars through all these heavenly skies;kirkpatrick
3;5;10164;119;sets us ablaze. And so, if you desire;kirkpatrick
3;5;10165;120;clear words concerning us, please take your ﬁll.’;kirkpatrick
3;5;10166;121;These words were uttered by one holy soul.;kirkpatrick
3;5;10167;122;From Beatrice: ‘Speak! Just get it said.;kirkpatrick
3;5;10168;123;Be conﬁdent. Believe them as though gods.’;kirkpatrick
3;5;10169;124;‘You make your nest, as I can see, within;kirkpatrick
3;5;10170;125;a light that, drawn from your own eyes,;kirkpatrick
3;5;10171;126;is yours alone. It glitters as you smile.;kirkpatrick
3;5;10172;127;But still I do not know, you honoured soul,;kirkpatrick
3;5;10173;128;who you all are, why ranked in Mercury,;kirkpatrick
3;5;10174;129;the sphere that sun rays veil from mortal eyes.’;kirkpatrick
3;5;10175;130;I spoke directly to that source of light,;kirkpatrick
3;5;10176;131;the ﬁrst to speak to me. And this itself now shone with far;kirkpatrick
3;5;10177;132;more brilliance than it did before.;kirkpatrick
3;5;10178;133;Compare: the sun, when heat has worn away;kirkpatrick
3;5;10179;134;the tempering inﬂuence of a vapour cloud,;kirkpatrick
3;5;10180;135;conceals itself in overwhelming light.;kirkpatrick
3;5;10181;136;So now, in greater joy, that holy form;kirkpatrick
3;5;10182;137;hid himself from me in his own bright ray;kirkpatrick
3;5;10183;138;and, thus enclosed, enclosed he spoke to me;kirkpatrick
3;5;10184;139;to chant the chant the following canto sings.;kirkpatrick
3;6;10185;1;‘Since Constantine ﬁrst turned the Eagle’s ﬂight;kirkpatrick
3;6;10186;2;against the path, east–west, that Heaven’s course takes,;kirkpatrick
3;6;10187;3;(once followed by the Patriarch who chose, as wife,;kirkpatrick
3;6;10188;4;Lavinia) a hundred years and then a hundred more,;kirkpatrick
3;6;10189;5;God’s bird had kept to Europe’s farthest bounds,;kirkpatrick
3;6;10190;6;close by the mountains of its origin.;kirkpatrick
3;6;10191;7;Under the shadow of its sacred plumes,;kirkpatrick
3;6;10192;8;from hand to hand it governed all the world,;kirkpatrick
3;6;10193;9;and came by due succession into mine.;kirkpatrick
3;6;10194;10;I, emperor once, am now Justinian.;kirkpatrick
3;6;10195;11;And by the will of primal love – which I know here – I;kirkpatrick
3;6;10196;12;purged our laws of emptiness and dross.;kirkpatrick
3;6;10197;13;Before I set my mind upon this work,;kirkpatrick
3;6;10198;14;I’d thought of Christ as single and divine –;kirkpatrick
3;6;10199;15;not truly man – contented in that faith.;kirkpatrick
3;6;10200;16;But then the blessed Agapetus – shepherd;kirkpatrick
3;6;10201;17;supreme – led me, by words of his, aright,;kirkpatrick
3;6;10202;18;to ﬁnd pure faith, unsullied and complete.;kirkpatrick
3;6;10203;19;I trusted him, believed him, and now see;kirkpatrick
3;6;10204;20;what he in faith upheld – as clear as you,;kirkpatrick
3;6;10205;21;by logic, prove one thought is false, one true.;kirkpatrick
3;6;10206;22;As soon as I walked onward with the Church,;kirkpatrick
3;6;10207;23;then God so pleased, through grace, to breathe in me the;kirkpatrick
3;6;10208;24;great design on which I set all thought.;kirkpatrick
3;6;10209;25;My troops I gave in trust to Belisarius;kirkpatrick
3;6;10210;26;and Heaven’s right hand allied itself with his.;kirkpatrick
3;6;10211;27;These triumphs were a sign to settle thus.;kirkpatrick
3;6;10212;28;This answer punctuates your ﬁrst demand.;kirkpatrick
3;6;10213;29;But, even so, these words imply much more.;kirkpatrick
3;6;10214;30;I’m therefore bound to add a further note,;kirkpatrick
3;6;10215;31;so you can see how right those are (Oh yes!;kirkpatrick
3;6;10216;32;So right!) to move against that holiest of signs,;kirkpatrick
3;6;10217;33;to challenge it or claim it as their own.;kirkpatrick
3;6;10218;34;Look at its powers! These make all reverence due,;kirkpatrick
3;6;10219;35;these virtues that were born in that same hour;kirkpatrick
3;6;10220;36;when, dying, Pallas gained the Sign its realm.;kirkpatrick
3;6;10221;37;The Eagle dwelt in Alba (as you’ll know);kirkpatrick
3;6;10222;38;three hundred years or more until, at last,;kirkpatrick
3;6;10223;39;Three fought with three, to win that Sign for Rome.;kirkpatrick
3;6;10224;40;You also know what deeds, through seven reigns,;kirkpatrick
3;6;10225;41;the great sign wrought (the Sabine wound,;kirkpatrick
3;6;10226;42;Lucretia’s grief), defeating tribes around.;kirkpatrick
3;6;10227;43;You know its exploits, borne by Roman pride,;kirkpatrick
3;6;10228;44;against the Brenner Gaul and Pyrrhus, too,;kirkpatrick
3;6;10229;45;against all other princedoms, states or guilds.;kirkpatrick
3;6;10230;46;Torquatus, Quintus (known, for unkempt hair,;kirkpatrick
3;6;10231;47;as “Tousel-head”), the Decii and Fabians,;kirkpatrick
3;6;10232;48;all these won fame which here I gladly laud.;kirkpatrick
3;6;10233;49;The Eagle, too, laid low the Arab boast;kirkpatrick
3;6;10234;50;that passed, in steps that followed Hannibal,;kirkpatrick
3;6;10235;51;the alpine cliﬀs from which, great Po, you glide.;kirkpatrick
3;6;10236;52;Beneath that Sign, young Scipio won his crown,;kirkpatrick
3;6;10237;53;young Pompey, too. And bitter it appeared;kirkpatrick
3;6;10238;54;to that great hill beneath which you were born.;kirkpatrick
3;6;10239;55;Then near the time when all the heavens willed;kirkpatrick
3;6;10240;56;to lead the world back to serenity,;kirkpatrick
3;6;10241;57;Caesar, by will of Rome, took up the Sign.;kirkpatrick
3;6;10242;58;And then Isère and Loire and Seine beheld,;kirkpatrick
3;6;10243;59;from Var to Rhine, what that could do – and all;kirkpatrick
3;6;10244;60;those streaming valleys that supply the Rhône.;kirkpatrick
3;6;10245;61;And then it left Ravenna and achieved,;kirkpatrick
3;6;10246;62;leaping the Rubicon, such things in ﬂight;kirkpatrick
3;6;10247;63;that neither tongue nor pen could seek to trace.;kirkpatrick
3;6;10248;64;Next, towards Spain it swung its warrior might,;kirkpatrick
3;6;10249;65;then to Durazzo in Albania.;kirkpatrick
3;6;10250;66;It struck Farsalia. And hot Nile felt the pain.;kirkpatrick
3;6;10251;67;Atandros, then, and Simois (whence it sprang);kirkpatrick
3;6;10252;68;it saw once more, and Hector’s resting place.;kirkpatrick
3;6;10253;69;And then to Ptolemy’s harm it shook its wings,;kirkpatrick
3;6;10254;70;then fell on Juba, ﬂashing thunder bolts.;kirkpatrick
3;6;10255;71;From there it turned towards your western realms;kirkpatrick
3;6;10256;72;and heard Pompean trumpets sounding there.;kirkpatrick
3;6;10257;73;For all it bore through its next stewardship,;kirkpatrick
3;6;10258;74;Brutus in Hell and Cassius both bark.;kirkpatrick
3;6;10259;75;And Modena – Perugia, too – once grieved for that.;kirkpatrick
3;6;10260;76;Sad Cleopatra also weeps for it.;kirkpatrick
3;6;10261;77;By snake bite, ﬂeeing as that Sign advanced,;kirkpatrick
3;6;10262;78;she met her sudden and atrocious death.;kirkpatrick
3;6;10263;79;Then, carried in Augustus’ hand, it ran;kirkpatrick
3;6;10264;80;towards the Red Sea coast and brought such peace;kirkpatrick
3;6;10265;81;to all the world that Janus’s shrine was locked.;kirkpatrick
3;6;10266;82;Yet everything that Sign (which moves my speech);kirkpatrick
3;6;10267;83;had done till now, or then went on to do,;kirkpatrick
3;6;10268;84;throughout the mortal realm that lies in thrall,;kirkpatrick
3;6;10269;85;is seemingly but little and obscure;kirkpatrick
3;6;10270;86;if now, clear-sightedly, with heart made pure,;kirkpatrick
3;6;10271;87;you look in wonder at Tiberius’ hands.;kirkpatrick
3;6;10272;88;For, to the hands of that third emperor,;kirkpatrick
3;6;10273;89;the Living Justice that inspires me now;kirkpatrick
3;6;10274;90;granted the glory to avenge His ire.;kirkpatrick
3;6;10275;91;Now look in wonder at my counter charge:;kirkpatrick
3;6;10276;92;the Sign then ran, in Titus’s reign, to take;kirkpatrick
3;6;10277;93;due vengeance for the ancient sin avenged.;kirkpatrick
3;6;10278;94;And when the godless teeth of Lombard hordes;kirkpatrick
3;6;10279;95;bit deep in Holy Church, then Charlemagne,;kirkpatrick
3;6;10280;96;victorious beneath its wings, brought aid.;kirkpatrick
3;6;10281;97;You can now pass a judgement on all those,;kirkpatrick
3;6;10282;98;with all their faults, whom I accused above,;kirkpatrick
3;6;10283;99;the cause of all the ills that fall on you.;kirkpatrick
3;6;10284;100;Some set, against that universal Sign,;kirkpatrick
3;6;10285;101;their tinsel lilies, while the rest will claim;kirkpatrick
3;6;10286;102;the Sign’s their own. Hard, this: who’s more to blame?;kirkpatrick
3;6;10287;103;Let them go on, the Ghibellines, and ply;kirkpatrick
3;6;10288;104;their craft beneath some other sign than this.;kirkpatrick
3;6;10289;105;All, prising it from justice, serve it ill.;kirkpatrick
3;6;10290;106;Nor let the Guelfs of upstart Charles Anjou;kirkpatrick
3;6;10291;107;assail that Sign but rather fear those claws;kirkpatrick
3;6;10292;108;that ripped the hide from prouder whelps than these.;kirkpatrick
3;6;10293;109;Children, as often happens, rue in tears;kirkpatrick
3;6;10294;110;the crimes their fathers did. Don’t think that God will;kirkpatrick
3;6;10295;111;change his lawful arms to lily ﬂowers.;kirkpatrick
3;6;10296;112;This little star is ﬁnely ﬁtted out;kirkpatrick
3;6;10297;113;with souls who, noble in their deeds, still sought that fame;kirkpatrick
3;6;10298;114;and honour should live after them.;kirkpatrick
3;6;10299;115;But when desires incline to aim at that,;kirkpatrick
3;6;10300;116;the rays of truthful love – thus wandering oﬀ –;kirkpatrick
3;6;10301;117;must needs incline, above, to lesser life.;kirkpatrick
3;6;10302;118;To calculate the balance, though, between;kirkpatrick
3;6;10303;119;reward and merit is a part, for us,;kirkpatrick
3;6;10304;120;of happiness, seeing there’s neither more nor less.;kirkpatrick
3;6;10305;121;Thus Living Justice sweetly shapes and ﬁts;kirkpatrick
3;6;10306;122;a longing for the good within our hearts,;kirkpatrick
3;6;10307;123;so this cannot be wrenched to any wrong.;kirkpatrick
3;6;10308;124;As, diﬀering, voices sing a sweet-tuned chord,;kirkpatrick
3;6;10309;125;so, too, in our life here, from diﬀering thrones, sweet;kirkpatrick
3;6;10310;126;harmonies are sent through all these wheels.;kirkpatrick
3;6;10311;127;And here, within this pearl that ﬂowers for you,;kirkpatrick
3;6;10312;128;there shines the shining light of Romeo,;kirkpatrick
3;6;10313;129;whose deeds, so ﬁne and good, were ill-received.;kirkpatrick
3;6;10314;130;Those lords, though, of Provence, opposed to him,;kirkpatrick
3;6;10315;131;well, they’ve no cause. They’ll come to grief,;kirkpatrick
3;6;10316;132;taking amiss another’s virtuous deeds.;kirkpatrick
3;6;10317;133;Four daughters had he, Raymond Berengar.;kirkpatrick
3;6;10318;134;Each was a queen. And everything was done;kirkpatrick
3;6;10319;135;by Romeo, that strange and humble traveller.;kirkpatrick
3;6;10320;136;Then slanderous tongues led Raymond to demand;kirkpatrick
3;6;10321;137;a full account of this most honest man,;kirkpatrick
3;6;10322;138;who’d paid him back for ten at seven plus ﬁve.;kirkpatrick
3;6;10323;139;So, destitute and aged, he left that shore.;kirkpatrick
3;6;10324;140;But if the world had only known his heart,;kirkpatrick
3;6;10325;141;begging his life away from crust to crust,;kirkpatrick
3;7;10326;1;‘Osanna, sanctus Deus sabaòth ,;kirkpatrick
3;7;10327;2;superillustrans claritate tua;kirkpatrick
3;7;10328;3;felices ignes horum malacòth!’;kirkpatrick
3;7;10329;4;Thus – circling on himself, to his own tune –;kirkpatrick
3;7;10330;5;was seen by me the singing of that ens ,;kirkpatrick
3;7;10331;6;a double light as two-ing over him.;kirkpatrick
3;7;10332;7;Into their dance they moved, this light and all.;kirkpatrick
3;7;10333;8;And then with utter speed, like sparks of ﬁre,;kirkpatrick
3;7;10334;9;they veiled themselves from me in sudden distance.;kirkpatrick
3;7;10335;10;I, still in doubt, was saying: ‘Tell her! Tell her!’;kirkpatrick
3;7;10336;11;within myself still saying: ‘Tell my lady!;kirkpatrick
3;7;10337;12;Her words drop sweet and take my thirst away.’;kirkpatrick
3;7;10338;13;Yet awe of her – its power en-ladying;kirkpatrick
3;7;10339;14;the whole of me, hearing no more than ‘Be—’ or ‘—ice’ –;kirkpatrick
3;7;10340;15;kept me, as though some drowsy soul, head down.;kirkpatrick
3;7;10341;16;She did not suﬀer me to be so long,;kirkpatrick
3;7;10342;17;but now began, arraying round me there;kirkpatrick
3;7;10343;18;a smile to make men happy in Hell’s ﬁre:;kirkpatrick
3;7;10344;19;‘As I, to look at you, can tell unerringly,;kirkpatrick
3;7;10345;20;a doubt has ﬁxed in you: how vengeance might,;kirkpatrick
3;7;10346;21;in justice, fall on vengeance justly wrought?;kirkpatrick
3;7;10347;22;But I shall quickly free your mind from knots.;kirkpatrick
3;7;10348;23;Attend to me. The words I am to speak;kirkpatrick
3;7;10349;24;will bring you doctrine of the greatest weight.;kirkpatrick
3;7;10350;25;Because the unborn ﬁrst of men would bear;kirkpatrick
3;7;10351;26;no curb, for his own good, on power of will,;kirkpatrick
3;7;10352;27;damning himself, he damned all born to him.;kirkpatrick
3;7;10353;28;The human race, because of this, lay sick –;kirkpatrick
3;7;10354;29;great error deepening down the centuries –;kirkpatrick
3;7;10355;30;until it pleased the Logos to descend;kirkpatrick
3;7;10356;31;to where our nature, long abandoning;kirkpatrick
3;7;10357;32;its maker, was made one, as person , with Him,;kirkpatrick
3;7;10358;33;by action solely of eternal love.;kirkpatrick
3;7;10359;34;Now ﬁx your eye on what we’re now to say.;kirkpatrick
3;7;10360;35;This nature, with its maker once at one,;kirkpatrick
3;7;10361;36;once was, without addition, pure and good,;kirkpatrick
3;7;10362;37;but then was banished of its own accord;kirkpatrick
3;7;10363;38;from Paradise. For, of itself, it turned aside;kirkpatrick
3;7;10364;39;from its own life, from truth – its proper road.;kirkpatrick
3;7;10365;40;The sentence, therefore, that the Cross imposed,;kirkpatrick
3;7;10366;41;if measured by the nature thus assumed,;kirkpatrick
3;7;10367;42;was just and true. No pain was ever more.;kirkpatrick
3;7;10368;43;Conversely, none, unjustly, did such harm,;kirkpatrick
3;7;10369;44;considering what person bore the pain,;kirkpatrick
3;7;10370;45;conjoined within a nature such as that.;kirkpatrick
3;7;10371;46;Thus from the self-same act ﬂowed diﬀerent things.;kirkpatrick
3;7;10372;47;One death delighted both the Jews and God.;kirkpatrick
3;7;10373;48;At this earth trembled, Heaven opened wide.;kirkpatrick
3;7;10374;49;You should not, therefore, ﬁnd it hard to see;kirkpatrick
3;7;10375;50;why vengeance, in itself completely just,;kirkpatrick
3;7;10376;51;was then avenged by action of just court.;kirkpatrick
3;7;10377;52;But now once more I see that mind of yours;kirkpatrick
3;7;10378;53;is knotted up, and snags from thought to thought.;kirkpatrick
3;7;10379;54;You wait in great desire to be set loose.;kirkpatrick
3;7;10380;55;“I understand,” you say, “what I have heard.;kirkpatrick
3;7;10381;56;But this to me is hidden still, why God;kirkpatrick
3;7;10382;57;for our redemption willed this way alone?”;kirkpatrick
3;7;10383;58;That ordinance, dear brother, lies entombed,;kirkpatrick
3;7;10384;59;unseen by anyone whose mind, as yet,;kirkpatrick
3;7;10385;60;is immature, untempered by love’s ﬂame.;kirkpatrick
3;7;10386;61;For all that – since so many aim at this,;kirkpatrick
3;7;10387;62;yet very few are clear about their mark –;kirkpatrick
3;7;10388;63;I’ll tell you why that way was right and ﬁnest.;kirkpatrick
3;7;10389;64;The generosity of God which scorns;kirkpatrick
3;7;10390;65;all spite and meanness burns within itself,;kirkpatrick
3;7;10391;66;yet, ﬂaring out, unfolds eternal beauties.;kirkpatrick
3;7;10392;67;Whatever – without second cause – distils;kirkpatrick
3;7;10393;68;directly from the source of good can have;kirkpatrick
3;7;10394;69;no end. Stamped thus by good, the print won’t move.;kirkpatrick
3;7;10395;70;Whatever – without a second cause – rains down;kirkpatrick
3;7;10396;71;from good is wholly free, and does not lie;kirkpatrick
3;7;10397;72;subjected to the power of things new-made.;kirkpatrick
3;7;10398;73;Conformed to good, it pleases good the more.;kirkpatrick
3;7;10399;74;That holy ﬁre, whose rays strike everything,;kirkpatrick
3;7;10400;75;lives brightest in what most resembles it.;kirkpatrick
3;7;10401;76;The human creature thrives, endowed with all;kirkpatrick
3;7;10402;77;these gifts and beneﬁts. But if one fails;kirkpatrick
3;7;10403;78;it must be that its dignity will fall.;kirkpatrick
3;7;10404;79;And sin alone deprives it of its freedoms;kirkpatrick
3;7;10405;80;by rendering it unlike the highest good,;kirkpatrick
3;7;10406;81;so that it whitens little in that gleam.;kirkpatrick
3;7;10407;82;Nor can it ever regain dignity;kirkpatrick
3;7;10408;83;without replenishing what guilt makes vain,;kirkpatrick
3;7;10409;84;with just amends to match its false delight.;kirkpatrick
3;7;10410;85;Your nature in its seed sinned totally ,;kirkpatrick
3;7;10411;86;and so from all these honours was removed –;kirkpatrick
3;7;10412;87;as was it also out of Paradise.;kirkpatrick
3;7;10413;88;Nor could these honours ever be restored;kirkpatrick
3;7;10414;89;unless – if you will note this subtlety –;kirkpatrick
3;7;10415;90;it made its way through one of these two fords:;kirkpatrick
3;7;10416;91;either that God, in all his courteous grace,;kirkpatrick
3;7;10417;92;should freely pardon us, or man himself;kirkpatrick
3;7;10418;93;should oﬀer satisfaction for such madness.;kirkpatrick
3;7;10419;94;Now point your penetrating eye within;kirkpatrick
3;7;10420;95;the chasm of eternal Mind, and ﬁx;kirkpatrick
3;7;10421;96;on what I say as tightly as you can.;kirkpatrick
3;7;10422;97;Mankind could not, within its natural bounds,;kirkpatrick
3;7;10423;98;"give satisfaction, ever; none could fall,";kirkpatrick
3;7;10424;99;obedient in humility, as far;kirkpatrick
3;7;10425;100;as, disobeying, it had sought to rise.;kirkpatrick
3;7;10426;101;That is the reason why the way was closed;kirkpatrick
3;7;10427;102;for man to oﬀer proper satisfaction.;kirkpatrick
3;7;10428;103;So this was right: that God by His own means;kirkpatrick
3;7;10429;104;should bring us back to fullness in our lives,;kirkpatrick
3;7;10430;105;by one way or – I’d say – by both at once.;kirkpatrick
3;7;10431;106;But since an act will please the agent more;kirkpatrick
3;7;10432;107;the more it represents to view the heart;kirkpatrick
3;7;10433;108;of generosity from which it ﬂowed,;kirkpatrick
3;7;10434;109;so, too, that holy generosity;kirkpatrick
3;7;10435;110;which stamps the universe chose happily;kirkpatrick
3;7;10436;111;in all His ways to raise you up once more.;kirkpatrick
3;7;10437;112;Between the last great night and ﬁrst of days;kirkpatrick
3;7;10438;113;there’s never been nor shall be, either way,;kirkpatrick
3;7;10439;114;a process soaring, so magniﬁcent.;kirkpatrick
3;7;10440;115;For God, in giving of Himself to make;kirkpatrick
3;7;10441;116;humanity suﬃcient to restore itself,;kirkpatrick
3;7;10442;117;gave more than, granting pardon, He’d have done.;kirkpatrick
3;7;10443;118;All other means, in justice, would have come;kirkpatrick
3;7;10444;119;far short, had not the very Son of God;kirkpatrick
3;7;10445;120;bowed humbly down to take on human ﬂesh.;kirkpatrick
3;7;10446;121;So now to make you see as I do here;kirkpatrick
3;7;10447;122;and bring to their fulﬁlment your desires,;kirkpatrick
3;7;10448;123;go back and clarify a certain point.;kirkpatrick
3;7;10449;124;“I see,” you’ll say, “the waters. And I see;kirkpatrick
3;7;10450;125;ﬁre, air and earth and all their compounds fail, come to;kirkpatrick
3;7;10451;126;decay and last no time at all.;kirkpatrick
3;7;10452;127;Yet these were creatures in creation, too.;kirkpatrick
3;7;10453;128;And so, if what you’ve told me is the truth,;kirkpatrick
3;7;10454;129;these likewise should be safe from gross decay.”;kirkpatrick
3;7;10455;130;The angels, and this pure place where you are,;kirkpatrick
3;7;10456;131;rightly are known, dear brother, as “created” –;kirkpatrick
3;7;10457;132;their being formed complete as they are now.;kirkpatrick
3;7;10458;133;But all those elements that you have named,;kirkpatrick
3;7;10459;134;and everything that might be made from them,;kirkpatrick
3;7;10460;135;are formed as such by some created power.;kirkpatrick
3;7;10461;136;Matter, which they possess, was thus “created”,;kirkpatrick
3;7;10462;137;“Created”, too, the power informing them,;kirkpatrick
3;7;10463;138;descending from the stars that circle round.;kirkpatrick
3;7;10464;139;As mere “complected” possibility,;kirkpatrick
3;7;10465;140;the very souls of beasts and growing things;kirkpatrick
3;7;10466;141;draw light and motion from the sacred stars.;kirkpatrick
3;7;10467;142;But your life – through no second cause – is breathed;kirkpatrick
3;7;10468;143;by Highest Goodness which then brings that life;kirkpatrick
3;7;10469;144;to love such good and always long for it.;kirkpatrick
3;7;10470;145;And from this principle you may infer;kirkpatrick
3;7;10471;146;the resurrection you yourselves will have.;kirkpatrick
3;7;10472;147;Return and think how human ﬂesh was made;kirkpatrick
3;7;10473;148;when our ﬁrst parents were themselves made live.’;kirkpatrick
3;8;10474;1;The world, while still in danger, once believed;kirkpatrick
3;8;10475;2;that Venus (lovely Cyprian), whirling;kirkpatrick
3;8;10476;3;through Epicyclon Three, rayed down mad love,;kirkpatrick
3;8;10477;4;so that, in age-old error, folk of old;kirkpatrick
3;8;10478;5;did her all honour. And not her alone.;kirkpatrick
3;8;10479;6;In sacriﬁce and cries of supplication,;kirkpatrick
3;8;10480;7;they, for her sake, would honour Dione;kirkpatrick
3;8;10481;8;(mother to her), and Cupid, too (her son,;kirkpatrick
3;8;10482;9;who sat, their stories said, in Dido’s lap).;kirkpatrick
3;8;10483;10;From her – as I now pluck my opening line –;kirkpatrick
3;8;10484;11;they took her name, and gave it to the star;kirkpatrick
3;8;10485;12;whose love-looks at the sun touch nape then brow.;kirkpatrick
3;8;10486;13;I had no sense of rising there. And yet;kirkpatrick
3;8;10487;14;my faith at being now within, she made;kirkpatrick
3;8;10488;15;quite sure: I saw my lady lovelier.;kirkpatrick
3;8;10489;16;As ﬁre-ﬂecks in a ﬂame can still be seen,;kirkpatrick
3;8;10490;17;as voices voiced in chorus sound distinct;kirkpatrick
3;8;10491;18;when one, while others vary, holds its note,;kirkpatrick
3;8;10492;19;so in that light I now saw torches lit;kirkpatrick
3;8;10493;20;that ran in moving spirals – quick, less quick,;kirkpatrick
3;8;10494;21;according, I suppose, to inward sight.;kirkpatrick
3;8;10495;22;From chill-compacted clouds no wind – unseen;kirkpatrick
3;8;10496;23;or seen – has ever shot so swiftly down;kirkpatrick
3;8;10497;24;as not to seem arrested, loaded, slow,;kirkpatrick
3;8;10498;25;to anyone who’d seen these holy lights;kirkpatrick
3;8;10499;26;(as they came up to us) who left the gyre;kirkpatrick
3;8;10500;27;that starts among the highest Seraphim.;kirkpatrick
3;8;10501;28;And deep in those who earliest appeared;kirkpatrick
3;8;10502;29;there sounded an ‘Hosanna’, so, then on,;kirkpatrick
3;8;10503;30;I lacked no urge to hear it once again.;kirkpatrick
3;8;10504;31;Then one of these, approaching closer still,;kirkpatrick
3;8;10505;32;began, alone: ‘We all are quick to hear;kirkpatrick
3;8;10506;33;what you might please, so you’ll delight in us.;kirkpatrick
3;8;10507;34;We turn at one with royal celestial lords,;kirkpatrick
3;8;10508;35;one single spire, one spiralling, one thirst.;kirkpatrick
3;8;10509;36;You, in the world, addressed those angels thus:;kirkpatrick
3;8;10510;37;“O you whose intellection moves Sphere Three …”;kirkpatrick
3;8;10511;38;We, being full of love, are no less pleased;kirkpatrick
3;8;10512;39;to rest a while, to please you, than to move.’;kirkpatrick
3;8;10513;40;Towards my lady, ﬁrst, in reverence;kirkpatrick
3;8;10514;41;I bowed my eyes and, once she’d granted them;kirkpatrick
3;8;10515;42;agreement and assurance of herself,;kirkpatrick
3;8;10516;43;I turned again towards that source of light;kirkpatrick
3;8;10517;44;which had, before, made promise of so much,;kirkpatrick
3;8;10518;45;my voice impressed with longing warmth: ‘Who are you?’;kirkpatrick
3;8;10519;46;How, with new happiness, in strength and kind,;kirkpatrick
3;8;10520;47;that light, when I addressed it, now increased,;kirkpatrick
3;8;10521;48;adding more happiness to what it had!;kirkpatrick
3;8;10522;49;So, altered now, he said to me: ‘The world;kirkpatrick
3;8;10523;50;held me, down there, no time at all. Had that;kirkpatrick
3;8;10524;51;been more, much ill to come would not have been.;kirkpatrick
3;8;10525;52;My happiness conceals me from you still.;kirkpatrick
3;8;10526;53;Its rays shine round me, and they keep me hid,;kirkpatrick
3;8;10527;54;as though some creature swathed in its own silk.;kirkpatrick
3;8;10528;55;You loved me well – and with good reason, too.;kirkpatrick
3;8;10529;56;For were I still down there, I would have shown;kirkpatrick
3;8;10530;57;far more of how I love you than leaf-green.;kirkpatrick
3;8;10531;58;The leftward bank rinsed clean by ﬂowing Rhône;kirkpatrick
3;8;10532;59;(before that river mingles with the Sorgue);kirkpatrick
3;8;10533;60;awaited me, my hour now come, as lord,;kirkpatrick
3;8;10534;61;so, too, the Ausonian Horn (its fortresses;kirkpatrick
3;8;10535;62;are Bari, Croton and Gaeta) stretched;kirkpatrick
3;8;10536;63;between where Tronto and Verde reach the sea.;kirkpatrick
3;8;10537;64;There gleamed already on my brows the crown;kirkpatrick
3;8;10538;65;of regions that the Danube irrigates –;kirkpatrick
3;8;10539;66;when once it leaves behind its German shores.;kirkpatrick
3;8;10540;67;Trinacria (lovely Sicily) where fumes;kirkpatrick
3;8;10541;68;of sulphur, born from Etna’s core – so not;kirkpatrick
3;8;10542;69;breathed out by giant Typhoeus – form;kirkpatrick
3;8;10543;70;in that gulf, whipped up by Eurus gusts,;kirkpatrick
3;8;10544;71;between the capes Pachynus and Peloras,;kirkpatrick
3;8;10545;72;would still have looked for princes born as heirs,;kirkpatrick
3;8;10546;73;through me, to Charles and Rudolph, had misrule –;kirkpatrick
3;8;10547;74;which chafes upon a subject race – not stirred;kirkpatrick
3;8;10548;75;Palermo’s scream: “Death to them French. Death! Death!”;kirkpatrick
3;8;10549;76;And would my brother only look ahead,;kirkpatrick
3;8;10550;77;he’d learn to ﬂee the tight-wad neediness;kirkpatrick
3;8;10551;78;of Catalonian ministers and not get hurt.;kirkpatrick
3;8;10552;79;For he – or someone – ought to take that view,;kirkpatrick
3;8;10553;80;lest loading up his now well-laden ship,;kirkpatrick
3;8;10554;81;his cargo of extortion prove too great.;kirkpatrick
3;8;10555;82;His temperament, the mean descendant;kirkpatrick
3;8;10556;83;of a generous race, has need of oﬃcers;kirkpatrick
3;8;10557;84;who do not strive to line their treasure chests.’;kirkpatrick
3;8;10558;85;‘Because, my lord, the soaring happiness;kirkpatrick
3;8;10559;86;your words pour into me is seen, I think,;kirkpatrick
3;8;10560;87;by you, where all that’s good begins and ends,;kirkpatrick
3;8;10561;88;as clearly as I see it in myself,;kirkpatrick
3;8;10562;89;it’s yet more welcome, and I prize it well,;kirkpatrick
3;8;10563;90;since you behold it gazing back to God.;kirkpatrick
3;8;10564;91;You’ve made me light of heart. Now make me clear,;kirkpatrick
3;8;10565;92;since, speaking, you have brought this doubt to me: how;kirkpatrick
3;8;10566;93;can it be that sweet seed leads to sour?’;kirkpatrick
3;8;10567;94;So I to him. He in reply: ‘If only;kirkpatrick
3;8;10568;95;I can show you truth, you’ll hold your eyes;kirkpatrick
3;8;10569;96;to what you ask where now your shoulders are.;kirkpatrick
3;8;10570;97;The Good, which turns the whole domain you climb;kirkpatrick
3;8;10571;98;and brings it joy, forms from its providence;kirkpatrick
3;8;10572;99;the power that works in all these cosmic limbs.;kirkpatrick
3;8;10573;100;Nor is the way things are alone foreseen;kirkpatrick
3;8;10574;101;within that mind, which of itself is whole,;kirkpatrick
3;8;10575;102;but equally how each thing best may thrive.;kirkpatrick
3;8;10576;103;And so, whatever bolt this bow may shoot;kirkpatrick
3;8;10577;104;will arc down, shaped towards an end foreseen,;kirkpatrick
3;8;10578;105;as things do when directed to their mark.;kirkpatrick
3;8;10579;106;Were this not so, the spheres you journey through;kirkpatrick
3;8;10580;107;would bring all their eﬀects about in ways;kirkpatrick
3;8;10581;108;that count as chaos, not as skill or art.;kirkpatrick
3;8;10582;109;And that can’t be – unless the angel-minds;kirkpatrick
3;8;10583;110;that move these stars were failing in their acts – the ﬁrst;kirkpatrick
3;8;10584;111;as well, for not perfecting them.;kirkpatrick
3;8;10585;112;This truth – you’d have me make it shine still more?’;kirkpatrick
3;8;10586;113;I: ‘Not at all. It is, I see, impossible;kirkpatrick
3;8;10587;114;that Nature, at that need, should ever tire.’;kirkpatrick
3;8;10588;115;So he once more: ‘For those who live on earth,;kirkpatrick
3;8;10589;116;would it be worse if they weren’t citizens?’;kirkpatrick
3;8;10590;117;‘Yes,’ I replied. ‘And here I don’t ask why.’;kirkpatrick
3;8;10591;118;‘And could it be that men should live down there;kirkpatrick
3;8;10592;119;except by diﬀerence in their diﬀerent tasks?;kirkpatrick
3;8;10593;120;By no means – if your teacher writes the truth.’;kirkpatrick
3;8;10594;121;He’d reached this point by formal argument,;kirkpatrick
3;8;10595;122;and then, concluding: ‘It must therefore be;kirkpatrick
3;8;10596;123;that there are diﬀering roots for what you do.;kirkpatrick
3;8;10597;124;So one is born as Xerxes, one as Solon.;kirkpatrick
3;8;10598;125;One is Melchizedek, another still;kirkpatrick
3;8;10599;126;the craftsman, borne on air, who lost his son.;kirkpatrick
3;8;10600;127;All-circling Nature who imprints the stamp;kirkpatrick
3;8;10601;128;on mortal wax performs her function well,;kirkpatrick
3;8;10602;129;and won’t distinguish hostels high and low.;kirkpatrick
3;8;10603;130;So Esau happens, by his astral seed,;kirkpatrick
3;8;10604;131;to diﬀer from his twin, while Romulus;kirkpatrick
3;8;10605;132;was born so low that Mars was made his sire.;kirkpatrick
3;8;10606;133;The course of generated things would run;kirkpatrick
3;8;10607;134;unchanged in nature from their generants,;kirkpatrick
3;8;10608;135;if not defeated by God’s providence.;kirkpatrick
3;8;10609;136;Now that which lay behind you stands ahead.;kirkpatrick
3;8;10610;137;But so you’ll know your joyous use to me,;kirkpatrick
3;8;10611;138;I’d have you robed in this corollary:;kirkpatrick
3;8;10612;139;like any seed not sown in native soil,;kirkpatrick
3;8;10613;140;Nature, on ﬁnding fortune out of tune,;kirkpatrick
3;8;10614;141;will always give poor proof of what it is.;kirkpatrick
3;8;10615;142;And if the earthly world would set its mind;kirkpatrick
3;8;10616;143;to fundamentals set by Nature’s hand,;kirkpatrick
3;8;10617;144;pursuing these, you’d make a happy end.;kirkpatrick
3;8;10618;145;But you will twist to some religious role;kirkpatrick
3;8;10619;146;a man who’s born to buckle on the sword,;kirkpatrick
3;8;10620;147;and make a king of someone who should preach.;kirkpatrick
3;8;10621;148;And so your track goes wholly from the road.’;kirkpatrick
3;9;10622;1;Lovely Clemenza, your dearest Carlo –;kirkpatrick
3;9;10623;2;once having made that clear to me – went on;kirkpatrick
3;9;10624;3;to tell the treacheries his seed would face,;kirkpatrick
3;9;10625;4;but said: ‘Be silent. Let the years move by.’;kirkpatrick
3;9;10626;5;So there is nothing I can say, save this,;kirkpatrick
3;9;10627;6;that grief deservedly will follow harm.;kirkpatrick
3;9;10628;7;The heart, already, of that holy light;kirkpatrick
3;9;10629;8;had turned to meet the sun that ﬁlled it full,;kirkpatrick
3;9;10630;9;the Good that is the All of all that is.;kirkpatrick
3;9;10631;10;You self-deceiving souls! Mere things-gone-wrong!;kirkpatrick
3;9;10632;11;Twisting your hearts away from that true good,;kirkpatrick
3;9;10633;12;you strain your brows direct to nothingness.;kirkpatrick
3;9;10634;13;Look now! Another of those splendours came;kirkpatrick
3;9;10635;14;making towards me there, and signiﬁed,;kirkpatrick
3;9;10636;15;in ﬂares of brightness, it would do my will.;kirkpatrick
3;9;10637;16;The eyes of Beatrice, ﬁrm on me;kirkpatrick
3;9;10638;17;as earlier, conﬁrmed me in desire,;kirkpatrick
3;9;10639;18;giving beloved assurance as before.;kirkpatrick
3;9;10640;19;So, longingly, I said: ‘You happy soul!;kirkpatrick
3;9;10641;20;Quickly, in answer, balance what I will.;kirkpatrick
3;9;10642;21;Prove that in you I can reﬂect my thought.’;kirkpatrick
3;9;10643;22;At which the light, still new before my eyes,;kirkpatrick
3;9;10644;23;out of those depths from which it ﬁrst had sung,;kirkpatrick
3;9;10645;24;went on as though rejoicing in good deeds.;kirkpatrick
3;9;10646;25;‘In that degenerate, that evil part;kirkpatrick
3;9;10647;26;of Italy that lies between Rialto;kirkpatrick
3;9;10648;27;and the fountain-springs of Piave and Brent,;kirkpatrick
3;9;10649;28;a hill starts up – though not to any height –;kirkpatrick
3;9;10650;29;from which there once came down a burning brand;kirkpatrick
3;9;10651;30;who ravaged all the countryside around.;kirkpatrick
3;9;10652;31;From one same root, this torch and I were born.;kirkpatrick
3;9;10653;32;Cunizza was my name, and I blaze here;kirkpatrick
3;9;10654;33;because the light of Venus vanquished me.;kirkpatrick
3;9;10655;34;But gladly I myself forgive myself;kirkpatrick
3;9;10656;35;that inﬂuence. It does not brood on me –;kirkpatrick
3;9;10657;36;which will, to humdrum minds of yours, seem hard.;kirkpatrick
3;9;10658;37;Of this deep gleaming jewel that, nearest me,;kirkpatrick
3;9;10659;38;rejoices in our heavenly sky, great fame;kirkpatrick
3;9;10660;39;remains, nor will it die on earth until;kirkpatrick
3;9;10661;40;the full en-ﬁving of this hundredth year.;kirkpatrick
3;9;10662;41;You see, then? Shouldn’t men seek excellence,;kirkpatrick
3;9;10663;42;bequeathing from their ﬁrst a second life?;kirkpatrick
3;9;10664;43;The present crowd, well, they don’t think of that,;kirkpatrick
3;9;10665;44;shut up between the Adige and Tagliament,;kirkpatrick
3;9;10666;45;who even when they’re beaten don’t repent.;kirkpatrick
3;9;10667;46;But Padua, whose folk so bitterly;kirkpatrick
3;9;10668;47;resist what’s right, will see its marshes change;kirkpatrick
3;9;10669;48;as, soon, the streams that bathe Vicenza blush.;kirkpatrick
3;9;10670;49;And where the Sile and the Cagnan join,;kirkpatrick
3;9;10671;50;a lord, his head held high, struts brashly on.;kirkpatrick
3;9;10672;51;The web is stretched already for his ambush.;kirkpatrick
3;9;10673;52;Feltre will soon bewail the treacherous fault;kirkpatrick
3;9;10674;53;of its own bishop whose oﬀence stinks more;kirkpatrick
3;9;10675;54;than crimes that land you in a slimy Clink.;kirkpatrick
3;9;10676;55;The tub you’d need for Ferrarese blood;kirkpatrick
3;9;10677;56;would have to be, in size, an extra-big,;kirkpatrick
3;9;10678;57;and if you syphon it by drops, you’ll ﬂag.;kirkpatrick
3;9;10679;58;It’s all that bishop’s gift – and how polite! –;kirkpatrick
3;9;10680;59;to prove so well his Guelf allegiances.;kirkpatrick
3;9;10681;60;Such gifts will suit how people there all live.;kirkpatrick
3;9;10682;61;Above are mirrors – you will call them Thrones –;kirkpatrick
3;9;10683;62;where God, in judging all, shines back to us,;kirkpatrick
3;9;10684;63;so that my bitter words are signs of good.’;kirkpatrick
3;9;10685;64;She now fell silent, and the look she gave;kirkpatrick
3;9;10686;65;suggested that her thoughts had passed elsewhere,;kirkpatrick
3;9;10687;66;returning to the wheel where she’d been ﬁrst.;kirkpatrick
3;9;10688;67;That second happiness – of which, by now,;kirkpatrick
3;9;10689;68;I knew the price – came on, to meet my sight,;kirkpatrick
3;9;10690;69;like some ﬁne ruby that the sun’s rays pierce.;kirkpatrick
3;9;10691;70;As laughter here breeds laughter, there above;kirkpatrick
3;9;10692;71;sheer happiness shoots brilliant ﬂares. Below,;kirkpatrick
3;9;10693;72;a darkening shadow marks the saddened mind.;kirkpatrick
3;9;10694;73;‘God sees,’ I said, ‘all things, and your own sight,;kirkpatrick

3;9;10696;75;so no desire can steal away from you.;kirkpatrick
3;9;10697;76;Why, then, does not your voice (which so delights;kirkpatrick

3;9;10701;80;If I in-you-ed myself as you in-me,;kirkpatrick

3;9;10703;82;‘The greatest ocean-trench that water ﬁlls’;kirkpatrick
3;9;10704;83;– in this way he began his words to me –;kirkpatrick
3;9;10705;84;‘except that sea which garlands all dry land,;kirkpatrick
3;9;10706;85;travels so far between opposing shores,;kirkpatrick
3;9;10707;86;against the sun, that where the horizon;kirkpatrick
3;9;10708;87;at ﬁrst had been it makes its meridian.;kirkpatrick
3;9;10709;88;I dwelt once on the shores of that great lake;kirkpatrick
3;9;10710;89;between the Ebro and the Magra – whose stream;kirkpatrick
3;9;10711;90;brieﬂy divides the Genoan and Tuscan realms.;kirkpatrick
3;9;10712;91;Almost at one same point of dawn and dusk;kirkpatrick
3;9;10713;92;sit both Boughia and the place I was,;kirkpatrick
3;9;10714;93;which made its harbour warm with its own gore.;kirkpatrick
3;9;10715;94;Folco they called me, those who knew my name.;kirkpatrick
3;9;10716;95;This heaven now bears my imprint, as once I,;kirkpatrick
3;9;10717;96;on earth, beneath its inﬂuence, carried its.;kirkpatrick
3;9;10718;97;For Dido – Belus’s daughter – in her love,;kirkpatrick
3;9;10719;98;harming Creusa and Sichaeus too,;kirkpatrick
3;9;10720;99;never burned more than I when young, untonsured.;kirkpatrick
3;9;10721;100;Nor did the Rhodopeian girl, so tricked;kirkpatrick
3;9;10722;101;by her Demophoon, nor did Alcides –;kirkpatrick
3;9;10723;102;heart around Iole so closely locked.;kirkpatrick
3;9;10724;103;Yet here we don’t repent such things. We smile,;kirkpatrick
3;9;10725;104;not, though, at sin – we don’t think back to that – but at;kirkpatrick
3;9;10726;105;that Might that governs and provides.;kirkpatrick
3;9;10727;106;In wonder, we here prize the art to which;kirkpatrick
3;9;10728;107;His power brings beauty, and discern the good;kirkpatrick
3;9;10729;108;through which the world above turns all below.;kirkpatrick
3;9;10730;109;But so that you should take back satisﬁed;kirkpatrick
3;9;10731;110;the doubts this sphere has bred within your will,;kirkpatrick
3;9;10732;111;I need to make my way still further on.;kirkpatrick
3;9;10733;112;You wish to know who shines within that lamp;kirkpatrick
3;9;10734;113;here close against my side and scintillates;kirkpatrick
3;9;10735;114;as sun rays in the purest waters do.;kirkpatrick
3;9;10736;115;Then understand that Rahab in these depths;kirkpatrick
3;9;10737;116;grows bright with peace. And she, at one with us,;kirkpatrick
3;9;10738;117;has set the highest seal upon our ranks.;kirkpatrick
3;9;10739;118;She to this heaven, where earth’s shadow points,;kirkpatrick
3;9;10740;119;was lifted up before all other souls,;kirkpatrick
3;9;10741;120;drawn there by Christ in his triumphal march.;kirkpatrick
3;9;10742;121;This much was right, for Rahab to be set;kirkpatrick
3;9;10743;122;in some such heaven as a martyr’s palm,;kirkpatrick
3;9;10744;123;to mark the victory won by Christ’s two palms.;kirkpatrick
3;9;10745;124;She looked with favour on that proud assault;kirkpatrick
3;9;10746;125;of Joshua as victor in the Holy Land –;kirkpatrick
3;9;10747;126;a place that hardly stirs the papal conscience.;kirkpatrick
3;9;10748;127;That town of yours, a thriving weed that he,;kirkpatrick
3;9;10749;128;the ﬁrst of all to shun his own creator,;kirkpatrick
3;9;10750;129;has planted there (his meanness stirs complaint);kirkpatrick
3;9;10751;130;breeds and distributes that accursèd ﬂower;kirkpatrick

3;9;10754;133;The Gospels and the teachers of the Church;kirkpatrick
3;9;10755;134;are, for sheer greed, abandoned. Decretals;kirkpatrick
3;9;10756;135;(their margins show as much) are all one reads.;kirkpatrick
3;9;10757;136;The pope and cardinals are set on that.;kirkpatrick
3;9;10758;137;Their thoughts will never turn to Nazareth,;kirkpatrick
3;9;10759;138;where Gabriel once opened angel wings.;kirkpatrick
3;9;10760;139;The Vatican and other parts of Rome;kirkpatrick
3;9;10761;140;which, chosen well, have been the burial ground;kirkpatrick
3;9;10762;141;for all who followed Peter as his troop;kirkpatrick
3;9;10763;142;shall soon be free of this adultery.’;kirkpatrick
3;10;10764;1;Looking within his Son through that same Love;kirkpatrick
3;10;10765;2;that Each breathes out eternally with Each,;kirkpatrick
3;10;10766;3;the ﬁrst and three-fold Worth, beyond all words,  formed;kirkpatrick
3;10;10767;4;all that spins through intellect or space;kirkpatrick
3;10;10768;5;in such clear order it can never be,;kirkpatrick
3;10;10769;6;that we, in wonder, fail to taste Him there.;kirkpatrick
3;10;10770;7;Lift up your eyes, then, reader, and, along with;kirkpatrick
3;10;10771;8;me, look to those wheels, directed to that part;kirkpatrick
3;10;10772;9;where motions – yearly and diurnal – clash.;kirkpatrick
3;10;10773;10;And there, entranced, begin to view the skill;kirkpatrick
3;10;10774;11;the Master demonstrates. Within Himself,;kirkpatrick
3;10;10775;12;He loves it so, His looking never leaves.;kirkpatrick
3;10;10776;13;Look! Where those orbits meet, there branches oﬀ;kirkpatrick
3;10;10777;14;the slanting circles that the planets ride;kirkpatrick
3;10;10778;15;to feed and ﬁll the world that calls on them.;kirkpatrick
3;10;10779;16;And were the path it takes not twisted so,;kirkpatrick
3;10;10780;17;then many astral virtues would be wasted,;kirkpatrick
3;10;10781;18;and almost all potential, down here, dead.;kirkpatrick
3;10;10782;19;And were the distance any more or less;kirkpatrick
3;10;10783;20;from that straight course, then much – above and here –;kirkpatrick
3;10;10784;21;so ordered in the world, would be a void.;kirkpatrick
3;10;10785;22;Now, reader, sit there at your lecture bench.;kirkpatrick
3;10;10786;23;And, if you want not tedium but joy,;kirkpatrick
3;10;10787;24;continue thinking of the sip you’ve had.;kirkpatrick
3;10;10788;25;I’ve laid it out. Now feed on it yourself.;kirkpatrick
3;10;10789;26;The theme of which I’m made to be scribe;kirkpatrick
3;10;10790;27;drags in its own direction all my thoughts.;kirkpatrick
3;10;10791;28;The greatest minister of natural life;kirkpatrick
3;10;10792;29;who prints the worth of Heaven on the world,;kirkpatrick
3;10;10793;30;and measures time for us in shining light,;kirkpatrick
3;10;10794;31;conjoined with Aries (as we’ve called to mind),;kirkpatrick
3;10;10795;32;was spinning through those spirals where, each hour, its;kirkpatrick
3;10;10796;33;presence is revealed to us the sooner.;kirkpatrick
3;10;10797;34;And with him I was there, but no more knew;kirkpatrick
3;10;10798;35;of making that ascent than anyone;kirkpatrick
3;10;10799;36;will know a thought before it ﬁrst appears.;kirkpatrick
3;10;10800;37;It’s she – Beatrice – who sees the way,;kirkpatrick
3;10;10801;38;from good to better still, so suddenly;kirkpatrick
3;10;10802;39;her actions aren’t stretched out in passing time.;kirkpatrick
3;10;10803;40;How brilliant they must all, themselves, have been;kirkpatrick
3;10;10804;41;seen in the sun where I now came to be,;kirkpatrick
3;10;10805;42;not in mere hue but showing forth pure light.;kirkpatrick
3;10;10806;43;Call as I might on training, art or wit,;kirkpatrick
3;10;10807;44;no words of mine could make the image seen.;kirkpatrick
3;10;10808;45;Belief, though, may conceive it, eyes still long.;kirkpatrick
3;10;10809;46;In us, imagination is too mean;kirkpatrick
3;10;10810;47;for such great heights. And that’s no miracle.;kirkpatrick
3;10;10811;48;For no eye ever went beyond the sun.;kirkpatrick
3;10;10812;49;So shining there was that fourth family;kirkpatrick
3;10;10813;50;that’s always fed by one exalted Sire;kirkpatrick
3;10;10814;51;with sight of what He breathes, what Son He has.;kirkpatrick
3;10;10815;52;And now, ‘Give thanks,’ Beatrice began.;kirkpatrick
3;10;10816;53;‘Give thanks to the Him, the Sun of all the angels.;kirkpatrick
3;10;10817;54;In grace, He’s raised you to this sun of sense.’;kirkpatrick
3;10;10818;55;No mortal heart was ever so well fed;kirkpatrick
3;10;10819;56;to give itself devoutly to its God;kirkpatrick
3;10;10820;57;so swiftly, with such gratitude and joy,;kirkpatrick
3;10;10821;58;as now, to hear her words ring, I became.;kirkpatrick
3;10;10822;59;I set my love so wholly on that Sun;kirkpatrick
3;10;10823;60;that He, in oblivion, eclipsed even Beatrice.;kirkpatrick
3;10;10824;61;This did not trouble her. She smiled at it.;kirkpatrick
3;10;10825;62;And brightness from the laughter in her eyes;kirkpatrick
3;10;10826;63;shared out to many things my one whole mind.;kirkpatrick
3;10;10827;64;Bright beyond seeing, I saw, now, many ﬂares;kirkpatrick
3;10;10828;65;make us their centre and themselves our crown,;kirkpatrick
3;10;10829;66;still sweeter even in voice than radiance.;kirkpatrick
3;10;10830;67;Sometimes, in that same way, we see a zone;kirkpatrick
3;10;10831;68;around Latona’s daughter – lunar rays,;kirkpatrick
3;10;10832;69;held in by gravid air, which form her belt,;kirkpatrick
3;10;10833;70;There in that heavenly court from which I come;kirkpatrick
3;10;10834;71;are found so many jewels, so ﬁne, so rare,;kirkpatrick
3;10;10835;72;they cannot be abstracted from that realm.;kirkpatrick
3;10;10836;73;The singing of the lights was one of these.;kirkpatrick
3;10;10837;74;So minds who don’t, self-winged, coming ﬂying here, must;kirkpatrick
3;10;10838;75;wait to gather news from tongues struck mute.;kirkpatrick
3;10;10839;76;And when, still singing, all these burning suns;kirkpatrick
3;10;10840;77;had spun three turns around us where we were –;kirkpatrick
3;10;10841;78;as stars more swift the closer to ﬁxed poles –;kirkpatrick
3;10;10842;79;girl-like in formal dance they looked to me,;kirkpatrick
3;10;10843;80;in ﬁgure still but silent, pausing now,;kirkpatrick
3;10;10844;81;listening until they caught the next new note.;kirkpatrick
3;10;10845;82;And deep in one of these I heard begin: ‘When;kirkpatrick
3;10;10846;83;rays of grace igniting love in truth –;kirkpatrick
3;10;10847;84;those rays through which, in loving, love still grows –;kirkpatrick
3;10;10848;85;reﬂect in you so multiplied that you;kirkpatrick
3;10;10849;86;are led along with them to climb this stair,;kirkpatrick
3;10;10850;87;which none descends who will not rise again,;kirkpatrick
3;10;10851;88;whoever, seeing this, should then withhold;kirkpatrick
3;10;10852;89;the wine ﬂask that you thirst for counts as free no more;kirkpatrick
3;10;10853;90;than rain not streaming to the ocean.;kirkpatrick
3;10;10854;91;You wish to know what plants these are – enﬂowered,;kirkpatrick
3;10;10855;92;entranced – a garland round that donna who,;kirkpatrick
3;10;10856;93;in beauty, strengthens you to dare the skies.;kirkpatrick
3;10;10857;94;I was a lamb within that holy ﬂock;kirkpatrick
3;10;10858;95;that Dominic conducts along the road;kirkpatrick
3;10;10859;96;where “All grow fat who do not go astray”.;kirkpatrick
3;10;10860;97;This one, who here is nearest on my right,;kirkpatrick
3;10;10861;98;was master to me, and a brother, too –;kirkpatrick
3;10;10862;99;Albert of Köln. I’m Thomas Aquinas.;kirkpatrick
3;10;10863;100;And if you wish to know the rest as well,;kirkpatrick
3;10;10864;101;then follow with your eyes the words I speak,;kirkpatrick
3;10;10865;102;circling around this interwoven string.;kirkpatrick
3;10;10866;103;The next ﬂame blazes out from Gratian’s smile.;kirkpatrick
3;10;10867;104;He’s loved in Paradise for having served;kirkpatrick
3;10;10868;105;both civil and ecclesial courts so well.;kirkpatrick
3;10;10869;106;Then next, that Peter ornaments our choir;kirkpatrick
3;10;10870;107;who, like the widow in Saint Luke’s account,;kirkpatrick
3;10;10871;108;oﬀered his treasured all to Holy Church.;kirkpatrick
3;10;10872;109;The ﬁfth light, and the loveliest of us all,;kirkpatrick
3;10;10873;110;breathes with such love that everyone down there;kirkpatrick
3;10;10874;111;hungers to have fresh word if he is saved.;kirkpatrick
3;10;10875;112;A mind so high is there, to which was sent;kirkpatrick
3;10;10876;113;knowledge so deep that, if the truth is true,;kirkpatrick
3;10;10877;114;no second ever rose who saw so much.;kirkpatrick
3;10;10878;115;You see a candle shining by him there;kirkpatrick
3;10;10879;116;that saw, while in the ﬂesh, most inwardly;kirkpatrick
3;10;10880;117;the nature of the angels and their works.;kirkpatrick
3;10;10881;118;Then in the very smallest of these lights;kirkpatrick
3;10;10882;119;there smiles the one who spoke for Christian times.;kirkpatrick
3;10;10883;120;Augustine cited him in what he wrote.;kirkpatrick
3;10;10884;121;Now if, to track my words of praise, you draw;kirkpatrick
3;10;10885;122;the eye of intellect from light to light,;kirkpatrick
3;10;10886;123;already you’ll be thirsting for the eighth.;kirkpatrick
3;10;10887;124;Rejoicing, deep within, to see all good,;kirkpatrick
3;10;10888;125;the blessèd soul is there who made quite plain;kirkpatrick
3;10;10889;126;the world’s fallaciousness – to all who’d hear.;kirkpatrick
3;10;10890;127;The body he was driven from lies, now,;kirkpatrick
3;10;10891;128;below in Golden Heaven Church. He came;kirkpatrick
3;10;10892;129;to peace from exile, from his martyrdom.;kirkpatrick
3;10;10893;130;Burning beyond, you see the breathing ﬁres;kirkpatrick
3;10;10894;131;of Bede, then Isidore and Richard, too –;kirkpatrick
3;10;10895;132;in contemplation he was more than man.;kirkpatrick
3;10;10896;133;The one from whom your glance returns to me;kirkpatrick
3;10;10897;134;is light born of that spirit who, oppressed;kirkpatrick
3;10;10898;135;in thought, saw death, it seemed, come all too slow.;kirkpatrick
3;10;10899;136;This is the everlasting light of Siger,;kirkpatrick
3;10;10900;137;whose lectures, given in Straw Alleyway,;kirkpatrick
3;10;10901;138;argued for truths that won him envious hate.’;kirkpatrick
3;10;10902;139;And now, like clocks that call us at the hour;kirkpatrick
3;10;10903;140;in which the Bride of God will leave her bed;kirkpatrick
3;10;10904;141;to win the Bridegroom’s love with morning song,;kirkpatrick
3;10;10905;142;where, working, one part drives, the other draws –;kirkpatrick
3;10;10906;143;its ‘ting-ting’ sounding with so sweet a note;kirkpatrick
3;10;10907;144;that now the spirit, well and ready, swells –;kirkpatrick
3;10;10908;145;so in its glory I beheld that wheel;kirkpatrick
3;10;10909;146;go moving round and answer, voice to voice,;kirkpatrick
3;10;10910;147;tuned to a sweetness that cannot be known,;kirkpatrick
3;10;10911;148;except up there where joy in-evers all.;kirkpatrick
3;11;10912;1;Those idiotic strivings of the human mind!;kirkpatrick
3;11;10913;2;How ﬂawed their arguments and logic are,;kirkpatrick
3;11;10914;3;driving our wings to ﬂap in downward ﬂight.;kirkpatrick
3;11;10915;4;Some follow Law. Some drift (great tomes in hand);kirkpatrick
3;11;10916;5;to Medicine, others train in priestly craft.;kirkpatrick
3;11;10917;6;Some rule by force, as others do by tricks.;kirkpatrick
3;11;10918;7;Some choose to steal, some trade in politics,;kirkpatrick
3;11;10919;8;some toil, engrossed in pleasures of the ﬂesh,;kirkpatrick
3;11;10920;9;and others concentrate their minds on ease,;kirkpatrick
3;11;10921;10;while I, released from all that sort of thing,;kirkpatrick
3;11;10922;11;was gathered up on high with Beatrice;kirkpatrick
3;11;10923;12;in glorious triumph to the heavenly spheres.;kirkpatrick
3;11;10924;13;When each soul, dancing, had returned to that;kirkpatrick
3;11;10925;14;position on the circle where it once had been,;kirkpatrick
3;11;10926;15;all paused, like candles in a chandelier.;kirkpatrick
3;11;10927;16;And in that ﬂare which spoke to me at ﬁrst,;kirkpatrick
3;11;10928;17;I, hearing, sensed these words begin, smiling;kirkpatrick
3;11;10929;18;as in their brilliance they became more pure.;kirkpatrick
3;11;10930;19;‘As I am here a mirror to the radiance;kirkpatrick
3;11;10931;20;of everlasting light, so, looking back,;kirkpatrick
3;11;10932;21;I grasp, in that, the wherefore of your thoughts.;kirkpatrick
3;11;10933;22;You have your doubts. You want me to deﬁne –;kirkpatrick
3;11;10934;23;with sharper and more open explanations,;kirkpatrick
3;11;10935;24;directed at your human ear – the words;kirkpatrick
3;11;10936;25;I uttered earlier: “Where all grow fat…”;kirkpatrick
3;11;10937;26;and where I said: “No second ever rose.”;kirkpatrick
3;11;10938;27;We need to make distinctions as to that.;kirkpatrick
3;11;10939;28;The providence that rules the universe,;kirkpatrick
3;11;10940;29;in counsels so profound that all created;kirkpatrick
3;11;10941;30;countenance will yield before it ﬁnds its depth,;kirkpatrick
3;11;10942;31;intended that the Bride of Christ (He wooed her;kirkpatrick
3;11;10943;32;with His sacred blood, His cries raised high);kirkpatrick
3;11;10944;33;should go to her Belovèd in delight,;kirkpatrick
3;11;10945;34;sure of herself and truer still to Him,;kirkpatrick
3;11;10946;35;and so ordained two princes that, on either side,;kirkpatrick
3;11;10947;36;should walk along with her and be her guide.;kirkpatrick
3;11;10948;37;The one was seraph-like in burning love,;kirkpatrick
3;11;10949;38;the other in intelligence a splendour;kirkpatrick
3;11;10950;39;on the earth that shone like Heaven’s cherubim.;kirkpatrick
3;11;10951;40;I’ll speak of one. For – take whichever man –;kirkpatrick
3;11;10952;41;in prizing him, you’ll praise the other, too.;kirkpatrick
3;11;10953;42;Their diﬀerent actions served a single plan.;kirkpatrick
3;11;10954;43;Between the Tupin and the stream that runs;kirkpatrick
3;11;10955;44;down from the hill that saintly Ubald chose,;kirkpatrick
3;11;10956;45;a fertile slope hangs oﬀ that mountainside;kirkpatrick
3;11;10957;46;from which Perugia, through its Sun Gate, feels;kirkpatrick
3;11;10958;47;both heat and chill. Behind that ridge are, weeping,;kirkpatrick
3;11;10959;48;Nòcera and Gualdo, bowed by wind and shade.;kirkpatrick
3;11;10960;49;And where its swiftest incline crashes down,;kirkpatrick
3;11;10961;50;another sun was born to light the world –;kirkpatrick
3;11;10962;51;as our sun ranges, sometimes, from the Ganges.;kirkpatrick
3;11;10963;52;Let those, inventing words to suit that place,;kirkpatrick
3;11;10964;53;not voice “Assisi” as “Ascesi” or “Arisen”;kirkpatrick
3;11;10965;54;(these words all want) but properly the “Orient”.;kirkpatrick
3;11;10966;55;Nor was he far from his own rising dawn;kirkpatrick
3;11;10967;56;when he began to make his country feel,;kirkpatrick
3;11;10968;57;by his true powers, a certain strengthening.;kirkpatrick
3;11;10969;58;Headlong he ran – a callow boy – to war;kirkpatrick
3;11;10970;59;and fought, against his father, for a girl;kirkpatrick
3;11;10971;60;to whom – as though to death – all lock joy’s door.;kirkpatrick
3;11;10972;61;So, coram patre in the bishop’s court,;kirkpatrick
3;11;10973;62;he joined himself with her and, ever on,;kirkpatrick
3;11;10974;63;from day to day he loved her all the more.;kirkpatrick
3;11;10975;64;She, sad and widowed of her ﬁrst beloved,;kirkpatrick
3;11;10976;65;remained a thousand years (and more) till he;kirkpatrick
3;11;10977;66;came on to her – obscure, undated, scorned.;kirkpatrick
3;11;10978;67;Nor did it count to hear how Caesar – terror;kirkpatrick
3;11;10979;68;of the world – had found her true, unwavering,;kirkpatrick
3;11;10980;69;with Amyclas, not moved by his command.;kirkpatrick
3;11;10981;70;Nor did it count to hear that, likewise, she,;kirkpatrick
3;11;10982;71;so ﬁerce, so constant, wept (Mary herself;kirkpatrick
3;11;10983;72;remained below) with Christ upon his Cross.;kirkpatrick
3;11;10984;73;But lest in what I say I prove unclear,;kirkpatrick
3;11;10985;74;then understand, in all I’ve just poured out,;kirkpatrick
3;11;10986;75;this loving pair are Francis and pure Poverty.;kirkpatrick
3;11;10987;76;The harmony, the looks of happiness;kirkpatrick
3;11;10988;77;between these two, their tenderness and care,;kirkpatrick
3;11;10989;78;their love, so wonderstruck, became the cause;kirkpatrick
3;11;10990;79;of holy thoughts in Bernard (now revered),;kirkpatrick
3;11;10991;80;the ﬁrst who ﬂung his shoes away and raced –;kirkpatrick
3;11;10992;81;running, he thought himself too slow – for peace.;kirkpatrick
3;11;10993;82;Such rampant goodness, riches yet untold!;kirkpatrick
3;11;10994;83;Egidio ﬂung his shoes away, Sylvester his,;kirkpatrick
3;11;10995;84;chasing the groom, the bride so pleased them all.;kirkpatrick
3;11;10996;85;So oﬀ he goes, Saint Francis, father, lord.;kirkpatrick
3;11;10997;86;His bride was Poverty, his family these –;kirkpatrick
3;11;10998;87;their waists already bound with simple cord.;kirkpatrick
3;11;10999;88;Nor in abjection did it weigh his brows;kirkpatrick
3;11;11000;89;to be Pietro Bernadone’s kid,;kirkpatrick
3;11;11001;90;nor when, amazingly, he faced disdain.;kirkpatrick
3;11;11002;91;Rather, in sovereign manner he revealed;kirkpatrick
3;11;11003;92;his stern intention to Pope Innocent,;kirkpatrick
3;11;11004;93;who granted this devotion its ﬁrst seal.;kirkpatrick
3;11;11005;94;And when his little pauper-company;kirkpatrick
3;11;11006;95;had grown (the wonder of his life would sound;kirkpatrick
3;11;11007;96;far more when sung in glory in the skies),;kirkpatrick
3;11;11008;97;this archimandrite in his holy will;kirkpatrick
3;11;11009;98;was crowned now with a second diadem,;kirkpatrick
3;11;11010;99;breathed by Eternal Spirit through Honorius.;kirkpatrick
3;11;11011;100;Then after, thirsting for a martyr’s fate,;kirkpatrick
3;11;11012;101;he preached (before the Sultan’s prideful throne);kirkpatrick
3;11;11013;102;his faith in Christ and all who followed him,;kirkpatrick
3;11;11014;103;but found these people loath and far too sour;kirkpatrick
3;11;11015;104;to change their ways. So, not to wait in vain,;kirkpatrick
3;11;11016;105;he soon returned, to tend Italian vines.;kirkpatrick
3;11;11017;106;A rough crag splits the Arno’s course from Tiber.;kirkpatrick
3;11;11018;107;There Francis took from Christ the ﬁnal seal,;kirkpatrick
3;11;11019;108;and on his limbs for two years bore that sign.;kirkpatrick
3;11;11020;109;And when the one who’d dealt him so much good;kirkpatrick
3;11;11021;110;was pleased to draw him up to that reward;kirkpatrick
3;11;11022;111;which Francis earned through his great lowliness,;kirkpatrick
3;11;11023;112;he then bestowed his donna , held so dear,;kirkpatrick
3;11;11024;113;on followers and brothers, his true heirs,;kirkpatrick
3;11;11025;114;commanding them, in faith, to love her well.;kirkpatrick
3;11;11026;115;And from her bosom this illustrious soul;kirkpatrick
3;11;11027;116;then chose to part, returning to his realm,;kirkpatrick
3;11;11028;117;and chose no other bier for his own corpse.;kirkpatrick
3;11;11029;118;Think of the other now, what he was like;kirkpatrick
3;11;11030;119;if ﬁt to work with Francis and maintain;kirkpatrick
3;11;11031;120;the Ship of Peter on its rightful track.;kirkpatrick
3;11;11032;121;Such was our patriarch, Saint Dominic.;kirkpatrick
3;11;11033;122;And those who follow him as he commands;kirkpatrick
3;11;11034;123;will bear, as you can tell, a precious freight.;kirkpatrick
3;11;11035;124;But now this pastor’s ﬂock turns ravenous;kirkpatrick
3;11;11036;125;for weird new fodder, so they cannot fail;kirkpatrick
3;11;11037;126;to scatter wide through many diﬀerent leas.;kirkpatrick
3;11;11038;127;The further – wilful, wandering and wild –;kirkpatrick
3;11;11039;128;his sheep desert him, so the emptier;kirkpatrick
3;11;11040;129;they are of milk, returning to the fold.;kirkpatrick
3;11;11041;130;It’s true that some are fearful of such harm,;kirkpatrick
3;11;11042;131;huddling against their shepherd still. They’re few.;kirkpatrick
3;11;11043;132;There’s not much cloth now needed for their cowls.;kirkpatrick
3;11;11044;133;Now if my words in meaning aren’t too faint,;kirkpatrick
3;11;11045;134;if you have been attentive, hearing them,;kirkpatrick
3;11;11046;135;if you call what’s been said to mind once more,;kirkpatrick
3;11;11047;136;in part what you desire will be content.;kirkpatrick
3;11;11048;137;You’ll see why that ﬁrm plant is torn to shreds,;kirkpatrick
3;11;11049;138;and see the strict correction that contends:;kirkpatrick
3;11;11050;139;“Where all grow fat that do not go astray.” ‘;kirkpatrick
3;12;11051;1;The moment that this consecrated ﬂame;kirkpatrick
3;12;11052;2;had plucked the string to sound its ﬁnal word,;kirkpatrick
3;12;11053;3;the holy grinding stone began to wheel.;kirkpatrick
3;12;11054;4;Nor had it gone a whole rotation through;kirkpatrick
3;12;11055;5;before a second circle closed around,;kirkpatrick
3;12;11056;6;and coupled move to move and song with song –;kirkpatrick
3;12;11057;7;songs that defeat, in gentle trumpet calls,;kirkpatrick
3;12;11058;8;our muses and all siren-songs as much;kirkpatrick
3;12;11059;9;as primal splendour does its mirrored light.;kirkpatrick
3;12;11060;10;Compare: when haughty Juno bids her maid,;kirkpatrick
3;12;11061;11;then double rainbows arch through ﬁne-spun cloud,;kirkpatrick
3;12;11062;12;concentric and the same in all their hues,;kirkpatrick
3;12;11063;13;the inner brings the outer into life;kirkpatrick
3;12;11064;14;(as, too, the words, astray, entranced, of Echo, whom love;kirkpatrick
3;12;11065;15;dispersed as sun consumes the mist);kirkpatrick
3;12;11066;16;and these arcs show, for people here on earth,;kirkpatrick
3;12;11067;17;as tokens of the pact God made with Noah;kirkpatrick
3;12;11068;18;the world would never suﬀer ﬂood again.;kirkpatrick
3;12;11069;19;So, too, these swirls of sempiternal rose;kirkpatrick
3;12;11070;20;circled around us in their double band.;kirkpatrick
3;12;11071;21;So too the outer answered that within.;kirkpatrick
3;12;11072;22;When once their galliard – their festal joy,;kirkpatrick
3;12;11073;23;their singing and their ﬂame-darts each to each, light;kirkpatrick
3;12;11074;24;meeting light, wooing and rejoicing –  all at one point,;kirkpatrick
3;12;11075;25;together in one will,;kirkpatrick
3;12;11076;26;at last were quieted (as eyelids, too,;kirkpatrick
3;12;11077;27;both moved by one delight, are closed and raised)  then;kirkpatrick
3;12;11078;28;from the heart of one of these new lights;kirkpatrick
3;12;11079;29;there moved a voice which made me turn to there, it;kirkpatrick
3;12;11080;30;seemed, as needle to magnetic star.;kirkpatrick
3;12;11081;31;‘The love that makes me lovely,’ this began,;kirkpatrick
3;12;11082;32;‘draws me to speak about that other lord;kirkpatrick
3;12;11083;33;whose aide has spoken here so well of mine.;kirkpatrick
3;12;11084;34;It’s right, where one is, that we name his peer,;kirkpatrick
3;12;11085;35;for these two soldiered to a single end;kirkpatrick
3;12;11086;36;and so their glorious triumphs shine as one.;kirkpatrick
3;12;11087;37;Christ’s ﬁghting force (so costly to re-arm);kirkpatrick
3;12;11088;38;was marching on beneath its battle sign,;kirkpatrick
3;12;11089;39;but slow and watchful now, and much worn down.;kirkpatrick
3;12;11090;40;But then that Emperor who will always reign,;kirkpatrick
3;12;11091;41;through grace alone and not through their desert,;kirkpatrick
3;12;11092;42;provided for His soldiers, so perhaps-ed.;kirkpatrick
3;12;11093;43;He raced to aid His bride (as said before);kirkpatrick
3;12;11094;44;with two great heroes by whose words and deed;kirkpatrick
3;12;11095;45;the people who had strayed came running back.;kirkpatrick
3;12;11096;46;Westward, in regions where mild Zephyrs rise –;kirkpatrick
3;12;11097;47;to open out the fresh new foliage;kirkpatrick
3;12;11098;48;with which all Europe sees itself reclothed –;kirkpatrick
3;12;11099;49;not far from where those breaking waves resound;kirkpatrick
3;12;11100;50;beyond which, when the time comes round, the sun, its;kirkpatrick
3;12;11101;51;long course over, sinks and hides from men,;kirkpatrick
3;12;11102;52;there stands, so blessed by fortune, Calaruega;kirkpatrick
3;12;11103;53;protected by that great Castilian shield;kirkpatrick
3;12;11104;54;which, quartered, bears the lion, high and low.;kirkpatrick
3;12;11105;55;And here, impassioned by the Christian faith,;kirkpatrick
3;12;11106;56;the love-sick knight was born, a champion,;kirkpatrick
3;12;11107;57;kind to his own, but harsh to enemies.;kirkpatrick
3;12;11108;58;And mind in him no sooner took on form;kirkpatrick
3;12;11109;59;than mind was ﬁlled so full of living strength;kirkpatrick
3;12;11110;60;he made, while still enwombed, his mother prophesy.;kirkpatrick
3;12;11111;61;Then wedded, at the well of baptism,;kirkpatrick
3;12;11112;62;to Faith (where Faith and he, as marriage gift,;kirkpatrick
3;12;11113;63;each vowed salvation mutually to each),;kirkpatrick
3;12;11114;64;the lady speaking as his sponsor there;kirkpatrick
3;12;11115;65;saw in a dream the fruit to wonder at;kirkpatrick
3;12;11116;66;that he and his inheritors would bear.;kirkpatrick
3;12;11117;67;And so that all he was might show in words,;kirkpatrick
3;12;11118;68;a spirit moved from Heaven to form his name –;kirkpatrick
3;12;11119;69;the adjective of whose he wholly was.;kirkpatrick
3;12;11120;70;They called him Dominic. I speak of him;kirkpatrick
3;12;11121;71;as farmer – called and singled out by Christ,;kirkpatrick
3;12;11122;72;to work His orchard and to help it thrive.;kirkpatrick
3;12;11123;73;He seemed one sent, in truth, to follow Christ.;kirkpatrick
3;12;11124;74;The ﬁrst love that was manifest in him;kirkpatrick
3;12;11125;75;obeyed the ﬁrst command that came from Christ.;kirkpatrick
3;12;11126;76;And many times his nurse discovered him,;kirkpatrick
3;12;11127;77;awake, unspeaking, stretched out on the ground,;kirkpatrick
3;12;11128;78;as though he meant to say: “For this I came.”;kirkpatrick
3;12;11129;79;Felix, O truly happy, his father!;kirkpatrick
3;12;11130;80;O truly blessed, his mother Giovanna –;kirkpatrick
3;12;11131;81;her name in Hebrew, rightly read, means “grace”.;kirkpatrick
3;12;11132;82;Not craving worldly wealth (like those who ape;kirkpatrick
3;12;11133;83;the Ostian lawyer or a Doctor Tad);kirkpatrick
3;12;11134;84;but loving, purely, manna of God’s truth,;kirkpatrick
3;12;11135;85;he soon became a scholar of great worth,;kirkpatrick
3;12;11136;86;and hence determined to patrol those vines;kirkpatrick
3;12;11137;87;that white-rot strikes when growers are no good.;kirkpatrick
3;12;11138;88;Before the papal throne – more generous once;kirkpatrick
3;12;11139;89;(not now) to poor, true hearts, grown so diseased through;kirkpatrick
3;12;11140;90;his fault reigning now, and not its own –  he sought no;kirkpatrick
3;12;11141;91;leave to pay mere halfs and thirds,;kirkpatrick
3;12;11142;92;no ﬁrst shot at some well-paid vacancy,;kirkpatrick
3;12;11143;93;no tax rebated quae sunt pauperes ,;kirkpatrick
3;12;11144;94;rather, against a world of wilful lies,;kirkpatrick
3;12;11145;95;licence to battle for the seed of truth,;kirkpatrick
3;12;11146;96;whose saplings – twenty-four – here bind you round.;kirkpatrick
3;12;11147;97;And then he moved with learning and with zeal,;kirkpatrick
3;12;11148;98;as also with his mandate from the pope,;kirkpatrick
3;12;11149;99;like some ﬁerce torrent surging down a hill.;kirkpatrick
3;12;11150;100;And at the thicket of the heretics;kirkpatrick
3;12;11151;101;he struck with all his impetus,;kirkpatrick
3;12;11152;102;the stronger where resistance was the worse.;kirkpatrick
3;12;11153;103;Then many streams were formed within his wake;kirkpatrick
3;12;11154;104;to irrigate the orchard of the Church;kirkpatrick
3;12;11155;105;and keep the shrubs there growing better still.;kirkpatrick
3;12;11156;106;Take this to be the chariot’s second wheel,;kirkpatrick
3;12;11157;107;mounted by Holy Church, in self-defence;kirkpatrick
3;12;11158;108;to drive all civil nuisance from the ﬁeld.;kirkpatrick
3;12;11159;109;And then you’ll see laid plain before your eyes;kirkpatrick
3;12;11160;110;how excellent the other is – to whom,;kirkpatrick
3;12;11161;111;before I came, Saint Thomas was so courteous.;kirkpatrick
3;12;11162;112;The track, however, that the wheel-tread leaves;kirkpatrick
3;12;11163;113;has gone all wrong at its circumference.;kirkpatrick
3;12;11164;114;Where once the wine-crust crisped, it’s musty now.;kirkpatrick
3;12;11165;115;His retinue – which once, in his own prints,;kirkpatrick
3;12;11166;116;trod straight and true – has done a turn-about.;kirkpatrick
3;12;11167;117;So toes now spring where once the heels had been.;kirkpatrick
3;12;11168;118;And soon we’ll see what crops bad farming yields,;kirkpatrick
3;12;11169;119;when tares and weeds, complaining, will all whine, being;kirkpatrick
3;12;11170;120;denied safe storage in the barn.;kirkpatrick
3;12;11171;121;Granted, whoever browsed through, page by page,;kirkpatrick
3;12;11172;122;our master-roll would ﬁnd there still and read: “I in myself;kirkpatrick
3;12;11173;123;am what I always was.”;kirkpatrick
3;12;11174;124;But not the Acquaspartan or the Casalese.;kirkpatrick
3;12;11175;125;For these are such as either ﬂee, or take;kirkpatrick
3;12;11176;126;too strictly, text and rule ad litteram.;kirkpatrick
3;12;11177;127;I am the living heart of Bonaventure –;kirkpatrick
3;12;11178;128;Bagnoregensian. In public works;kirkpatrick
3;12;11179;129;I set aside all underhand concerns.;kirkpatrick
3;12;11180;130;The ﬁrst who joined our barefoot band, and twined;kirkpatrick
3;12;11181;131;the cord, as friends to God, around their waists, are here –;kirkpatrick
3;12;11182;132;Illuminato, Agostino, too.;kirkpatrick
3;12;11183;133;Along with them is Hugo of Saint Victor,;kirkpatrick
3;12;11184;134;Peter of Spain – who glitters there below;kirkpatrick
3;12;11185;135;in twelve ﬁne tomes – and Peter Mangiador,;kirkpatrick
3;12;11186;136;Nathan the Seer, the Bishop Metropolitan;kirkpatrick
3;12;11187;137;Chrysostom, Anselm and Donatus next,;kirkpatrick
3;12;11188;138;who set his hand to write the grammar rules.;kirkpatrick
3;12;11189;139;Raban is here and, shining by my side,;kirkpatrick
3;12;11190;140;Dom Joachim, Calabrian by birth,;kirkpatrick
3;12;11191;141;endowed with all his gifts of prophecy.;kirkpatrick
3;12;11192;142;To praise (and envy!) of Count Dominic;kirkpatrick
3;12;11193;143;I’m moved by that same burning courtesy;kirkpatrick
3;12;11194;144;of Brother Thomas and his well-judged words,;kirkpatrick
3;12;11195;145;which moved this company along with me.’;kirkpatrick
3;13;11196;1;Imagine, if you truly want to know;kirkpatrick
3;13;11197;2;what I saw now – and while I’m speaking grip;kirkpatrick
3;13;11198;3;this image ﬁrm, as though a steady rock –;kirkpatrick
3;13;11199;4;some ﬁfteen stars, from various demesnes,;kirkpatrick
3;13;11200;5;that bring the heavens to life with light so clear;kirkpatrick
3;13;11201;6;they overcome the thickest weave of air.;kirkpatrick
3;13;11202;7;Imagine, too, the Wain which needs, by day or night,;kirkpatrick
3;13;11203;8;no arc more ample than our lap of sky –;kirkpatrick
3;13;11204;9;its turning plough shaft never lost to view.;kirkpatrick
3;13;11205;10;Imagine, too, the bell mouth of the Horn,;kirkpatrick
3;13;11206;11;its point beginning at the axle end;kirkpatrick
3;13;11207;12;round which the wheel that starts the cosmos rolls.;kirkpatrick
3;13;11208;13;Imagine these all forming, in the sky,;kirkpatrick
3;13;11209;14;two signs among themselves (as when the child;kirkpatrick
3;13;11210;15;of Minos, Ariadne, felt death’s chill);kirkpatrick
3;13;11211;16;so that the rays of one contained the next;kirkpatrick
3;13;11212;17;and each was now revolving diﬀerently,;kirkpatrick
3;13;11213;18;one set in this direction, one in that,;kirkpatrick
3;13;11214;19;you’ll have a shade, then, almost, of that true;kirkpatrick
3;13;11215;20;constellation – the dance that, doubled there,;kirkpatrick
3;13;11216;21;circled around the point where I was now.;kirkpatrick
3;13;11217;22;That goes as far beyond the norms we know;kirkpatrick
3;13;11218;23;as does that sphere which outruns all the rest;kirkpatrick
3;13;11219;24;beyond the sluggish current of Chiana.;kirkpatrick
3;13;11220;25;Those songs there praised not Bacchus nor Peana.;kirkpatrick
3;13;11221;26;They sang three persons all divine in kind,;kirkpatrick
3;13;11222;27;and in one person human and divine.;kirkpatrick
3;13;11223;28;The singing done, the measured round complete,;kirkpatrick
3;13;11224;29;these holy lights stretched out their thought to us,;kirkpatrick
3;13;11225;30;rejoicing in themselves at this new care.;kirkpatrick
3;13;11226;31;The silence, then, of these concordant powers;kirkpatrick
3;13;11227;32;was broken by that light in whom I’d heard;kirkpatrick
3;13;11228;33;the story told of God’s dear down-and-out.;kirkpatrick
3;13;11229;34;‘When once,’ he said, ‘one crop of straw is threshed,;kirkpatrick
3;13;11230;35;and once the grain from that is gathered in,;kirkpatrick
3;13;11231;36;then love calls gently that I ﬂail the next.;kirkpatrick
3;13;11232;37;Your view is this, that, ﬁrstly, in that breast;kirkpatrick
3;13;11233;38;from which a living rib was drawn to make;kirkpatrick
3;13;11234;39;Eve’s lovely cheek (her taste once cost us all),;kirkpatrick
3;13;11235;40;and then in Him – His side pierced by the lance –;kirkpatrick
3;13;11236;41;who paid full satisfaction, ﬁrst and last,;kirkpatrick
3;13;11237;42;and so outweighed the scales of guilt and sin,;kirkpatrick
3;13;11238;43;were poured infusions of the greatest light;kirkpatrick
3;13;11239;44;that we in human nature rightly have,;kirkpatrick
3;13;11240;45;drawn from that Worth that ﬁrst made these two men.;kirkpatrick
3;13;11241;46;Thinking all this, you wonder at my tale;kirkpatrick
3;13;11242;47;when I declare: “No second ever rose”;kirkpatrick
3;13;11243;48;to match the good enclosed in that ﬁfth light.;kirkpatrick
3;13;11244;49;Now clear your eyes to what my answer is.;kirkpatrick
3;13;11245;50;Then what you think and what I say, agree,;kirkpatrick
3;13;11246;51;you’ll ﬁnd, in truth, as circles round one point.;kirkpatrick
3;13;11247;52;Those things that cannot die and those that can;kirkpatrick
3;13;11248;53;are nothing save the splendours of the One;kirkpatrick
3;13;11249;54;Idea that, loving, brought our Lord to birth.;kirkpatrick
3;13;11250;55;For Living Light, which, from the Fount of Light,;kirkpatrick
3;13;11251;56;cascades in ways that do not disunite it,;kirkpatrick
3;13;11252;57;from Him or from the Love en-three-ing them,;kirkpatrick
3;13;11253;58;in generosity collects its rays,;kirkpatrick
3;13;11254;59;as mirrored in nine ranks of life anew,;kirkpatrick
3;13;11255;60;itself eternally remaining One.;kirkpatrick
3;13;11256;61;Down to the outermost of what can be,;kirkpatrick
3;13;11257;62;from act to act descending, it becomes;kirkpatrick
3;13;11258;63;maker of, merely, brief contingencies.;kirkpatrick
3;13;11259;64;And, here, by “brief contingencies” I mean;kirkpatrick
3;13;11260;65;those things produced – in seed or mineral –;kirkpatrick
3;13;11261;66;by generative inﬂuence of moving spheres.;kirkpatrick
3;13;11262;67;The wax of these – as, too, the hand that guides –;kirkpatrick
3;13;11263;68;is never steady in some single mode,;kirkpatrick
3;13;11264;69;but gleams, here more, here less, beneath the ideal sign.;kirkpatrick
3;13;11265;70;It happens, therefore, that the self-same wood;kirkpatrick
3;13;11266;71;bears, in its species, better fruit or worse.;kirkpatrick
3;13;11267;72;So humans, too, are born with diﬀerent gifts.;kirkpatrick
3;13;11268;73;And were that wax point-perfectly embossed,;kirkpatrick
3;13;11269;74;and were the heavens at the height of power,;kirkpatrick
3;13;11270;75;the light of that ﬁrst seal would show in full.;kirkpatrick
3;13;11271;76;Yet Nature, as created, falls far short.;kirkpatrick
3;13;11272;77;It operates as any craftsman will;kirkpatrick
3;13;11273;78;who knows his trade and yet has trembling hands.;kirkpatrick
3;13;11274;79;If Love, though, in its fervent warmth arrays;kirkpatrick
3;13;11275;80;and prints the clear regard of Primal power,;kirkpatrick
3;13;11276;81;entire perfection will be here acquired.;kirkpatrick
3;13;11277;82;The earth was once made worthy in this way;kirkpatrick
3;13;11278;83;of all that creatures perfectly may be.;kirkpatrick
3;13;11279;84;So, too, the Virgin was made big with child.;kirkpatrick
3;13;11280;85;I do, therefore, commend the view you take,;kirkpatrick
3;13;11281;86;that human nature never was before,;kirkpatrick
3;13;11282;87;nor was to be, as, once, in these two men.;kirkpatrick
3;13;11283;88;But now suppose I did not follow on,;kirkpatrick
3;13;11284;89;“How is it, then, that he can have no peer?”;kirkpatrick
3;13;11285;90;these are the words that you’d begin to speak.;kirkpatrick
3;13;11286;91;And yet to clarify what is not clear,;kirkpatrick
3;13;11287;92;think who this was, and what – when “Ask!” was said –;kirkpatrick
3;13;11288;93;moved him, in prayer, to ask as he then did.;kirkpatrick
3;13;11289;94;My words have not been such that you can’t see;kirkpatrick
3;13;11290;95;this man was once a king who simply asked;kirkpatrick
3;13;11291;96;for wisdom to fulﬁl his kingly role,;kirkpatrick
3;13;11292;97;and not to know how many astral drives;kirkpatrick
3;13;11293;98;there are up there or whether, logically,;kirkpatrick
3;13;11294;99;necesse and contingents prove necesse ,;kirkpatrick
3;13;11295;100;or si est dare primum motum esse;kirkpatrick
3;13;11296;101;or if half-circles can contain a shape;kirkpatrick
3;13;11297;102;that is a triangle but not a “right” .;kirkpatrick
3;13;11298;103;It follows, if you note all I have said,;kirkpatrick
3;13;11299;104;that what I meant my arrow-shot to strike;kirkpatrick
3;13;11300;105;is kingly wisdom, matchless mode of sight.;kirkpatrick
3;13;11301;106;And if you look, clear-eyed, on that word “rose”,;kirkpatrick
3;13;11302;107;you’ll see the phrase applies to kings alone –;kirkpatrick
3;13;11303;108;so many, yet so few who’re any good.;kirkpatrick
3;13;11304;109;So, hearing what I say, make that distinction,;kirkpatrick
3;13;11305;110;and all will stand at one with what you hold,;kirkpatrick
3;13;11306;111;as to our father Adam and our best Beloved.;kirkpatrick
3;13;11307;112;And let this be a lead weight on your feet,;kirkpatrick
3;13;11308;113;so that you move as slow as if worn out;kirkpatrick
3;13;11309;114;to any “yes” or “no” unclear to you.;kirkpatrick
3;13;11310;115;For no fool is as low a fool as one;kirkpatrick
3;13;11311;116;who taking either of these steps will fail;kirkpatrick
3;13;11312;117;aﬃrming or denying in distinction.;kirkpatrick
3;13;11313;118;So often when our judgement rushes on,;kirkpatrick
3;13;11314;119;it happens that we veer in false directions;kirkpatrick
3;13;11315;120;and then emotions bind the intellect.;kirkpatrick
3;13;11316;121;In ﬁshing for the truth without that skill,;kirkpatrick
3;13;11317;122;it’s worse than useless to cast oﬀ from shore.;kirkpatrick
3;13;11318;123;You’ll not return the same as you set out.;kirkpatrick
3;13;11319;124;And patent proof of this throughout the world;kirkpatrick
3;13;11320;125;are Bryson and Parmenides, Melissus and all,;kirkpatrick
3;13;11321;126;who went their way not knowing where they went,;kirkpatrick
3;13;11322;127;as Arius did, Sabellius, too, and all those fools;kirkpatrick
3;13;11323;128;whose heresies have gashed the Holy Word,;kirkpatrick
3;13;11324;129;returning from its rightful gaze sheer wrong.;kirkpatrick
3;13;11325;130;And then again, don’t let folk be too sure;kirkpatrick
3;13;11326;131;in passing judgement as do those who price;kirkpatrick
3;13;11327;132;the harvest in the ﬁeld before it’s ripe.;kirkpatrick
3;13;11328;133;For I have seen, at ﬁrst, all winter through;kirkpatrick
3;13;11329;134;a thorn bush shows itself as stark and ﬁerce,;kirkpatrick
3;13;11330;135;which after bears a rose upon its height.;kirkpatrick
3;13;11331;136;And I have seen a keel, steered swift and well,;kirkpatrick
3;13;11332;137;speed over oceans all its voyage through,;kirkpatrick
3;13;11333;138;then perish at the entrance to the dock.;kirkpatrick
3;13;11334;139;And so when Mrs Smith and Mr Jones;kirkpatrick
3;13;11335;140;see one man steal, another oﬀer alms,;kirkpatrick
3;13;11336;141;don’t let them think they see this in God’s plan.;kirkpatrick
3;13;11337;142;The thief may rise, the other take a fall.’;kirkpatrick
3;14;11338;1;Centre to circle or circle to centre:;kirkpatrick
3;14;11339;2;water in a round container moves like that,;kirkpatrick
3;14;11340;3;depending where the rim is struck, inside or out.;kirkpatrick
3;14;11341;4;I utter here the instant thought that chanced;kirkpatrick
3;14;11342;5;across my mind when now, in all its glory,;kirkpatrick
3;14;11343;6;the life of Thomas Aquinas fell silent,;kirkpatrick
3;14;11344;7;born from resemblances that now arose;kirkpatrick
3;14;11345;8;between his words and these that, after him,;kirkpatrick
3;14;11346;9;were voiced by Beatrice. She began:;kirkpatrick
3;14;11347;10;‘This man still needs – although he does not say,;kirkpatrick
3;14;11348;11;nor is he even thinking it as yet –;kirkpatrick
3;14;11349;12;to trace another truth down to its root.;kirkpatrick
3;14;11350;13;Tell him: that light in which, as what you are,;kirkpatrick
3;14;11351;14;your being in its substance is in-ﬂowered,;kirkpatrick
3;14;11352;15;will that remain eternally with you?;kirkpatrick
3;14;11353;16;And if it does remain, then tell him how,;kirkpatrick
3;14;11354;17;when once you are remade as visibles,;kirkpatrick
3;14;11355;18;it cannot spoil your eyesight, being so.’;kirkpatrick
3;14;11356;19;Compare: as dancers – wheeling, drawn and pressed;kirkpatrick
3;14;11357;20;by keener happiness at certain points –;kirkpatrick
3;14;11358;21;exult in voice, their gestures quickening,;kirkpatrick
3;14;11359;22;so now, to hear her prompt, devoted prayer,;kirkpatrick
3;14;11360;23;the holy circles showed new joy, in turns;kirkpatrick
3;14;11361;24;of ﬂashing speed and notes to wonder at.;kirkpatrick
3;14;11362;25;Whoever mourns to think we here must die,;kirkpatrick
3;14;11363;26;to live our lives up there, has never seen;kirkpatrick
3;14;11364;27;the cool refreshment of the eternal shower.;kirkpatrick
3;14;11365;28;The one and two and three who always lives;kirkpatrick
3;14;11366;29;and always reign in three and two and one,;kirkpatrick
3;14;11367;30;uncircumscribed and circumscribing all,;kirkpatrick
3;14;11368;31;had, three times now, been lauded in the songs;kirkpatrick
3;14;11369;32;of every spirit there, the melody;kirkpatrick
3;14;11370;33;a condign prize, however great the worth.;kirkpatrick
3;14;11371;34;Then, in the holiest of lights among;kirkpatrick
3;14;11372;35;the lesser ring, I heard a voice (as modest;kirkpatrick
3;14;11373;36;as the angel’s, maybe, to Maria was),;kirkpatrick
3;14;11374;37;answering: ‘As long as this great festival;kirkpatrick
3;14;11375;38;of Paradise goes on, so, too, our love;kirkpatrick
3;14;11376;39;will cast these robes in rays around us all.;kirkpatrick
3;14;11377;40;That brightness follows from their inward ﬁre,;kirkpatrick
3;14;11378;41;that ﬁre from vision. And their sight extends;kirkpatrick
3;14;11379;42;as far as each, beyond their due, has grace.;kirkpatrick
3;14;11380;43;But when the glorious and sacred ﬂesh;kirkpatrick
3;14;11381;44;is clothing us once more, our person then;kirkpatrick
3;14;11382;45;will be – complete and whole – more pleasing still.;kirkpatrick
3;14;11383;46;For then whatever has been granted us,;kirkpatrick
3;14;11384;47;by utmost good, of free and gracious light;kirkpatrick
3;14;11385;48;(the light through which we see Him) will increase.;kirkpatrick
3;14;11386;49;Hence, as must be, our seeing will increase,;kirkpatrick
3;14;11387;50;increasing, too, the ﬁre that vision lights,;kirkpatrick
3;14;11388;51;the ray increasing that proceeds from that.;kirkpatrick
3;14;11389;52;But just as burning coal may give out ﬂames,;kirkpatrick
3;14;11390;53;yet overcome these with its own white light,;kirkpatrick
3;14;11391;54;keeping, within, its shape and semblance whole,  so,;kirkpatrick
3;14;11392;55;too, the shining-out that rings us round;kirkpatrick
3;14;11393;56;will, in appearance, be surpassed by ﬂesh;kirkpatrick
3;14;11394;57;which all day long the earth now covers up.;kirkpatrick
3;14;11395;58;Nor can it be that so much light will tire.;kirkpatrick
3;14;11396;59;Our organs, physically, will have the strength;kirkpatrick
3;14;11397;60;for every pleasure that can come to us.’;kirkpatrick
3;14;11398;61;So ready and alert they seemed to me –;kirkpatrick
3;14;11399;62;those double choirs – to add their plain ‘Amen’;kirkpatrick
3;14;11400;63;they showed their keen desire for long dead bones,  not;kirkpatrick
3;14;11401;64;only for themselves but for their mums,;kirkpatrick
3;14;11402;65;their fathers, too, and others dear to them,;kirkpatrick
3;14;11403;66;before they were these sempiternal ﬂames.;kirkpatrick
3;14;11404;67;Look! Round those circles, matched in clarity,;kirkpatrick
3;14;11405;68;a lustre, more than what was there, was born,;kirkpatrick
3;14;11406;69;as though a new horizon, brightening.;kirkpatrick
3;14;11407;70;When early evening hours are drawing in,;kirkpatrick
3;14;11408;71;new things begin to show across the sky;kirkpatrick
3;14;11409;72;so that the sight both seems and seems not true.;kirkpatrick
3;14;11410;73;There, too, it seemed to me that newer things;kirkpatrick
3;14;11411;74;began to rise to view and form a ring;kirkpatrick
3;14;11412;75;beyond the circumscription of those two.;kirkpatrick
3;14;11413;76;True spark shower ﬂying from the Holy Breath!;kirkpatrick
3;14;11414;77;How suddenly it ﬂared, how incandescent!;kirkpatrick
3;14;11415;78;My eyes, defeated, could not bear the sight.;kirkpatrick
3;14;11416;79;But Beatrice showed herself to me –;kirkpatrick
3;14;11417;80;laughing, so beautiful she must be left;kirkpatrick
3;14;11418;81;among things seen that memory can’t pursue.;kirkpatrick
3;14;11419;82;And so my eyes, regaining their right strength,;kirkpatrick
3;14;11420;83;lifted once more. I saw myself alone,;kirkpatrick
3;14;11421;84;borne with my lady to a higher good.;kirkpatrick
3;14;11422;85;Seeing the ﬂares of laughter in that star,;kirkpatrick
3;14;11423;86;which seemed now far more ﬁery than before,;kirkpatrick
3;14;11424;87;I knew full well that I’d been lifted higher.;kirkpatrick
3;14;11425;88;With all my heart and with that tongue – ﬂaming;kirkpatrick
3;14;11426;89;alike in all our thoughts – aﬂame, I made to God burnt;kirkpatrick
3;14;11427;90;oﬀerings that ﬁtted this new grace.;kirkpatrick
3;14;11428;91;Nor had the ardour of that sacriﬁce;kirkpatrick
3;14;11429;92;been drained still from my heart before it was, I knew,;kirkpatrick
3;14;11430;93;propitious and acceptable.;kirkpatrick
3;14;11431;94;For shining so – a ruby in its hue –;kirkpatrick
3;14;11432;95;splendour appeared to me in two crossed rays.;kirkpatrick
3;14;11433;96;‘Eliosun!’ I said. ‘You grant this accolade.’;kirkpatrick
3;14;11434;97;The galaxy, distinctly marked by lights,;kirkpatrick
3;14;11435;98;both great and small, between the earth’s two poles,;kirkpatrick
3;14;11436;99;glistens and makes the learnèd wonder why.;kirkpatrick
3;14;11437;100;So too, like constellations in the depths;kirkpatrick
3;14;11438;101;of Mars, these rays composed the honoured sign;kirkpatrick
3;14;11439;102;that quadrants (joined within a circle) form.;kirkpatrick
3;14;11440;103;And here remembering surpasses skill:;kirkpatrick
3;14;11441;104;that cross, in sudden ﬂaring, blazed out Christ so I can ﬁnd;kirkpatrick
3;14;11442;105;no ﬁt comparison.;kirkpatrick
3;14;11443;106;But those who take their cross and follow Christ;kirkpatrick
3;14;11444;107;will let me oﬀ where, wearily, I fail,;kirkpatrick
3;14;11445;108;seeing in that white dawn, as lightning, Christ.;kirkpatrick
3;14;11446;109;From horn to horn, from summit down to base,;kirkpatrick
3;14;11447;110;there moved here scintillating points of light, bright as;kirkpatrick
3;14;11448;111;their paths met, bright in passing on.;kirkpatrick
3;14;11449;112;So minute specks of matter can be seen –;kirkpatrick
3;14;11450;113;renewing how they look at every glance,;kirkpatrick
3;14;11451;114;straight in their track, oblique, long, short, swift, slow –;kirkpatrick
3;14;11452;115;moving through sunbeams that will sometimes;kirkpatrick
3;14;11453;116;streak;kirkpatrick
3;14;11454;117;the shade that people, to protect themselves,;kirkpatrick
3;14;11455;118;have won through their intelligence or art.;kirkpatrick
3;14;11456;119;As harp or viol – in tempered harmony,;kirkpatrick
3;14;11457;120;their many strings stretched tight – still ring and sing,;kirkpatrick
3;14;11458;121;even to those who do not catch the tune,;kirkpatrick
3;14;11459;122;so, though I did not understand their hymn,;kirkpatrick
3;14;11460;123;an air now gathered that enraptured me;kirkpatrick
3;14;11461;124;from lights appearing there throughout the cross.;kirkpatrick
3;14;11462;125;I realized full well it sang high praise;kirkpatrick
3;14;11463;126;for, as to one who does not understand;kirkpatrick
3;14;11464;127;yet hears, there came to me, ‘Rise up!’ and ‘Win!’;kirkpatrick
3;14;11465;128;At which, I sank so deep in love of this;kirkpatrick
3;14;11466;129;that never till that time had anything;kirkpatrick
3;14;11467;130;entrammelled me in such delightful bonds.;kirkpatrick
3;14;11468;131;These words of mine may seem perhaps too bold,;kirkpatrick
3;14;11469;132;slighting the pleasure of those lovely eyes,;kirkpatrick
3;14;11470;133;in which, when gazing, my desires all rest.;kirkpatrick
3;14;11471;134;Whoever thinks, though, that the living prints;kirkpatrick
3;14;11472;135;of every beauty grow the more they rise,;kirkpatrick
3;14;11473;136;and notices I did not turn to these,;kirkpatrick
3;14;11474;137;will make excuse for what I here confess;kirkpatrick
3;14;11475;138;to win excuse, and see me speak the truth.;kirkpatrick
3;14;11476;139;Holy delight is not excluded here.;kirkpatrick
3;14;11477;140;Rather, in rising it will grow more pure.;kirkpatrick
3;15;11478;1;Good will (to which the love that breathes aright;kirkpatrick
3;15;11479;2;will always in its distillation ﬂow,;kirkpatrick
3;15;11480;3;as does cupidity to wickedness);kirkpatrick
3;15;11481;4;brought silence to that sweetly sounding lyre,;kirkpatrick
3;15;11482;5;and stilled the motion of its holy strings,;kirkpatrick
3;15;11483;6;which Heaven’s right hand both plucks and modulates.;kirkpatrick
3;15;11484;7;How can it be that those true beings there;kirkpatrick
3;15;11485;8;whose choir of silence urged me on to pray;kirkpatrick
3;15;11486;9;will ever turn deaf ears to honest prayer?;kirkpatrick
3;15;11487;10;It’s only right that all know endless grief;kirkpatrick
3;15;11488;11;who, loving only things that can’t endure,;kirkpatrick
3;15;11489;12;steal from themselves, eternally, true love.;kirkpatrick
3;15;11490;13;Sometimes, across a pure, untroubled sky,;kirkpatrick
3;15;11491;14;there runs an instantaneous ﬂash of ﬁre,;kirkpatrick
3;15;11492;15;moving our steady eyes to trace its course,;kirkpatrick
3;15;11493;16;from which, it seems, a star is changing place,;kirkpatrick
3;15;11494;17;except that, at the point it caught alight,;kirkpatrick
3;15;11495;18;nothing is lost, nor does it last for long.;kirkpatrick
3;15;11496;19;So, from the right extension of the cross;kirkpatrick
3;15;11497;20;down to its foot, there ran an astral spark;kirkpatrick
3;15;11498;21;which left the constellation shining there.;kirkpatrick
3;15;11499;22;Nor did that gem stone leave its bezelled rim,;kirkpatrick
3;15;11500;23;but ran a length along the radial beam,;kirkpatrick
3;15;11501;24;as ﬁre behind some alabaster screen.;kirkpatrick
3;15;11502;25;So, too, the shadow of Anchises showed;kirkpatrick
3;15;11503;26;(if we give credence to our greatest muse),;kirkpatrick
3;15;11504;27;seeing his son approach him in Elysium.;kirkpatrick
3;15;11505;28;‘O sanguis meus, o superinfusa;kirkpatrick
3;15;11506;29;gratia Dei, sicut tibi cui;kirkpatrick
3;15;11507;30;bis unquam celi ianua reclusa?’;kirkpatrick
3;15;11508;31;The light spoke thus. I gave my mind to him,;kirkpatrick
3;15;11509;32;then turned to see my lady’s countenance,;kirkpatrick
3;15;11510;33;amazed at what I saw on either side.;kirkpatrick
3;15;11511;34;For laughter in her eyes now burned so bright;kirkpatrick
3;15;11512;35;that, as I thought, I touched the very depths;kirkpatrick
3;15;11513;36;of all I gloried in – and Paradise.;kirkpatrick
3;15;11514;37;Then, full of joy, in hearing as in sight,;kirkpatrick
3;15;11515;38;the spirit added to those opening words,;kirkpatrick
3;15;11516;39;which I’d not understood – he spoke so deep –;kirkpatrick
3;15;11517;40;though he’d not hidden from me out of choice,;kirkpatrick
3;15;11518;41;but rather of necessity, his thought;kirkpatrick
3;15;11519;42;so set itself above our mortal mark.;kirkpatrick
3;15;11520;43;And when the bow shot of his burning love;kirkpatrick
3;15;11521;44;had so far settled that his speech came down;kirkpatrick
3;15;11522;45;to reach the target of our intellect,;kirkpatrick
3;15;11523;46;the ﬁrst thing that I came to understand;kirkpatrick
3;15;11524;47;was: ‘Blessèd be Thou, the Triune and the One;kirkpatrick
3;15;11525;48;who’s graced my seed with so much courtesy.’;kirkpatrick
3;15;11526;49;He then went on: ‘My son, a long, glad fast –;kirkpatrick
3;15;11527;50;drawn out in reading from the noble book;kirkpatrick
3;15;11528;51;where there can be no change of white and black –;kirkpatrick
3;15;11529;52;you now relieve me of, within this light;kirkpatrick
3;15;11530;53;from which I speak. All thanks be hers;kirkpatrick
3;15;11531;54;who clothes you in the wings for this great ﬂight.;kirkpatrick
3;15;11532;55;You think that all your thoughts come down to me;kirkpatrick
3;15;11533;56;from that which is the First – as ﬁve and six;kirkpatrick
3;15;11534;57;come forth as rays, if clearly seen, from one.;kirkpatrick
3;15;11535;58;And therefore why, myself, I am and seem;kirkpatrick
3;15;11536;59;to you more jubilant than others here;kirkpatrick
3;15;11537;60;who form this happy throng, you don’t inquire.;kirkpatrick
3;15;11538;61;You think the truth. Within this rank of life,;kirkpatrick
3;15;11539;62;the greatest and the least all gaze upon;kirkpatrick
3;15;11540;63;the glass where thought, before you think, is shown.;kirkpatrick
3;15;11541;64;But (may the holy love wherein, with sight;kirkpatrick
3;15;11542;65;perpetual, I watch and whence, with sweet;kirkpatrick
3;15;11543;66;desire, I thirst, be all the more fulﬁlled!);kirkpatrick
3;15;11544;67;be conﬁdent in voice, be brave and glad;kirkpatrick
3;15;11545;68;to sound your will, to sound your best desire,;kirkpatrick
3;15;11546;69;to which my answer has been long decreed.’;kirkpatrick
3;15;11547;70;I turned to Beatrice, who had heard;kirkpatrick
3;15;11548;71;before I spoke. She smiled me such a sign;kirkpatrick
3;15;11549;72;that made the wings of will in me grow strong.;kirkpatrick
3;15;11550;73;And so I now began: ‘In you, each one,;kirkpatrick
3;15;11551;74;the heart was balanced equally with mind;kirkpatrick
3;15;11552;75;when Primal Equipoise appeared to you.;kirkpatrick
3;15;11553;76;The Sun that gleams and burns in you;kirkpatrick
3;15;11554;77;itself is, equally, both light and ﬁre,;kirkpatrick
3;15;11555;78;so ﬁnely gauged comparison falls short.;kirkpatrick
3;15;11556;79;But will and intellect in mortal minds;kirkpatrick
3;15;11557;80;(for reasons that are manifest to you);kirkpatrick
3;15;11558;81;are diﬀerent in the plumage of their wings.;kirkpatrick
3;15;11559;82;And I discern, since I am mortal, in;kirkpatrick
3;15;11560;83;myself the same unequalness. My heart;kirkpatrick
3;15;11561;84;alone must thank you for your father-words.;kirkpatrick
3;15;11562;85;Truly I beg you, Topaz live and bright,;kirkpatrick
3;15;11563;86;in-gemmed so joyfully within this jewel,;kirkpatrick
3;15;11564;87;to bring your name to me in satisfaction.’;kirkpatrick
3;15;11565;88;‘My branch and leaf (in whom I was well pleased,;kirkpatrick
3;15;11566;89;waiting until you came) I was your root.’;kirkpatrick
3;15;11567;90;His opening words, as he replied, were these.;kirkpatrick
3;15;11568;91;And then he said: ‘The one from whom your clan;kirkpatrick
3;15;11569;92;takes its cognomen has trodden now the ﬁrst ring;kirkpatrick
3;15;11570;93;of the hill below a hundred years or more.;kirkpatrick
3;15;11571;94;He was my son, to you great-grandfather.;kirkpatrick
3;15;11572;95;It’s right that, by your works on his behalf,;kirkpatrick
3;15;11573;96;you render short the time of his long labour.;kirkpatrick
3;15;11574;97;Florence, within the ancient ring, from which;kirkpatrick
3;15;11575;98;she takes the bell-sound still of terce and nones, lived on;kirkpatrick
3;15;11576;99;in modesty, chasteness and peace.;kirkpatrick
3;15;11577;100;No bangles had she, nor a showy crown,;kirkpatrick
3;15;11578;101;no exquisite, embroidered skirts, no sash;kirkpatrick
3;15;11579;102;more meant for viewing than the person was.;kirkpatrick
3;15;11580;103;As yet the birth of daughters did not bring;kirkpatrick
3;15;11581;104;fear to the father: since no wedding dower;kirkpatrick
3;15;11582;105;nor early marriage passed the proper norm.;kirkpatrick
3;15;11583;106;As yet, no house too roomy for its clan –;kirkpatrick
3;15;11584;107;no Sardanapalus had yet arrived;kirkpatrick
3;15;11585;108;to show what you can do in private rooms.;kirkpatrick
3;15;11586;109;As yet, no Monte Mario in Rome;kirkpatrick
3;15;11587;110;was beaten by your Aviary which wins;kirkpatrick
3;15;11588;111;in rising high – as well as sinking low.;kirkpatrick
3;15;11589;112;Bellincion Berti I saw girded there;kirkpatrick
3;15;11590;113;with leather and bone, and, leaving her mirror,;kirkpatrick
3;15;11591;114;his lady, her face without cosmetic.;kirkpatrick
3;15;11592;115;I saw the Nerli and del Vecchio;kirkpatrick
3;15;11593;116;content to wear the plainest skin and hide,;kirkpatrick
3;15;11594;117;their women occupied with loom and ﬂax.;kirkpatrick
3;15;11595;118;How fortunate these were, each being sure;kirkpatrick
3;15;11596;119;of where her grave would be! None yet was left;kirkpatrick
3;15;11597;120;alone in bed by men who’d gone to France.;kirkpatrick
3;15;11598;121;One, still awake, would watch around the crib;kirkpatrick
3;15;11599;122;and soothe the baby, babbling in the tongue;kirkpatrick
3;15;11600;123;that parents thrill to in the early days.;kirkpatrick
3;15;11601;124;Another, drawing tresses from the spool,;kirkpatrick
3;15;11602;125;sat with her family and told them tales;kirkpatrick
3;15;11603;126;of Trojans, of Fiesole and Rome.;kirkpatrick
3;15;11604;127;Lewd Cianghellas or sly Salterells;kirkpatrick
3;15;11605;128;would then have seemed a marvel just as great;kirkpatrick
3;15;11606;129;as Cincinnatus now or proud Cornelia.;kirkpatrick
3;15;11607;130;To this so tranquil and composed, so ﬁne;kirkpatrick
3;15;11608;131;a life of citizens, to such a true;kirkpatrick
3;15;11609;132;civility, so sweet a resting place,;kirkpatrick
3;15;11610;133;Maria gave me (birth-pangs called her name).;kirkpatrick
3;15;11611;134;And in your ancient Baptistery, I was;kirkpatrick
3;15;11612;135;a Christian, and was Cacciaguida, too.;kirkpatrick
3;15;11613;136;My brothers were Moronto and Eliseo.;kirkpatrick
3;15;11614;137;My honoured wife came down from Val di Pado,;kirkpatrick
3;15;11615;138;and hence derived the surname that you bear.;kirkpatrick
3;15;11616;139;I followed Emperor Conrad on crusade;kirkpatrick
3;15;11617;140;and, rising in his favour by my deeds,;kirkpatrick
3;15;11618;141;he bound me with all dignities of knighthood.;kirkpatrick
3;15;11619;142;I went behind him to oppose the wrong;kirkpatrick
3;15;11620;143;of that misguided law whose devotees;kirkpatrick
3;15;11621;144;usurp (it is your pastors’ fault) true justice.;kirkpatrick
3;15;11622;145;There at the hand of this foul horde was I;kirkpatrick
3;15;11623;146;unravelled from this world of vanities,;kirkpatrick
3;15;11624;147;through love of which so many are besmirched,;kirkpatrick
3;15;11625;148;and came from martyrdom to this pure peace.’;kirkpatrick
3;16;11626;1;Nobility of blood, that whim of ours!;kirkpatrick
3;16;11627;2;If here on earth, where feeling is so frail,;kirkpatrick
3;16;11628;3;you make us boast the glories you bestow,;kirkpatrick
3;16;11629;4;to me henceforth that’s nothing wonderful.;kirkpatrick
3;16;11630;5;For there – in Heaven, I mean – where appetite;kirkpatrick
3;16;11631;6;is never skewed, I, too, have boasted so.;kirkpatrick
3;16;11632;7;You are, of course, a mantle that soons shrinks.;kirkpatrick
3;16;11633;8;So if you’re not patched up from day to day,;kirkpatrick
3;16;11634;9;Time with its pinking shears will circle you.;kirkpatrick
3;16;11635;10;So with that ‘Thou’ that ancient Romans used –;kirkpatrick
3;16;11636;11;its clan, though, doesn’t keep the usage up –;kirkpatrick
3;16;11637;12;the words began once more to come from me.;kirkpatrick
3;16;11638;13;At this Beatrice (some way away);kirkpatrick
3;16;11639;14;smiled in the manner of the one who coughed;kirkpatrick
3;16;11640;15;to mark the ﬁrst mistake of Guinevere.;kirkpatrick
3;16;11641;16;Thus I began: ‘Thou art indeed my father.;kirkpatrick
3;16;11642;17;In me thou hast inspired my daring speech.;kirkpatrick
3;16;11643;18;Thou raisest me so I am more than I.;kirkpatrick
3;16;11644;19;Filled by these many streams of happiness,;kirkpatrick
3;16;11645;20;my mind rejoices in itself to bear;kirkpatrick
3;16;11646;21;so much and not be shattered by the surge.;kirkpatrick
3;16;11647;22;Tell me my earliest, my dearest growth,;kirkpatrick
3;16;11648;23;who were your own progenitors? Also,;kirkpatrick
3;16;11649;24;what years were marked for you as boy and youth.;kirkpatrick
3;16;11650;25;Tell me how great the sheepfold of Saint John;kirkpatrick
3;16;11651;26;at that time was, and which inhabitants;kirkpatrick
3;16;11652;27;deserved the most to sit on highest thrones.’;kirkpatrick
3;16;11653;28;As coals, when breezes breathe them into ﬂame,;kirkpatrick
3;16;11654;29;brighten and live, this incandescence now;kirkpatrick
3;16;11655;30;responded to my own persuasiveness.;kirkpatrick
3;16;11656;31;And as his beauty in my eyes increased,;kirkpatrick
3;16;11657;32;so too his voice grew gentler, sweeter still,;kirkpatrick
3;16;11658;33;though not in speech we moderns might employ.;kirkpatrick
3;16;11659;34;‘From when,’ he answered, ‘the “Ave” was said,;kirkpatrick
3;16;11660;35;to when my mother, sainted now, gave birth –;kirkpatrick
3;16;11661;36;lightening herself of me, the weight she bore –;kirkpatrick
3;16;11662;37;ﬁve hundred times and ﬁfty and thirty,;kirkpatrick
3;16;11663;38;this ﬁre of Mars had come to strike new ﬂame;kirkpatrick
3;16;11664;39;beneath the paws of constellation Leo.;kirkpatrick
3;16;11665;40;My ancestors (like me) had all been born;kirkpatrick
3;16;11666;41;within that district where your yearly race;kirkpatrick
3;16;11667;42;begins to enter on its ﬁnal course.;kirkpatrick
3;16;11668;43;That’s all you need to hear of my great sires.;kirkpatrick
3;16;11669;44;Of who these were and from what place they came,;kirkpatrick
3;16;11670;45;silence has greater dignity than speech.;kirkpatrick
3;16;11671;46;Between the Baptistery and Mars, the sum;kirkpatrick
3;16;11672;47;of those who rightly could bear arms was then;kirkpatrick
3;16;11673;48;a ﬁfth of those who live there nowadays.;kirkpatrick
3;16;11674;49;That population, though (now intermixed;kirkpatrick
3;16;11675;50;with Campi and Fegghine and Certaldo folk),;kirkpatrick
3;16;11676;51;was, to the merest craftsman, pure in blood.;kirkpatrick
3;16;11677;52;Better by far that those of whom I speak;kirkpatrick
3;16;11678;53;were distant neighbours still, so you maintained;kirkpatrick
3;16;11679;54;Galluzzo and Trespiano as your outer bounds,;kirkpatrick
3;16;11680;55;than have within you – and so bear the stench –;kirkpatrick
3;16;11681;56;of peasant Aguglione or that Signa cad,;kirkpatrick
3;16;11682;57;sharp-eyed as ever for a shady quid.;kirkpatrick
3;16;11683;58;If some – the very worst, degenerate priests! –;kirkpatrick
3;16;11684;59;had been as kind as mothers to their sons,;kirkpatrick
3;16;11685;60;and not played step-dame to Imperial rights,;kirkpatrick
3;16;11686;61;there’s one, now Florentine, who wheels and deals;kirkpatrick
3;16;11687;62;who’d soon have gone to Semifonte again,;kirkpatrick
3;16;11688;63;where all his forebears did their daily rounds.;kirkpatrick
3;16;11689;64;The Montemurli would be Conti serfs,;kirkpatrick
3;16;11690;65;the Cerchi still Acone villagers,;kirkpatrick
3;16;11691;66;the Buondelmonti maybe still mere Grievians.;kirkpatrick
3;16;11692;67;Miscegenation has at all times been;kirkpatrick
3;16;11693;68;the origin, in cities, of all ills,;kirkpatrick
3;16;11694;69;as when you gorge on undigested foods.;kirkpatrick
3;16;11695;70;A blinded bull falls quicker to the ground;kirkpatrick
3;16;11696;71;than any blinded lamb. A single sword;kirkpatrick
3;16;11697;72;at times cuts cleaner and more sure than ﬁve.;kirkpatrick
3;16;11698;73;Consider Urbisaglia and Luni, too,;kirkpatrick
3;16;11699;74;how both these towns have gone, and how, behind,;kirkpatrick
3;16;11700;75;go also Chiusi and Sinigaglia.;kirkpatrick
3;16;11701;76;And when whole cities have, in this way, died,;kirkpatrick
3;16;11702;77;it won’t seem strange or hard for you to hear;kirkpatrick
3;16;11703;78;that tribes and clans can likewise be unmade.;kirkpatrick
3;16;11704;79;All human things have their own deaths to meet,;kirkpatrick
3;16;11705;80;as you do also (though in some, long-lived,;kirkpatrick
3;16;11706;81;the truth of this lies hid). And lives are short.;kirkpatrick
3;16;11707;82;And, as the turning of the moon above;kirkpatrick
3;16;11708;83;covers the shore unrestingly, and then;kirkpatrick
3;16;11709;84;uncovers it, so Fortune does with Florence.;kirkpatrick
3;16;11710;85;This should not, therefore, seem remarkable –;kirkpatrick
3;16;11711;86;all I shall tell of noble Florentines,;kirkpatrick
3;16;11712;87;whose fame lies hidden now in passing time.;kirkpatrick
3;16;11713;88;I saw the Ughi, I saw the Catellini,;kirkpatrick
3;16;11714;89;Filippi, Ormanni, Greci e Alberichi,;kirkpatrick
3;16;11715;90;already in decline, illustrious men.;kirkpatrick
3;16;11716;91;As great as they were ancient, I saw, too,;kirkpatrick
3;16;11717;92;Bostichi, Soldanieri and Ardinghians,;kirkpatrick
3;16;11718;93;the Arca and Sannella here as well.;kirkpatrick
3;16;11719;94;Nearby the gate – in present times so ﬁlled;kirkpatrick
3;16;11720;95;with novel felonies of such great weight;kirkpatrick
3;16;11721;96;that soon the vessel will unship its load –;kirkpatrick
3;16;11722;97;were once the Ravignani, from whom sprang;kirkpatrick
3;16;11723;98;Count Guido, and, in later times, the clan;kirkpatrick
3;16;11724;99;that takes its name from great Bellincion.;kirkpatrick
3;16;11725;100;La Pressa knew already what it meant;kirkpatrick
3;16;11726;101;to serve in government. The Galigaio house;kirkpatrick
3;16;11727;102;displayed the golden hilt and sword of chivalry.;kirkpatrick
3;16;11728;103;The Pale of Vair already had grown great,;kirkpatrick
3;16;11729;104;Giuochi, Sacchetti, Barucci, Fifanti,;kirkpatrick
3;16;11730;105;the Galli, too – and those who blush for salt-fraud.;kirkpatrick
3;16;11731;106;The stock that bore Calfuccians by now;kirkpatrick
3;16;11732;107;was great, and also to the seats of power;kirkpatrick
3;16;11733;108;Sizii and Arrigucci had been drawn.;kirkpatrick
3;16;11734;109;How well I saw them then, those now destroyed;kirkpatrick
3;16;11735;110;by their own pride! Armorial orbs of gold;kirkpatrick
3;16;11736;111;made Florence ﬂower in all its enterprise.;kirkpatrick
3;16;11737;112;So did the fathers, too, of those who now,;kirkpatrick
3;16;11738;113;on ﬁnding that your bishop’s church is free,;kirkpatrick
3;16;11739;114;grow fat as proxies in consistory.;kirkpatrick
3;16;11740;115;That bullying crew – which dragons over those;kirkpatrick
3;16;11741;116;who run, but acts the very lamb when tooth;kirkpatrick
3;16;11742;117;or even purse is ﬂashed before its eyes –;kirkpatrick
3;16;11743;118;they had arrived, though humble in their roots –;kirkpatrick
3;16;11744;119;so Ubertin Donato looked askance;kirkpatrick
3;16;11745;120;to be their kinsman through his own wife’s line.;kirkpatrick
3;16;11746;121;The Caponsacco of Fiesole;kirkpatrick
3;16;11747;122;had now come down to join the Market Place.;kirkpatrick
3;16;11748;123;Giudi and Infangati were good citizens.;kirkpatrick
3;16;11749;124;I’ll tell you this – incredible though true:;kirkpatrick
3;16;11750;125;the gate through which one reached that little ring was;kirkpatrick
3;16;11751;126;named in honour of some Pera clan!;kirkpatrick
3;16;11752;127;Each of that House that bears upon its coat;kirkpatrick
3;16;11753;128;the name of that great baron who’s renewed,;kirkpatrick
3;16;11754;129;in worth and fame, at annual Thomas feasts,;kirkpatrick
3;16;11755;130;received from him chivalric rank and dues,;kirkpatrick
3;16;11756;131;though he who binds his fringe around this sign;kirkpatrick
3;16;11757;132;makes common cause with lower orders now.;kirkpatrick
3;16;11758;133;The Importunes and Gualterotts were here.;kirkpatrick
3;16;11759;134;The Borgo would have been a calmer place;kirkpatrick
3;16;11760;135;if they’d still lacked the neighbours that then came.;kirkpatrick
3;16;11761;136;The House from which your ﬂowing tears were born –;kirkpatrick
3;16;11762;137;driven by rancour, rightfully, that slew;kirkpatrick
3;16;11763;138;and put an end to your so-happy life –;kirkpatrick
3;16;11764;139;was honoured then, itself and all its kin.;kirkpatrick
3;16;11765;140;O Buondelmonte! You so wrongly ﬂed,;kirkpatrick
3;16;11766;141;as others urged, your marriage promises.;kirkpatrick
3;16;11767;142;Many would now rejoice who now are sad;kirkpatrick
3;16;11768;143;if God had yielded you to Ema’s stream;kirkpatrick
3;16;11769;144;when you arrived a ﬁrst time in this town.;kirkpatrick
3;16;11770;145;Yet this still had to be, that Florence made –;kirkpatrick
3;16;11771;146;at Mars’s battered stone which guards the bridge – in her;kirkpatrick
3;16;11772;147;last days of peace, this sacriﬁce.;kirkpatrick
3;16;11773;148;With all these people and with others, too,;kirkpatrick
3;16;11774;149;I saw Florentia in such repose;kirkpatrick
3;16;11775;150;that nothing could have caused it to lament.;kirkpatrick
3;16;11776;151;With all of these, so true and glorious,;kirkpatrick
3;16;11777;152;I saw your citizens, the lily-ﬂag;kirkpatrick
3;16;11778;153;not dragged, reversed upon its conquered pole,;kirkpatrick
3;16;11779;154;nor coloured in the conﬂict bright blood red.’;kirkpatrick
3;17;11780;1;As Phaeton once, approaching Clymene,;kirkpatrick
3;17;11781;2;to know for sure that news about himself;kirkpatrick
3;17;11782;3;which still makes fathers chary of their sons,;kirkpatrick
3;17;11783;4;so was I, too – and so was understood;kirkpatrick
3;17;11784;5;by Beatrice and that holy lamp;kirkpatrick
3;17;11785;6;which had, because of me, ﬁrst left its place.;kirkpatrick
3;17;11786;7;At which my lady said: ‘Send out the ﬂare;kirkpatrick
3;17;11787;8;of your desire, as clear in coming forth;kirkpatrick
3;17;11788;9;as, inwardly, the ﬁre is stamped in you,;kirkpatrick
3;17;11789;10;not to increase, by saying what that is,;kirkpatrick
3;17;11790;11;the knowledge we already have, but more;kirkpatrick
3;17;11791;12;to ﬁnd, when speaking out, we slake your thirst.’;kirkpatrick
3;17;11792;13;‘You, the dear soil in which I thrive. You so;kirkpatrick
3;17;11793;14;on-high yourself that you see well (as sure;kirkpatrick
3;17;11794;15;as mortals know, in triangles, two angles;kirkpatrick
3;17;11795;16;aren’t obtuse) contingencies before;kirkpatrick
3;17;11796;17;they come to be, your eye set wondering on;kirkpatrick
3;17;11797;18;the point at which all times are present time.;kirkpatrick
3;17;11798;19;While I was still in Virgil’s company,;kirkpatrick
3;17;11799;20;climbing the hill that remedies our souls,;kirkpatrick
3;17;11800;21;so, too, descending to the dead, waste world,;kirkpatrick
3;17;11801;22;he spoke to me in grave and weighty words;kirkpatrick
3;17;11802;23;about my future life, so I should feel;kirkpatrick
3;17;11803;24;four-square against the blows that were to come.;kirkpatrick
3;17;11804;25;I’d therefore willingly receive sure words;kirkpatrick
3;17;11805;26;that told what fortune now draws near to me.;kirkpatrick
3;17;11806;27;Those arrows that we know will come ﬂy slower.’;kirkpatrick
3;17;11807;28;I said all this to that same light that, ﬁrst,;kirkpatrick
3;17;11808;29;had spoken out to me, and thus confessed,;kirkpatrick
3;17;11809;30;as Beatrice wished, what I desired.;kirkpatrick
3;17;11810;31;Not in those enigmatic words that once;kirkpatrick
3;17;11811;32;entrammelled pagan fools, like birds in lime,;kirkpatrick
3;17;11812;33;before the Lamb of God bore oﬀ their sin,;kirkpatrick
3;17;11813;34;but clear, precise and solemn in his speech,;kirkpatrick
3;17;11814;35;that father-love now gave me his reply,;kirkpatrick
3;17;11815;36;enclosed, yet shown, in his own laughing light.;kirkpatrick
3;17;11816;37;‘Contingency, whose sphere does not extend;kirkpatrick
3;17;11817;38;beyond the margins of your earthly things,;kirkpatrick
3;17;11818;39;is framed and painted in eternal sight.;kirkpatrick
3;17;11819;40;This does not, though, imply necessity,;kirkpatrick
3;17;11820;41;except, as might be when some glass reﬂects;kirkpatrick
3;17;11821;42;a ship swept onward by a raging stream.;kirkpatrick
3;17;11822;43;From that same view there comes before my eyes;kirkpatrick
3;17;11823;44;(as to the ear sweet melodies may come);kirkpatrick
3;17;11824;45;the time that now prepares itself for you.;kirkpatrick
3;17;11825;46;As once Hippolytus was driven out;kirkpatrick
3;17;11826;47;of Athens by his father’s wife, perverse;kirkpatrick
3;17;11827;48;and pitiless, so you’ll leave Florence, too.;kirkpatrick
3;17;11828;49;This much is willed, this much already sought.;kirkpatrick
3;17;11829;50;And soon he’ll see it through, who thinks it up,;kirkpatrick
3;17;11830;51;where all day long Christ’s self is bought and sold.;kirkpatrick
3;17;11831;52;Shrill cries of blame will chase the ones who lose –;kirkpatrick
3;17;11832;53;they always do. But vengeance, when it falls,;kirkpatrick
3;17;11833;54;will speak of that same Truth that deals it out.;kirkpatrick
3;17;11834;55;You’ll leave behind you all you hold most dear.;kirkpatrick
3;17;11835;56;And this will be the grievous arrow barb;kirkpatrick
3;17;11836;57;that exile, ﬁrst of all, will shoot your way.;kirkpatrick
3;17;11837;58;And you will taste the saltiness of bread;kirkpatrick
3;17;11838;59;when oﬀered by another’s hand – as, too,;kirkpatrick
3;17;11839;60;how hard it is to climb a stranger’s stair.;kirkpatrick
3;17;11840;61;Yet what will weigh upon your shoulders worst;kirkpatrick
3;17;11841;62;is all the foul, ill-minded company;kirkpatrick
3;17;11842;63;that you, in that dark vale, will fall to keep.;kirkpatrick
3;17;11843;64;For that ungrateful, crazy, vicious crew;kirkpatrick
3;17;11844;65;will turn as one against you. Yet it’s them;kirkpatrick
3;17;11845;66;whose brows before too long will blush with shame.;kirkpatrick
3;17;11846;67;Their deeds will prove what animals they are.;kirkpatrick
3;17;11847;68;And so much so, the ﬁner course for you;kirkpatrick
3;17;11848;69;would be to form a party on your own.;kirkpatrick
3;17;11849;70;Your refuge and your safe abode will be;kirkpatrick
3;17;11850;71;the courtesy at ﬁrst of that great Lombard;kirkpatrick
3;17;11851;72;whose blazon is a stair and holy bird.;kirkpatrick
3;17;11852;73;And he will hold you in such high regard;kirkpatrick
3;17;11853;74;that “ask” and “do” between the two of you;kirkpatrick
3;17;11854;75;will place as ﬁrst what others put behind.;kirkpatrick
3;17;11855;76;You’ll see, along with him, his brother, too,;kirkpatrick
3;17;11856;77;so strongly marked, when he was born, by Mars;kirkpatrick
3;17;11857;78;that all his deeds will prove remarkable.;kirkpatrick
3;17;11858;79;People as yet know nothing of this man.;kirkpatrick
3;17;11859;80;He is still fresh and young. The astral wheels;kirkpatrick
3;17;11860;81;have worked around him for a mere nine years.;kirkpatrick
3;17;11861;82;Before the Gascon tricks great Henry, though,;kirkpatrick
3;17;11862;83;the sparks of his high virtue will appear,;kirkpatrick
3;17;11863;84;scornful of silver and the toils of war.;kirkpatrick
3;17;11864;85;His proud liberality will make its mark,;kirkpatrick
3;17;11865;86;and even enemies, in seeing that,;kirkpatrick
3;17;11866;87;will have no power to mute their tongues in praise.;kirkpatrick
3;17;11867;88;Await him, and the good he’ll bring to you.;kirkpatrick
3;17;11868;89;By him a multitude will be transformed,;kirkpatrick
3;17;11869;90;the poor exalted and the rich brought low.;kirkpatrick
3;17;11870;91;Now carry, written in your memory;kirkpatrick
3;17;11871;92;(don’t speak!), report of him.’ He then said things that;kirkpatrick
3;17;11872;93;even witnesses will not believe.;kirkpatrick
3;17;11873;94;He added, then: ‘It was of this, dear son,;kirkpatrick
3;17;11874;95;they spoke. These are the wiles and snares that lie;kirkpatrick
3;17;11875;96;concealed by some few circlings of the stars.;kirkpatrick
3;17;11876;97;Yet I’d not have you envy those around.;kirkpatrick
3;17;11877;98;Your life and fame en-futures far beyond;kirkpatrick
3;17;11878;99;the punishment their perﬁdy receives.’;kirkpatrick
3;17;11879;100;Now falling silent, that most sacred soul;kirkpatrick
3;17;11880;101;declared his hand unburdened of the thread;kirkpatrick
3;17;11881;102;of that taut weave which I had stretched for him.;kirkpatrick
3;17;11882;103;So I began – as anyone in doubt;kirkpatrick
3;17;11883;104;goes on and craves good counsel from the one;kirkpatrick
3;17;11884;105;who sees, whose will is right, whose love is strong.;kirkpatrick
3;17;11885;106;‘I now see clearly, Father, how the years spur down;kirkpatrick
3;17;11886;107;on me – and how the blow they mean to strike;kirkpatrick
3;17;11887;108;is worse to those who, ﬂeeing, ﬂinch aside.;kirkpatrick
3;17;11888;109;It’s better, then, I arm myself with foresight,;kirkpatrick
3;17;11889;110;so if that dearest place is snatched away,;kirkpatrick
3;17;11890;111;my verses do not lose me all the rest.;kirkpatrick
3;17;11891;112;Down through the world of endless bitterness,;kirkpatrick
3;17;11892;113;around the mountain where my lady’s look;kirkpatrick
3;17;11893;114;raised me so I could reach its lovely peak,;kirkpatrick
3;17;11894;115;then through these heavenly spheres, from light to light;kirkpatrick
3;17;11895;116;I’ve learnt of things which, if I now repeat,;kirkpatrick
3;17;11896;117;will leave in many mouths an acid taste.;kirkpatrick
3;17;11897;118;And if I prove a timid friend to truth;kirkpatrick
3;17;11898;119;I shall, I fear, forego my life among;kirkpatrick
3;17;11899;120;those souls who’ll count as ancient our own time.’;kirkpatrick
3;17;11900;121;The light in which the treasure I found there;kirkpatrick
3;17;11901;122;was smiling still, ﬁrst blazed in coruscations;kirkpatrick
3;17;11902;123;as will a ray of sun in golden mirrors,;kirkpatrick
3;17;11903;124;and then replied: ‘All murky consciences,;kirkpatrick
3;17;11904;125;who feel their own or any other’s shame;kirkpatrick
3;17;11905;126;are bound to baulk at your abrasive words.;kirkpatrick
3;17;11906;127;But none the less, all lies put clean aside,;kirkpatrick
3;17;11907;128;make plain what in your vision you have seen,;kirkpatrick
3;17;11908;129;and let them scratch wherever they may itch.;kirkpatrick
3;17;11909;130;For if at ﬁrst your voice tastes odious,;kirkpatrick
3;17;11910;131;still it will oﬀer, as digestion works,;kirkpatrick
3;17;11911;132;life-giving nutriment to those who eat.;kirkpatrick
3;17;11912;133;The words you shout will be like blasts of wind;kirkpatrick
3;17;11913;134;that strike the very summit of the trees.;kirkpatrick
3;17;11914;135;And this will bring no small degree of fame.;kirkpatrick
3;17;11915;136;For you’ve been shown in all these circling wheels –;kirkpatrick
3;17;11916;137;around the mountain, in the sorrowing vale –;kirkpatrick
3;17;11917;138;only those souls whose fame is widely known,;kirkpatrick
3;17;11918;139;since those who hear you speak will never pause;kirkpatrick
3;17;11919;140;or give belief to any instances;kirkpatrick
3;17;11920;141;whose family roots are hidden or unknown,;kirkpatrick
3;18;11921;1;Already, whole in happiness, that mirror;kirkpatrick
3;18;11922;2;had turned, rejoicing, to its own true word.;kirkpatrick
3;18;11923;3;I tasted mine – and tempered sour with sweet.;kirkpatrick
3;18;11924;4;And then that lady, leading me to God,;kirkpatrick
3;18;11925;5;spoke out: ‘Revise those thoughts. Think this, that I am;kirkpatrick
3;18;11926;6;near to Him who lifts all wrongs away.’;kirkpatrick
3;18;11927;7;I turned towards that sound so full of love;kirkpatrick
3;18;11928;8;(my strength, my comforter!) but saw, within;kirkpatrick
3;18;11929;9;those holy eyes, a love I leave unsaid,;kirkpatrick
3;18;11930;10;unsure not only of my powers of speech,;kirkpatrick
3;18;11931;11;but Memory, as well – which cannot, if not led,;kirkpatrick
3;18;11932;12;return, above itself, to that degree.;kirkpatrick
3;18;11933;13;This much of that one point I can repeat:;kirkpatrick
3;18;11934;14;my heart, in awe now looking back at her,;kirkpatrick
3;18;11935;15;was free of all desires, save that alone –;kirkpatrick
3;18;11936;16;as long, at least, as eternal pleasure,;kirkpatrick
3;18;11937;17;shining in Beatrice’s lovely eyes,;kirkpatrick
3;18;11938;18;made me, in its reﬂected view, content.;kirkpatrick
3;18;11939;19;A smile – its light defeating me – she now;kirkpatrick
3;18;11940;20;addressed me: ‘Turn around. Pay heed to him.;kirkpatrick
3;18;11941;21;Heaven is found not only in my eyes.’;kirkpatrick
3;18;11942;22;As sometimes here on earth a face is seen;kirkpatrick
3;18;11943;23;displaying all its feelings – when the soul;kirkpatrick
3;18;11944;24;is caught completely in these sentiments –;kirkpatrick
3;18;11945;25;so in the ﬂaming of that holy ﬂare,;kirkpatrick
3;18;11946;26;as now I turned to it, I recognized;kirkpatrick
3;18;11947;27;a will to have some further words with me.;kirkpatrick
3;18;11948;28;‘In this, the ﬁfth espalier of that tree;kirkpatrick
3;18;11949;29;that thrives,’ so he began, ‘from summit down,;kirkpatrick
3;18;11950;30;bears constant fruit and never loses leaf,;kirkpatrick
3;18;11951;31;are spirits of the blessed who, there below,;kirkpatrick
3;18;11952;32;won such renown before they reached these spheres that;kirkpatrick
3;18;11953;33;any muse which sang of them would thrive.;kirkpatrick
3;18;11954;34;So look in wonder on this Cross’s horns.;kirkpatrick
3;18;11955;35;Each one I name to you will act as does;kirkpatrick
3;18;11956;36;the swift ﬁre darting through a thunder cloud.’;kirkpatrick
3;18;11957;37;I saw, along the Cross-tree’s beam, a light,;kirkpatrick
3;18;11958;38;drawn all along that length by Joshua’s name.;kirkpatrick
3;18;11959;39;Nor did I note the name before the deed.;kirkpatrick
3;18;11960;40;Then at the name of great Maccabeus,;kirkpatrick
3;18;11961;41;I saw another, wheeling as it moved,;kirkpatrick
3;18;11962;42;a spinning top whipped round by happiness.;kirkpatrick
3;18;11963;43;Then, as the eye will track a falcon’s ﬂight,;kirkpatrick
3;18;11964;44;my own attentive gaze now followed two,;kirkpatrick
3;18;11965;45;seeking out Roland and great Charlemagne.;kirkpatrick
3;18;11966;46;And then along the Cross my sight was drawn;kirkpatrick
3;18;11967;47;to William, Reynald, Godfrey of Bouillon,;kirkpatrick
3;18;11968;48;and with them, too, Roberto Guiscardo.;kirkpatrick
3;18;11969;49;Then moving, mingling with the other lights,;kirkpatrick
3;18;11970;50;the soul that ﬁrst had spoken now displayed;kirkpatrick
3;18;11971;51;his own great art with these who sang the skies.;kirkpatrick
3;18;11972;52;I turned to Beatrice at my right,;kirkpatrick
3;18;11973;53;to see in her some gesture, word or sign,;kirkpatrick
3;18;11974;54;to show me what my duty now must be,;kirkpatrick
3;18;11975;55;and saw the light within her eye so clear,;kirkpatrick
3;18;11976;56;so full of laughter that her look and air;kirkpatrick
3;18;11977;57;defeated all that these, before, had been.;kirkpatrick
3;18;11978;58;And, as we recognize from day to day;kirkpatrick
3;18;11979;59;that we, in doing good, have now advanced;kirkpatrick
3;18;11980;60;when, doing good, we feel a greater joy,;kirkpatrick
3;18;11981;61;so, too, as with the skies I circled round,;kirkpatrick
3;18;11982;62;I knew the arc through which we swung had grown, seeing;kirkpatrick
3;18;11983;63;that miracle yet more adorned.;kirkpatrick
3;18;11984;64;Compare: within the briefest span of time,;kirkpatrick
3;18;11985;65;a lady pale in countenance will change,;kirkpatrick
3;18;11986;66;when once she frees her blushing cheeks from shame.;kirkpatrick
3;18;11987;67;At that same speed, turning, my eyes received;kirkpatrick
3;18;11988;68;the candour of the temperate star – the sixth –;kirkpatrick
3;18;11989;69;which now collected me within its sphere.;kirkpatrick
3;18;11990;70;I saw in that great torch of Jupiter;kirkpatrick
3;18;11991;71;the scintillations of a love that, here,;kirkpatrick
3;18;11992;72;sparked signs before my eyes in human speech.;kirkpatrick
3;18;11993;73;Like birds that rise above a river bank;kirkpatrick
3;18;11994;74;and, chorusing in joy at food they ﬁnd,;kirkpatrick
3;18;11995;75;form ﬂying discs and various other shapes,;kirkpatrick
3;18;11996;76;so, deep in light, these holy creatures sang;kirkpatrick
3;18;11997;77;and, as they winged around, they now assumed;kirkpatrick
3;18;11998;78;the ﬁgure of a D, then I, then L.;kirkpatrick
3;18;11999;79;Singing, at ﬁrst, the notes of their own tune,;kirkpatrick
3;18;12000;80;they then (becoming one of these three signs);kirkpatrick
3;18;12001;81;paused for a moment and let silence fall.;kirkpatrick
3;18;12002;82;You holy Pegasean Muse, who grants;kirkpatrick
3;18;12003;83;to intellect its glory and long fame –;kirkpatrick
3;18;12004;84;as, through such minds, to realms and cities, too –;kirkpatrick
3;18;12005;85;inspire me with your light, so I may draw;kirkpatrick
3;18;12006;86;those ﬁgures as I ﬁrst conceived they were.;kirkpatrick
3;18;12007;87;In these brief verses let your power appear.;kirkpatrick
3;18;12008;88;In ﬁve times seven vowels and consonants;kirkpatrick
3;18;12009;89;it fashioned this display. And I took note;kirkpatrick
3;18;12010;90;of all these parts as they appeared to me.;kirkpatrick
3;18;12011;91;DILIGITE IUSTITIAM : these ﬁrst –;kirkpatrick
3;18;12012;92;main verb and noun of all that bright design.;kirkpatrick
3;18;12013;93;QUI IUDICATIS TERRAM – these came last.;kirkpatrick
3;18;12014;94;And then they gathered on the ﬁnal M,;kirkpatrick
3;18;12015;95;arranged so Jupiter seemed silver now;kirkpatrick
3;18;12016;96;picked out in painted ornaments of gold.;kirkpatrick
3;18;12017;97;And then I saw, descending, other lights;kirkpatrick
3;18;12018;98;to mount the summit of the M and pause,;kirkpatrick
3;18;12019;99;singing the Good, I think, that drew them to him.;kirkpatrick
3;18;12020;100;Then, as when burning logs are struck, and sparks,;kirkpatrick
3;18;12021;101;beyond all number, rise around (from which;kirkpatrick
3;18;12022;102;fools, once, in pagan times drew auguries),;kirkpatrick
3;18;12023;103;it seemed that from this more than a thousand;kirkpatrick
3;18;12024;104;lights rose surging up, some higher, some less,;kirkpatrick
3;18;12025;105;as God’s sun, kindling them, ascribed their place.;kirkpatrick
3;18;12026;106;And, once each rested at its proper point,;kirkpatrick
3;18;12027;107;I saw, distinctly shown in golden ﬁre,;kirkpatrick
3;18;12028;108;the image of an Eagle’s head and neck.;kirkpatrick
3;18;12029;109;He who paints there needs none to guide his hand.;kirkpatrick
3;18;12030;110;He is the guide. From Him, we recognize,;kirkpatrick
3;18;12031;111;derives the power that forms in our own nests.;kirkpatrick
3;18;12032;112;Those others in beatitude who, ﬁrst,;kirkpatrick
3;18;12033;113;in-lilying the M, had been content,;kirkpatrick
3;18;12034;114;now joined, with no great movement, that same sign.;kirkpatrick
3;18;12035;115;Sweetest of stars! So many gems, so ﬁne,;kirkpatrick
3;18;12036;116;to make this known to me! Our justice is;kirkpatrick
3;18;12037;117;produced by that great sky that you in-gem.;kirkpatrick
3;18;12038;118;So I beseech the Mind, in which begins;kirkpatrick
3;18;12039;119;the motion and the strength you have, now look;kirkpatrick
3;18;12040;120;at where the fumes arise that taint your rays,;kirkpatrick
3;18;12041;121;so that a second time He should now rage;kirkpatrick
3;18;12042;122;at ‘buy’ and ‘sell’ within those temple walls,;kirkpatrick
3;18;12043;123;once built by miracles and martyrdom.;kirkpatrick
3;18;12044;124;You heavenly army that I gaze on now,;kirkpatrick
3;18;12045;125;pray earnestly for those who are, on earth,;kirkpatrick
3;18;12046;126;led by this vile example all astray.;kirkpatrick
3;18;12047;127;War was at one time waged with swords alone.;kirkpatrick
3;18;12048;128;But now it’s done by snatching, here and there,;kirkpatrick
3;18;12049;129;the bread our loving Father locks from none.;kirkpatrick
3;18;12050;130;But you – I write of you to blot you out –;kirkpatrick
3;18;12051;131;just think that Paul and Peter who both died;kirkpatrick
3;18;12052;132;to serve the vine that you lay waste, live still.;kirkpatrick
3;18;12053;133;You may well say: ‘I’m ﬁrm in my desire;kirkpatrick
3;18;12054;134;to be like John who lived his life alone,;kirkpatrick
3;18;12055;135;drawn to his martyrdom by sprightly dance,;kirkpatrick
3;18;12056;136;and so don’t know this ﬁsherman, or Paul.’;kirkpatrick
3;19;12057;1;It showed before me now with open wings –;kirkpatrick
3;19;12058;2;that lovely emblem which those happy souls;kirkpatrick
3;19;12059;3;composed in utmost frui , interwoven.;kirkpatrick
3;19;12060;4;Each soul showed forth as minute rubies might.;kirkpatrick
3;19;12061;5;In each a sun ray burned with such new ﬁre;kirkpatrick
3;19;12062;6;its light, reﬂected, broke back from my eyes.;kirkpatrick
3;19;12063;7;But now there’s something I must draw to mind;kirkpatrick
3;19;12064;8;that no voice ever carried, ink inscribed,;kirkpatrick
3;19;12065;9;or great imagination ever grasped.;kirkpatrick
3;19;12066;10;I saw and heard that Eagle’s beak form words;kirkpatrick
3;19;12067;11;that rang, in what they voiced, as ‘I’ and ‘mine’,;kirkpatrick
3;19;12068;12;although in meaning they were ‘we’ and ‘us’.;kirkpatrick
3;19;12069;13;‘I am’ – beginning so – ‘through being true;kirkpatrick
3;19;12070;14;and just in all things, raised to glorious heights;kirkpatrick
3;19;12071;15;that no desire could ever overcome.;kirkpatrick
3;19;12072;16;On earth I leave so great a memory;kirkpatrick
3;19;12073;17;that even evil-minded men down there;kirkpatrick
3;19;12074;18;who don’t take up the tale still honour it.’;kirkpatrick
3;19;12075;19;From many coals we feel one wave of heat.;kirkpatrick
3;19;12076;20;So, too, from all these many loving souls,;kirkpatrick
3;19;12077;21;a single sound came issuing from its form.;kirkpatrick
3;19;12078;22;So I at once: ‘You are, perpetually,;kirkpatrick
3;19;12079;23;the ﬂowerings of eternal happiness.;kirkpatrick
3;19;12080;24;And all your perfumes are, to me, as one.;kirkpatrick
3;19;12081;25;Breathing upon me, set me free, untie;kirkpatrick
3;19;12082;26;the hankering that’s held me now so long,;kirkpatrick
3;19;12083;27;On earth I ﬁnd no food for it at all.;kirkpatrick
3;19;12084;28;God’s justice, as I know from all I’ve seen,;kirkpatrick
3;19;12085;29;is mirrored, in these spheres, by other realms.;kirkpatrick
3;19;12086;30;But your sphere comprehends it, through no veil.;kirkpatrick
3;19;12087;31;And you know how attentively I’ve come,;kirkpatrick
3;19;12088;32;prepared to hear. You know the doubt as well,;kirkpatrick
3;19;12089;33;the old, long hungering I suﬀer from.’;kirkpatrick
3;19;12090;34;As falcons, shaking free from training-hoods,;kirkpatrick
3;19;12091;35;will move their heads, applauding with their wings,;kirkpatrick
3;19;12092;36;to show their zeal and make themselves look ﬁne,;kirkpatrick
3;19;12093;37;so did this emblem, woven out of praise;kirkpatrick
3;19;12094;38;that sang the glory of God’s grace, in hymns;kirkpatrick
3;19;12095;39;that those who celebrate above will know.;kirkpatrick
3;19;12096;40;‘The One who turned His compass,’ it began,;kirkpatrick
3;19;12097;41;‘around the reaches of the universe,;kirkpatrick
3;19;12098;42;and marked, within, things clear and dark to view,;kirkpatrick
3;19;12099;43;might blaze His worth upon that cosmic plan,;kirkpatrick
3;19;12100;44;yet could not fail, in doing so, to leave,;kirkpatrick
3;19;12101;45;as inﬁnite excess, His truest word.;kirkpatrick
3;19;12102;46;As proof of this, that being, ﬁrst in pride,;kirkpatrick
3;19;12103;47;the summit, once, of all creation, fell –;kirkpatrick
3;19;12104;48;he would not wait for light – acid, unripe.;kirkpatrick
3;19;12105;49;From which it’s clear that natures less than his;kirkpatrick
3;19;12106;50;are all too shallow to contain that Good;kirkpatrick
3;19;12107;51;which has no end and measures self by self.;kirkpatrick
3;19;12108;52;Therefore, the powers of sight that you possess –;kirkpatrick
3;19;12109;53;which must exist as rays from that one Mind;kirkpatrick
3;19;12110;54;with which all things that are are brimming full –;kirkpatrick
3;19;12111;55;cannot, in their own nature, be so great;kirkpatrick
3;19;12112;56;that their Original should not have sight;kirkpatrick
3;19;12113;57;of much beyond what, there, appears to them.;kirkpatrick
3;19;12114;58;It follows that the sight your world receives;kirkpatrick
3;19;12115;59;in sempiternal justice sinks itself;kirkpatrick
3;19;12116;60;three-fold as deep as eyes in open sea.;kirkpatrick
3;19;12117;61;Although you see the bottom near the shore,;kirkpatrick
3;19;12118;62;the ocean ﬂoor you can’t. And yet it’s there.;kirkpatrick
3;19;12119;63;Its depths conceal its being so profound.;kirkpatrick
3;19;12120;64;There is no light except from that clear calm,;kirkpatrick
3;19;12121;65;changeless, untroubled. Others are tenebrae,;kirkpatrick
3;19;12122;66;the shadows or the venom of the ﬂesh.;kirkpatrick
3;19;12123;67;It’s open now enough, that brooding deep –;kirkpatrick
3;19;12124;68;where, hidden from you, living justice lay –;kirkpatrick
3;19;12125;69;of which so frequently you’ve made demand.;kirkpatrick
3;19;12126;70;“A man is born,” you’ve said repeatedly,;kirkpatrick
3;19;12127;71;“beside the Indus. And there’s no one there;kirkpatrick
3;19;12128;72;who speaks of Christ, or reads or writes of Him.;kirkpatrick
3;19;12129;73;And all he does and all he means to do –;kirkpatrick
3;19;12130;74;as far as human minds can tell – is good,;kirkpatrick
3;19;12131;75;sinless alike in living and in word.;kirkpatrick
3;19;12132;76;Then, unbaptized, beyond the faith, he dies.;kirkpatrick
3;19;12133;77;Where is the justice that condemns him thus?;kirkpatrick
3;19;12134;78;Where is his guilt, if he does not believe?”;kirkpatrick
3;19;12135;79;Well, who are you to sit there on your throne,;kirkpatrick
3;19;12136;80;acting the judge a thousand miles away,;kirkpatrick
3;19;12137;81;eyesight as short as some mere ﬁnger span?;kirkpatrick
3;19;12138;82;Of course, all those who seek to pin me down;kirkpatrick
3;19;12139;83;might ﬁnd amazing reasons for their doubts,;kirkpatrick
3;19;12140;84;except the Scriptures are set over you.;kirkpatrick
3;19;12141;85;You earthbound creatures, dense in thought and head!;kirkpatrick
3;19;12142;86;The Primal Will, which of itself is good,;kirkpatrick
3;19;12143;87;has never from its own high good been moved.;kirkpatrick
3;19;12144;88;What counts as just will ring in tune with that.;kirkpatrick
3;19;12145;89;No creature-good draws that will to itself.;kirkpatrick
3;19;12146;90;But that – its rays projecting – causes this.’;kirkpatrick
3;19;12147;91;Compare: a mother stork has fed its young;kirkpatrick
3;19;12148;92;and, while its chick, well-nourished, gazes up,;kirkpatrick
3;19;12149;93;it ﬂies in circles high above the nest.;kirkpatrick
3;19;12150;94;So, too, it rose – I raised my brows to it –;kirkpatrick
3;19;12151;95;that emblem in its blessedness, which moved;kirkpatrick
3;19;12152;96;with wings supported on the truths it spoke.;kirkpatrick
3;19;12153;97;Wheeling, it sang and, singing, said: ‘To you;kirkpatrick
3;19;12154;98;our melodies – which you don’t understand –;kirkpatrick
3;19;12155;99;are as eternal justice is to mortal minds.’;kirkpatrick
3;19;12156;100;And then these glowing ﬁres of Holy Breath;kirkpatrick
3;19;12157;101;grew quiet once again within that sign;kirkpatrick
3;19;12158;102;which, in the world, made Romans so revered,;kirkpatrick
3;19;12159;103;then spoke anew: ‘There is, in this realm, none;kirkpatrick
3;19;12160;104;who ever rose that had no faith in Christ;kirkpatrick
3;19;12161;105;since, or before, they nailed Him to the wood.;kirkpatrick
3;19;12162;106;But see this: many cry out: “Christ! Christ! Christ!”;kirkpatrick
3;19;12163;107;Yet many will, come Judgement, be to Him;kirkpatrick
3;19;12164;108;less prope than are those who don’t know Christ.;kirkpatrick
3;19;12165;109;And Christians such as these the Ethiopian;kirkpatrick
3;19;12166;110;will damn when souls divide between two schools,;kirkpatrick
3;19;12167;111;some to eternal riches, some to dearth.;kirkpatrick
3;19;12168;112;What will the Persians say about your kings,;kirkpatrick
3;19;12169;113;when once they see that ledger opened up;kirkpatrick
3;19;12170;114;in which is written all their praiseless doings.;kirkpatrick
3;19;12171;115;P eer at that page, and see in Albert’s deeds;kirkpatrick
3;19;12172;116;one – which will shortly stir God’s pen to write –;kirkpatrick
3;19;12173;117;by which the realm of Prague lies waste and dead.;kirkpatrick
3;19;12174;118;P eer at that page, and see there one who grieved;kirkpatrick
3;19;12175;119;the Seine in uttering his worthless coin,;kirkpatrick
3;19;12176;120;dying when toppled by a wild boar’s hide.;kirkpatrick
3;19;12177;121;P eer at that page, and you’ll see there the pride;kirkpatrick
3;19;12178;122;that sharpens in mad Englishmen and Scots;kirkpatrick
3;19;12179;123;such thirst that neither keeps their native bounds.;kirkpatrick
3;19;12180;124;O there you’ll see the lust and lecherous lives;kirkpatrick
3;19;12181;125;of Spanish and Bohemian sovereigns,;kirkpatrick
3;19;12182;126;who know no honour, nor desire to know.;kirkpatrick
3;19;12183;127;O there you’ll see the Cripple of Jerusalem;kirkpatrick
3;19;12184;128;scoring mere “one” for virtuous eﬀect,;kirkpatrick
3;19;12185;129;and thousands in the column opposite.;kirkpatrick
3;19;12186;130;O there you’ll see the weak-kneed graspingness;kirkpatrick
3;19;12187;131;of one who governs in the isle of ﬁre;kirkpatrick
3;19;12188;132;where once Anchises ended his long days.;kirkpatrick
3;19;12189;133;’X cept, to show how paltry his deeds are;kirkpatrick
3;19;12190;134;the writing here will be in brief, maimed words,;kirkpatrick
3;19;12191;135;and thus will note down much in little space.;kirkpatrick
3;19;12192;136;’X cept, to all the loathsome acts will show;kirkpatrick
3;19;12193;137;of nuncle and his brud, those two who turned;kirkpatrick
3;19;12194;138;so great a race to cuckolds – and two crowns.;kirkpatrick
3;19;12195;139;’X cept, the Portuguese and Norway kings;kirkpatrick
3;19;12196;140;will there be recognized, the Rascian, too,;kirkpatrick
3;19;12197;141;who set eyes falsely on Venetian coin.;kirkpatrick
3;19;12198;142;O blessèd Hungary, if you resist;kirkpatrick
3;19;12199;143;further bad government! Blessèd Navarre,;kirkpatrick
3;19;12200;144;if you can arm the hills that swaddle you!;kirkpatrick
3;19;12201;145;And that is pledged, as all should well believe,;kirkpatrick
3;19;12202;146;by French-ruled Nicosia and Famagosta,;kirkpatrick
3;19;12203;147;lamenting, shrieking in their agony;kirkpatrick
3;19;12204;148;against their beast, who huddles with the rest.’;kirkpatrick
3;20;12205;1;When he whose ﬂame casts light round all the world;kirkpatrick
3;20;12206;2;goes down and leaves our northern hemisphere –;kirkpatrick
3;20;12207;3;and daylight therefore fades throughout these parts –;kirkpatrick
3;20;12208;4;the sky, once lighted by the sun alone,;kirkpatrick
3;20;12209;5;seems suddenly made new by many ﬂares,;kirkpatrick
3;20;12210;6;reﬂections kindled from that single source.;kirkpatrick
3;20;12211;7;These movements of our sky here came to mind;kirkpatrick
3;20;12212;8;as now the world’s great sign – true guide of kings – fell;kirkpatrick
3;20;12213;9;silent at its blessèd raptor-beak.;kirkpatrick
3;20;12214;10;For all those lights, so vividly alive,;kirkpatrick
3;20;12215;11;shining more brightly still, began a song;kirkpatrick
3;20;12216;12;that glides like falling leaves from memory.;kirkpatrick
3;20;12217;13;Love, which in laughter sweetly clothes itself,;kirkpatrick
3;20;12218;14;how ardent in those piercing pipes you burned,;kirkpatrick
3;20;12219;15;voiced by the breath of holy thoughts alone.;kirkpatrick
3;20;12220;16;When all those lucid and so precious gems;kirkpatrick
3;20;12221;17;with which, I saw, the sixth great light was set;kirkpatrick
3;20;12222;18;had brought to silence their angelic peal,;kirkpatrick
3;20;12223;19;I heard, it seemed, the murmur of a river,;kirkpatrick
3;20;12224;20;falling from rock to rock in limpid streams;kirkpatrick
3;20;12225;21;that show the swelling richness of its source.;kirkpatrick
3;20;12226;22;Compare: guitar notes sound from where the fret;kirkpatrick
3;20;12227;23;gets pressed – as, likewise, at its apertures;kirkpatrick
3;20;12228;24;a reedy ﬂute when pierced by breaths of wind.;kirkpatrick
3;20;12229;25;So here, the moment of delay now done,;kirkpatrick
3;20;12230;26;that murmur, as in hollow columns, rose;kirkpatrick
3;20;12231;27;through all the length of this great Eagle’s neck.;kirkpatrick
3;20;12232;28;It formed there as a voice and, through the bill,;kirkpatrick
3;20;12233;29;the phrases came, in words which I, at heart –;kirkpatrick
3;20;12234;30;where I inscribed them all – was waiting for.;kirkpatrick
3;20;12235;31;‘This,’ it began, ‘is now required of you,;kirkpatrick
3;20;12236;32;to look, eyes ﬁxed, upon that part of me;kirkpatrick
3;20;12237;33;that sees, in earthly eagles, yet endures, the sun.;kirkpatrick
3;20;12238;34;Of all the ﬁres from which I frame my form,;kirkpatrick
3;20;12239;35;those sparks that make the eye shine in my head;kirkpatrick
3;20;12240;36;appear as highest of the many grades.;kirkpatrick
3;20;12241;37;There, at the centre of the pupil, see;kirkpatrick
3;20;12242;38;David, the singer of the Holy Ghost,;kirkpatrick
3;20;12243;39;who bore the Ark of God from place to place.;kirkpatrick
3;20;12244;40;And now he knows the merit of his song –;kirkpatrick
3;20;12245;41;as far as his own thought produced such verse –;kirkpatrick
3;20;12246;42;here seeing how he’s paid in equal kind.;kirkpatrick
3;20;12247;43;Then, of those ﬁve whose circle forms my brow,;kirkpatrick
3;20;12248;44;he who is closest to my bill’s high bridge;kirkpatrick
3;20;12249;45;consoled the widow for her murdered son.;kirkpatrick
3;20;12250;46;And now he knows how great a price is paid;kirkpatrick
3;20;12251;47;by those who aren’t by choice Christ’s followers.;kirkpatrick
3;20;12252;48;He’s known life’s sweetness and its contrary.;kirkpatrick
3;20;12253;49;The one who’s next in that circumference –;kirkpatrick
3;20;12254;50;forming, I mean, around the upper brow –;kirkpatrick
3;20;12255;51;made death, by his true penitence, come slow.;kirkpatrick
3;20;12256;52;And now he knows eternal justice stands,;kirkpatrick
3;20;12257;53;and does not alter when a worthy prayer;kirkpatrick
3;20;12258;54;down there procrastinates quotidian things.;kirkpatrick
3;20;12259;55;There follows next the one who, though his aims;kirkpatrick
3;20;12260;56;were good, brought forth bad fruit, surrendering – now;kirkpatrick
3;20;12261;57;Greek – with Law and Eagle-signs to Popes.;kirkpatrick
3;20;12262;58;And here he knows that, though the world is wrecked,;kirkpatrick
3;20;12263;59;the ill deriving from his well-meant act;kirkpatrick
3;20;12264;60;has here for him no baneful consequence.;kirkpatrick
3;20;12265;61;The one you see in that declining arc;kirkpatrick
3;20;12266;62;was William, long-lamented by the land;kirkpatrick
3;20;12267;63;that weeps that Charles lives still – and Frederick, too.;kirkpatrick
3;20;12268;64;And here he knows what love this heaven feels;kirkpatrick
3;20;12269;65;for righteous kings, and here he still displays;kirkpatrick
3;20;12270;66;that understanding by his brilliant light.;kirkpatrick
3;20;12271;67;And who, in that erroneous world down there,;kirkpatrick
3;20;12272;68;would ever think that Trojan Ripheus;kirkpatrick
3;20;12273;69;was ﬁfth within that round of holy lights?;kirkpatrick
3;20;12274;70;Here, he now knows far more about God’s grace –;kirkpatrick
3;20;12275;71;although his vision does not pierce the depths –;kirkpatrick
3;20;12276;72;than any in the earthly world can see.’;kirkpatrick
3;20;12277;73;A lark, as ﬁrst it mounts through airy space,;kirkpatrick
3;20;12278;74;soars upward singing but is silent then,;kirkpatrick
3;20;12279;75;ﬂush with the sweetness of its highest reach.;kirkpatrick
3;20;12280;76;So, too, it seemed, that image of the print;kirkpatrick
3;20;12281;77;of everlasting joy, at whose desire;kirkpatrick
3;20;12282;78;each thing becomes what truly each thing is.;kirkpatrick
3;20;12283;79;And though, in what I meant to ask, I was,;kirkpatrick
3;20;12284;80;maybe, as glass that shows the hue it clothes,;kirkpatrick
3;20;12285;81;these doubts could bear no silent waiting time,;kirkpatrick
3;20;12286;82;but forced from my tensed lips: ‘What is all this?’;kirkpatrick
3;20;12287;83;with all their weight and gathered impetus.;kirkpatrick
3;20;12288;84;At which I saw a fěte of coruscations.;kirkpatrick
3;20;12289;85;And after – as its eye burned brighter still –;kirkpatrick
3;20;12290;86;that blessèd sign then gave me its reply,;kirkpatrick
3;20;12291;87;so I’d not hang there long in wonderment.;kirkpatrick
3;20;12292;88;‘I see that you, because I say these things,;kirkpatrick
3;20;12293;89;believe they’re so and yet cannot see why,;kirkpatrick
3;20;12294;90;so these are hidden even though believed.;kirkpatrick
3;20;12295;91;You act like someone who may know quite well;kirkpatrick
3;20;12296;92;the name but not the essence of a thing,;kirkpatrick
3;20;12297;93;unless by demonstration made to see.;kirkpatrick
3;20;12298;94;Regnum celorum will submit to force;kirkpatrick
3;20;12299;95;assailed by warmth of love or living hope,;kirkpatrick
3;20;12300;96;which overcome the claims of God’s own will,;kirkpatrick
3;20;12301;97;not in the manner that men beat down men;kirkpatrick
3;20;12302;98;but win because will wishes to be won;kirkpatrick
3;20;12303;99;and, won, wills all with all its own good will.;kirkpatrick
3;20;12304;100;The ﬁrst life and the ﬁfth that mark this brow;kirkpatrick
3;20;12305;101;cause you to wonder. You’re amazed to see;kirkpatrick
3;20;12306;102;the realm of angels painted with these lights.;kirkpatrick
3;20;12307;103;They left their bodies, contra your belief,;kirkpatrick
3;20;12308;104;as Christian souls, not Gentiles, ﬁrm in faith;kirkpatrick
3;20;12309;105;that His feet paced to past or coming pain.;kirkpatrick
3;20;12310;106;Trajan from Hell – from where, to exercise;kirkpatrick
3;20;12311;107;good will no soul returns – came back to bone,;kirkpatrick
3;20;12312;108;this mercy granted him for living hope.;kirkpatrick
3;20;12313;109;For living hope committed all its powers;kirkpatrick
3;20;12314;110;in prayer to God to raise him up once more,;kirkpatrick
3;20;12315;111;so that he could, in will, be made to move.;kirkpatrick
3;20;12316;112;The glorious soul that we’re now speaking of,;kirkpatrick
3;20;12317;113;returning even brieﬂy to his ﬂesh,;kirkpatrick
3;20;12318;114;believed in Him whose power could bring him aid,;kirkpatrick
3;20;12319;115;and, so believing, blazed forth in such ﬁres;kirkpatrick
3;20;12320;116;of love in truth that he, on second death,;kirkpatrick
3;20;12321;117;was ﬁt to make his way to this great game.;kirkpatrick
3;20;12322;118;The other, by that grace which drops like dew –;kirkpatrick
3;20;12323;119;its source so deep that no created eye;kirkpatrick
3;20;12324;120;can ever penetrate the primal wave –;kirkpatrick
3;20;12325;121;set all its love, down there, on righteousness.;kirkpatrick
3;20;12326;122;God, therefore, opened Ripheus’s eyes,;kirkpatrick
3;20;12327;123;grace upon grace, to when we’d be redeemed.;kirkpatrick
3;20;12328;124;In that redemption, he believed. And so;kirkpatrick
3;20;12329;125;he did not suﬀer any pagan stench,;kirkpatrick
3;20;12330;126;but stood as blunt reproof to those who strayed.;kirkpatrick
3;20;12331;127;Those three pure donne from the right-hand wheel;kirkpatrick
3;20;12332;128;which you saw once were his as baptism,;kirkpatrick
3;20;12333;129;a thousand years before baptizing came.;kirkpatrick
3;20;12334;130;Predestination! How remote your root;kirkpatrick
3;20;12335;131;from all those faces that, in looking up,;kirkpatrick
3;20;12336;132;cannot in toto see the primal cause!;kirkpatrick
3;20;12337;133;And so you mortals, in your judgements show;kirkpatrick
3;20;12338;134;restraint. For even we who look on God;kirkpatrick
3;20;12339;135;do not yet know who all the chosen are.;kirkpatrick
3;20;12340;136;Yet this deﬁciency for us is sweet.;kirkpatrick
3;20;12341;137;For in this good our own good ﬁnds its goal,;kirkpatrick
3;20;12342;138;that what God wills we likewise seek in will.’;kirkpatrick
3;20;12343;139;So from that sacred sign was given me,;kirkpatrick
3;20;12344;140;to bring to my short sight new clarity,;kirkpatrick
3;20;12345;141;a gentle draught of soothing medicine.;kirkpatrick
3;20;12346;142;As good guitarists with good singers make;kirkpatrick
3;20;12347;143;the string vibrate in answer to the beat,;kirkpatrick
3;20;12348;144;because of which the song gains more delight,;kirkpatrick
3;20;12349;145;so as it spoke, as I recall to mind,;kirkpatrick
3;20;12350;146;I saw the lights of those two blessed souls,;kirkpatrick
3;20;12351;147;concordant as the ﬂickering of our eyes,;kirkpatrick
3;20;12352;148;move at these words the bright sparks of their ﬂames.;kirkpatrick
3;21;12353;1;Now once again my eyes were ﬁxed upon;kirkpatrick
3;21;12354;2;my donna’ s countenance, and drawn away,;kirkpatrick
3;21;12355;3;with all my thoughts, from any other aim.;kirkpatrick
3;21;12356;4;She did not smile. But: ‘If I were to smile,’;kirkpatrick
3;21;12357;5;so she began, ‘you would become what once;kirkpatrick
3;21;12358;6;Semele was, when she was turned to ash.;kirkpatrick
3;21;12359;7;For if my beauty (which, as you have seen,;kirkpatrick
3;21;12360;8;burns yet more brightly as it climbs the stair;kirkpatrick
3;21;12361;9;that carries us through this eternal hall);kirkpatrick
3;21;12362;10;were not now tempered, it would shine so clear;kirkpatrick
3;21;12363;11;that all within your mortal power would be;kirkpatrick
3;21;12364;12;a sprig, as this ﬂash struck, shaken by thunder.;kirkpatrick
3;21;12365;13;We’re lifted to the seventh splendour now,;kirkpatrick
3;21;12366;14;which here, beneath the ﬁery Lion’s breast,;kirkpatrick
3;21;12367;15;combines its rays, in brave strength, with that sign.;kirkpatrick
3;21;12368;16;Fix your mind ﬁrm behind those eyes of yours,;kirkpatrick
3;21;12369;17;and make them both a mirror for the form;kirkpatrick
3;21;12370;18;that in this mirror will appear to you.’;kirkpatrick
3;21;12371;19;Whoever knows the pasture, for themselves,;kirkpatrick
3;21;12372;20;that my eyes grazed on in that blessed sight,;kirkpatrick
3;21;12373;21;when once I’d altered to that other care,;kirkpatrick
3;21;12374;22;will recognize the pleasure that I took;kirkpatrick
3;21;12375;23;in bowing down to that celestial guide,;kirkpatrick
3;21;12376;24;weighing consent against the sight of her.;kirkpatrick
3;21;12377;25;Within the crystal, circling round the world,;kirkpatrick
3;21;12378;26;which bears the etymon of that dear lord –;kirkpatrick
3;21;12379;27;under whose sway all evil thoughts lie dead,;kirkpatrick
3;21;12380;28;I saw, as gold in which a ray shines through,;kirkpatrick
3;21;12381;29;a ladder stretching upwards – and so far –;kirkpatrick
3;21;12382;30;my eye-lights could not follow where it led.;kirkpatrick
3;21;12383;31;I also saw descending, rung by rung,;kirkpatrick
3;21;12384;32;so many brilliancies that every ﬂare;kirkpatrick
3;21;12385;33;the sky displays I thought was ﬂowing down.;kirkpatrick
3;21;12386;34;Compare: by instinct, as the day ﬁrst breaks,;kirkpatrick
3;21;12387;35;jackdaws will ﬂock and stir their wings as one;kirkpatrick
3;21;12388;36;to bring some warmth once more to icy plumes.;kirkpatrick
3;21;12389;37;Then some will make away and not return,;kirkpatrick
3;21;12390;38;while others do go back from where they’d come,;kirkpatrick
3;21;12391;39;and some will stay and wheel round that same spot.;kirkpatrick
3;21;12392;40;In just that way, these sparks appeared to me,;kirkpatrick
3;21;12393;41;combining in their scintillating showers;kirkpatrick
3;21;12394;42;as each one struck upon a certain step.;kirkpatrick
3;21;12395;43;The light, then, tightest at our side, shone out;kirkpatrick
3;21;12396;44;so clear that, thinking to myself, I said:;kirkpatrick
3;21;12397;45;‘I see full well what love you show to me.;kirkpatrick
3;21;12398;46;But she from whom I wait to hear the “when”;kirkpatrick
3;21;12399;47;of silence and of speech, and “how”, stays still.;kirkpatrick
3;21;12400;48;Against my will, it’s well that I don’t ask.’;kirkpatrick
3;21;12401;49;So she who saw my silence in the sight;kirkpatrick
3;21;12402;50;of Him who sees the all of everything;kirkpatrick
3;21;12403;51;said now: ‘Unloose the knot of warm desire.’;kirkpatrick
3;21;12404;52;‘No merit I may claim,’ so I began,;kirkpatrick
3;21;12405;53;‘can make me ﬁt to hear what you will say.;kirkpatrick
3;21;12406;54;But, for the sake of her who lets me ask,;kirkpatrick
3;21;12407;55;make known to me, you happy living soul,;kirkpatrick
3;21;12408;56;hiding within the heart of your own joy,;kirkpatrick
3;21;12409;57;the reason you have set yourself so near me.;kirkpatrick
3;21;12410;58;And tell me why the symphony;kirkpatrick
3;21;12411;59;of Paradise, which sounds in sweet devotion;kirkpatrick
3;21;12412;60;through the other spheres, is muted in this wheel.’;kirkpatrick
3;21;12413;61;‘In hearing, you are mortal, as in sight.;kirkpatrick
3;21;12414;62;So, just as Beatrice does not smile,;kirkpatrick
3;21;12415;63;likewise,’ he answered me, ‘there’s no song here.;kirkpatrick
3;21;12416;64;I have descended down the holy stair;kirkpatrick
3;21;12417;65;as far as this to bring you only joy,;kirkpatrick
3;21;12418;66;with speech and with the light that mantles me.;kirkpatrick
3;21;12419;67;Nor does more love to you make me more quick.;kirkpatrick
3;21;12420;68;For that same love, and more, seethes upwards here;kirkpatrick
3;21;12421;69;as all this ﬂaming-out displays to you.;kirkpatrick
3;21;12422;70;But caritas on high that makes us serve;kirkpatrick
3;21;12423;71;so readily the wisdom of the spheres;kirkpatrick
3;21;12424;72;allots the places here as you observe.’;kirkpatrick
3;21;12425;73;‘I truly see,’ I said, ‘O sacred light,;kirkpatrick
3;21;12426;74;how love – the freedom of this holy court –;kirkpatrick
3;21;12427;75;is all one needs to trace God’s providence.;kirkpatrick
3;21;12428;76;But this, for me, seems hard to penetrate:;kirkpatrick
3;21;12429;77;why, among those who share your destiny,;kirkpatrick
3;21;12430;78;are you alone predestined to this task?’;kirkpatrick
3;21;12431;79;Nor had I reached the last of all these words;kirkpatrick
3;21;12432;80;when that light took its centre as a hub,;kirkpatrick
3;21;12433;81;spinning around itself as grindstones do.;kirkpatrick
3;21;12434;82;The love within it then replied to me:;kirkpatrick
3;21;12435;83;‘Divine light drives its point upon me here.;kirkpatrick
3;21;12436;84;And, penetrating that in which I’m wombed,;kirkpatrick
3;21;12437;85;its virtue, joined with my own powers of sight,;kirkpatrick
3;21;12438;86;lifts me so high above myself, I see;kirkpatrick
3;21;12439;87;on high the essence where that light is milked.;kirkpatrick
3;21;12440;88;Hence comes the brightening joy in which I ﬂame.;kirkpatrick
3;21;12441;89;Equal to what I see in clarity;kirkpatrick
3;21;12442;90;is this clear ﬂame that I myself display.;kirkpatrick
3;21;12443;91;But still the soul in Heaven that brightens most –;kirkpatrick
3;21;12444;92;that seraph with its eye ﬁxed most in God –;kirkpatrick
3;21;12445;93;could never satisfy your last demand.;kirkpatrick
3;21;12446;94;For what you ask so in-beyonds itself;kirkpatrick
3;21;12447;95;within the chasm of divine decree,;kirkpatrick
3;21;12448;96;it’s cut oﬀ wholly from a creature’s sight.;kirkpatrick
3;21;12449;97;And so when you return to mortal things,;kirkpatrick
3;21;12450;98;bear this with you, so none there may presume;kirkpatrick
3;21;12451;99;to move their feet to any suchlike aim.;kirkpatrick
3;21;12452;100;Minds that shine here, on earth give oﬀ mere smoke.;kirkpatrick
3;21;12453;101;So just consider whether those down there;kirkpatrick
3;21;12454;102;could do what, raised to Heaven, no mind can do.’;kirkpatrick
3;21;12455;103;His words so cut and limited my thoughts;kirkpatrick
3;21;12456;104;that I gave up the question, holding back,;kirkpatrick
3;21;12457;105;to ask him, very humbly, who he was.;kirkpatrick
3;21;12458;106;‘Between the littorals of Italy;kirkpatrick
3;21;12459;107;not far from your own fatherland, hard rocks;kirkpatrick
3;21;12460;108;surge up so high the thunder sounds beneath.;kirkpatrick
3;21;12461;109;These form a hunchback ridge called Catria.;kirkpatrick
3;21;12462;110;Below that lies a consecrated cell;kirkpatrick
3;21;12463;111;devoted, once, to God’s unending praise.’;kirkpatrick
3;21;12464;112;So he began for me his third address,;kirkpatrick
3;21;12465;113;and then, continuing: ‘Here I remained;kirkpatrick
3;21;12466;114;so steadfast in the service of our Lord –;kirkpatrick
3;21;12467;115;oil, simply, of the olive dressed my food –;kirkpatrick
3;21;12468;116;that I lived lightly through both heat and chill,;kirkpatrick
3;21;12469;117;contented with contemplative intent.;kirkpatrick
3;21;12470;118;That cloister once would render to the skies;kirkpatrick
3;21;12471;119;a fertile crop, but now – and this will soon;kirkpatrick
3;21;12472;120;be all revealed – is hollow, empty, vain.;kirkpatrick
3;21;12473;121;In that place, I was Peter Damian,;kirkpatrick
3;21;12474;122;and otherwise, within Our Lady’s house,;kirkpatrick
3;21;12475;123;Peter the Sinner on the Adriatic shore.;kirkpatrick
3;21;12476;124;Little, for me, of mortal life remained;kirkpatrick
3;21;12477;125;when I was called and forced to wear the gear;kirkpatrick
3;21;12478;126;that’s handed down, these days, from bad to worse.;kirkpatrick
3;21;12479;127;Once Cephas came – as did that vessel, too,;kirkpatrick
3;21;12480;128;of Holy Inspiration – shoeless, lean,;kirkpatrick
3;21;12481;129;taking their meals in any mere hotel.;kirkpatrick
3;21;12482;130;Our modern pastors, though, have put on weight.;kirkpatrick
3;21;12483;131;They need some propping up on either side,;kirkpatrick
3;21;12484;132;someone to hoist their backsides up, or lead.;kirkpatrick
3;21;12485;133;The robes they dress in cloak their steeds as well,;kirkpatrick
3;21;12486;134;so two beasts go within a single skin.;kirkpatrick
3;21;12487;135;What patience, God! to bear a sight like that.’;kirkpatrick
3;21;12488;136;I saw, as this was said, more little ﬂames,;kirkpatrick
3;21;12489;137;ascending and revolving, step by step,;kirkpatrick
3;21;12490;138;more beautiful at every turn they took.;kirkpatrick
3;21;12491;139;They came and circled round this soul, then stopped,;kirkpatrick
3;21;12492;140;and gave a cry so piercing in its sound;kirkpatrick
3;21;12493;141;that nothing here on earth could equal it.;kirkpatrick
3;21;12494;142;And, thunderstruck, I did not understand.;kirkpatrick
3;22;12495;1;Astounded, overwhelmed, I turned to her,;kirkpatrick
3;22;12496;2;my constant guide, like any little boy;kirkpatrick
3;22;12497;3;who’ll run to where his greatest trust is found.;kirkpatrick
3;22;12498;4;And rushing there, as mothers always do,;kirkpatrick
3;22;12499;5;with words to help and set once more to rights;kirkpatrick
3;22;12500;6;her shocked, pale, sobbing son, she said to me:;kirkpatrick
3;22;12501;7;‘Do you not know that you’re in Heaven now?;kirkpatrick
3;22;12502;8;Or know the heavens are holy everywhere,;kirkpatrick
3;22;12503;9;and all that here is done is done from zeal?;kirkpatrick
3;22;12504;10;Just think of this: how much that song and I,;kirkpatrick
3;22;12505;11;in smiling, would have wrought in you a change;kirkpatrick
3;22;12506;12;when you are so much moved by that great cry –;kirkpatrick
3;22;12507;13;in which, if you had understood their prayers,;kirkpatrick
3;22;12508;14;you might have heard the vengeance clearly sung;kirkpatrick
3;22;12509;15;that you will come to see before your death.;kirkpatrick
3;22;12510;16;That sword raised here will strike, though not in haste,;kirkpatrick
3;22;12511;17;nor yet too slow, save only in the view;kirkpatrick
3;22;12512;18;of those who wait in fear or keen desire.;kirkpatrick
3;22;12513;19;But now turn round to look on other souls.;kirkpatrick
3;22;12514;20;If, as I ask, you turn your face to these,;kirkpatrick
3;22;12515;21;you’ll see the shining honour of their hearts.’;kirkpatrick
3;22;12516;22;Once more, as she desired, I turned my eyes,;kirkpatrick
3;22;12517;23;and saw a hundred bright particular spheres;kirkpatrick
3;22;12518;24;that all grew lovelier in their mutual rays.;kirkpatrick
3;22;12519;25;So there I stood, like someone driving back;kirkpatrick
3;22;12520;26;the point of his desire within himself,;kirkpatrick
3;22;12521;27;not daring out of fear to question more.;kirkpatrick
3;22;12522;28;And now the fullest of those orient pearls,;kirkpatrick
3;22;12523;29;most brilliant in its lustre, made to come;kirkpatrick
3;22;12524;30;and make my will content with what it was.;kirkpatrick
3;22;12525;31;Within, I heard: ‘Were you to see, as I,;kirkpatrick
3;22;12526;32;the caritas that burns among us here,;kirkpatrick
3;22;12527;33;you would by now have pressed your thoughts to voice.;kirkpatrick
3;22;12528;34;But lest, in pausing, you too long defer;kirkpatrick
3;22;12529;35;the road to your high goal, I’ll make reply;kirkpatrick
3;22;12530;36;directly to your thought, since that’s your care.;kirkpatrick
3;22;12531;37;The mountain on whose sides Cassino is;kirkpatrick
3;22;12532;38;was thickly peopled round its summit once;kirkpatrick
3;22;12533;39;by tribes, deluded, of a stubborn strain.;kirkpatrick
3;22;12534;40;And I am he who bore ﬁrst to that height;kirkpatrick
3;22;12535;41;the name of Him who carried down to earth;kirkpatrick
3;22;12536;42;the truth that bears us to transcendent realms.;kirkpatrick
3;22;12537;43;And grace to that extent shone down on me;kirkpatrick
3;22;12538;44;that I retrieved the townships all around;kirkpatrick
3;22;12539;45;from false devotions that seduce the world.;kirkpatrick
3;22;12540;46;These other ﬁres were all contemplatives,;kirkpatrick
3;22;12541;47;men brightly kindled by the ardent warmth;kirkpatrick
3;22;12542;48;that brings to birth the holy ﬂowers and fruit.;kirkpatrick
3;22;12543;49;"Maccario is here; Romoaldo here.";kirkpatrick
3;22;12544;50;Here are my brothers, who within the cloister;kirkpatrick
3;22;12545;51;steadied their steps and kept their hearts entire.’;kirkpatrick
3;22;12546;52;And I to him: ‘The feeling you display;kirkpatrick
3;22;12547;53;in speaking thus to me, the looks;kirkpatrick
3;22;12548;54;I note so well-disposed in you, and all these ﬁres,  have;kirkpatrick
3;22;12549;55;caused in me my trust to open wide;kirkpatrick
3;22;12550;56;as sun does to the rose when this becomes;kirkpatrick
3;22;12551;57;as fully open as its power can be.;kirkpatrick
3;22;12552;58;Therefore I pray, do, Father, make me sure;kirkpatrick
3;22;12553;59;that I may come to take such grace that I;kirkpatrick
3;22;12554;60;might see your face, uncovered, as you are.’;kirkpatrick
3;22;12555;61;At which, he said: ‘Brother, your high desire;kirkpatrick
3;22;12556;62;will be fulﬁlled within the ﬁnal sphere,;kirkpatrick
3;22;12557;63;where all desires, as mine too, are fulﬁlled.;kirkpatrick
3;22;12558;64;All our desiring is perfected there,;kirkpatrick
3;22;12559;65;complete and fruitful in that sphere alone;kirkpatrick
3;22;12560;66;where every part is where all parts have been.;kirkpatrick
3;22;12561;67;For that is no mere place. It has no pole.;kirkpatrick
3;22;12562;68;Our ladder, rising, spans across to that,;kirkpatrick
3;22;12563;69;and therefore steals in ﬂight away from view.;kirkpatrick
3;22;12564;70;Up there, to where its highest part extends,;kirkpatrick
3;22;12565;71;the Patriarch beheld it all – Jacob;kirkpatrick
3;22;12566;72;who saw the angels loading all its length.;kirkpatrick
3;22;12567;73;But no one lifts their feet, now, from the earth;kirkpatrick
3;22;12568;74;to climb those rungs. My Rule remains a waste;kirkpatrick
3;22;12569;75;of all the vellum that it’s copied on.;kirkpatrick
3;22;12570;76;The walls that once encircled abbey grounds;kirkpatrick
3;22;12571;77;are turned to dens and lairs. Monastic cowls;kirkpatrick
3;22;12572;78;are bursting sacks stuﬀed full with rotten ﬂour.;kirkpatrick
3;22;12573;79;But even usury at its worst does not;kirkpatrick
3;22;12574;80;distract so much from all that God ﬁnds good;kirkpatrick
3;22;12575;81;as that fruit does, which maddens monks at heart.;kirkpatrick
3;22;12576;82;For everything the Church is there to guard;kirkpatrick
3;22;12577;83;belongs to those who ask it in God’s name.;kirkpatrick
3;22;12578;84;It is not meant for kinsmen – worse still, brutes.;kirkpatrick
3;22;12579;85;The ﬂesh of mortals runs to yielding ﬂab.;kirkpatrick
3;22;12580;86;So good beginnings aren’t enough to last;kirkpatrick
3;22;12581;87;to acorn time from when the oak is born.;kirkpatrick
3;22;12582;88;Peter began – no silver and no gold! –;kirkpatrick
3;22;12583;89;as I did, too, with fasting and with prayers.;kirkpatrick
3;22;12584;90;And Francis built his order on humility.;kirkpatrick
3;22;12585;91;But if you look where each of these began,;kirkpatrick
3;22;12586;92;and then consider where their track has run,;kirkpatrick
3;22;12587;93;you’ll see the white original turned dark.;kirkpatrick
3;22;12588;94;And yet, to see the Jordan turning back;kirkpatrick
3;22;12589;95;or, as God willed, the ocean ﬂee apart;kirkpatrick
3;22;12590;96;is more miraculous than God’s aid here.’;kirkpatrick
3;22;12591;97;All this he said, and then once more drew back;kirkpatrick
3;22;12592;98;to join his cell, and that cell tightened in.;kirkpatrick
3;22;12593;99;And then, as whirlwinds do, it spiralled up.;kirkpatrick
3;22;12594;100;My sweetest lady with a single sign –;kirkpatrick
3;22;12595;101;the powers she had so vanquished what I was –;kirkpatrick
3;22;12596;102;drove me to mount the ladder after them.;kirkpatrick
3;22;12597;103;Nor where, in natural terms, we climb or sink;kirkpatrick
3;22;12598;104;is any motion ever swift enough;kirkpatrick
3;22;12599;105;to match the speed of what my wings could do.;kirkpatrick
3;22;12600;106;So may I, reader, sometime join once more;kirkpatrick
3;22;12601;107;that prayerful march of victory (for which;kirkpatrick
3;22;12602;108;I often weep my sins and beat my breast),;kirkpatrick
3;22;12603;109;you’d not so swiftly have withdrawn and thrust;kirkpatrick
3;22;12604;110;your ﬁnger in the ﬁre as I ﬁrst saw;kirkpatrick
3;22;12605;111;the sign that follows Taurus…and was in!;kirkpatrick
3;22;12606;112;You stars in glory! Light enwombing here;kirkpatrick
3;22;12607;113;those virtuous powers from which, I recognize,;kirkpatrick
3;22;12608;114;whatever talents that are mine derive,;kirkpatrick
3;22;12609;115;with you, the father of all mortal life;kirkpatrick
3;22;12610;116;was born, conjoined, then hidden in your span,;kirkpatrick
3;22;12611;117;when ﬁrst I felt the bite of Tuscan air.;kirkpatrick
3;22;12612;118;And then when, free and wide, grace granted me;kirkpatrick
3;22;12613;119;high entry to the wheel that turns your sphere,;kirkpatrick
3;22;12614;120;yours was the region here allotted me.;kirkpatrick
3;22;12615;121;My soul in all devotion breathes to you,;kirkpatrick
3;22;12616;122;seeking from you the virtue and the strength;kirkpatrick
3;22;12617;123;to meet the test the heavens now draw it to.;kirkpatrick
3;22;12618;124;‘You are so close,’ so Beatrice said,;kirkpatrick
3;22;12619;125;‘to your salvation here that you must keep;kirkpatrick
3;22;12620;126;the light within your eye acute and clear.;kirkpatrick
3;22;12621;127;And so, before you further “in” yourself,;kirkpatrick
3;22;12622;128;look down and wonder at how great a world;kirkpatrick
3;22;12623;129;already you have set beneath your feet,;kirkpatrick
3;22;12624;130;so that your heart may show itself, as full;kirkpatrick
3;22;12625;131;as it may be, to this triumphant throng;kirkpatrick
3;22;12626;132;that rings in happiness the ethereal round.’;kirkpatrick
3;22;12627;133;I turned about to look once more through all;kirkpatrick
3;22;12628;134;the seven spheres and, seeing there the globe,;kirkpatrick
3;22;12629;135;I smiled to ﬁnd how small and cheap it seemed.;kirkpatrick
3;22;12630;136;I thoroughly approve as best the thought;kirkpatrick
3;22;12631;137;that earth is least. Those, then, who set their minds on;kirkpatrick
3;22;12632;138;other things are known as right and able.;kirkpatrick
3;22;12633;139;I saw, on ﬁre, the daughter of Latona,;kirkpatrick
3;22;12634;140;free of the shadow that had made me once;kirkpatrick
3;22;12635;141;believe the moon to be both rare and dense.;kirkpatrick
3;22;12636;142;I now could bear, Hyperion, the look;kirkpatrick
3;22;12637;143;of your bright son. I saw there movements, too –;kirkpatrick
3;22;12638;144;Dione, Maia – that were circling near.;kirkpatrick
3;22;12639;145;And there, between his sire and son, appeared;kirkpatrick
3;22;12640;146;the tempering inﬂuence of Jupiter;kirkpatrick
3;22;12641;147;and, clear to view, the varying ‘where’ of each.;kirkpatrick
3;22;12642;148;And all these seven spheres displayed to me;kirkpatrick
3;22;12643;149;their magnitude, their speed, the distance, too,;kirkpatrick
3;22;12644;150;that lay between the dwelling place of each.;kirkpatrick
3;22;12645;151;That little threshing ﬂoor that makes men ﬁerce,;kirkpatrick
3;22;12646;152;myself now turning with the eternal Twins,;kirkpatrick
3;22;12647;153;was seen entire – to river-mouths from hills.;kirkpatrick
3;22;12648;154;My eyes I then turned back to her ﬁne eyes.;kirkpatrick
3;23;12649;1;Compare: a bird, among her well-loved boughs,;kirkpatrick
3;23;12650;2;has rested all night long while things lie hid,;kirkpatrick
3;23;12651;3;"poised where her dear brood sleeps within their nest;";kirkpatrick
3;23;12652;4;and then, to glimpse the looks she’s longed to see,;kirkpatrick
3;23;12653;5;and ﬁnd the food her ﬂedglings feed upon;kirkpatrick
3;23;12654;6;(these eﬀorts weigh with her as pure delight);kirkpatrick
3;23;12655;7;before dawn comes she mounts an open sprig,;kirkpatrick
3;23;12656;8;and there, her heart ablaze, awaits the sun,;kirkpatrick
3;23;12657;9;eyes sharpening, ﬁxed, till day is truly born.;kirkpatrick
3;23;12658;10;So, too, head raised, tall, straight, my donna stood,;kirkpatrick
3;23;12659;11;attention wholly on that stretch of sky;kirkpatrick
3;23;12660;12;where, under noon, the sun displays least speed.;kirkpatrick
3;23;12661;13;And I, to see her stand enraptured so,;kirkpatrick
3;23;12662;14;became like one desiring still what he;kirkpatrick
3;23;12663;15;has not – and yet in hope is satisﬁed.;kirkpatrick
3;23;12664;16;But little time went by between these two –;kirkpatrick
3;23;12665;17;I mean my waiting, and my seeing now;kirkpatrick
3;23;12666;18;the skies that, brightening still, grew yet more bright.;kirkpatrick
3;23;12667;19;And ‘Look!’ said Beatrice. ‘Triumphing,;kirkpatrick
3;23;12668;20;the soldiery of Christ, and all the yield,;kirkpatrick
3;23;12669;21;brought from the orbit of the farthest spheres!’;kirkpatrick
3;23;12670;22;Her face, it seemed to me, now burned so bright,;kirkpatrick
3;23;12671;23;her eyes so ﬁlled with utmost happiness,;kirkpatrick
3;23;12672;24;that I must needs pass on and frame no word.;kirkpatrick
3;23;12673;25;As in the calm, clear skies of moonlit nights,;kirkpatrick
3;23;12674;26;tri-form Diana smiles (eternal nymphs,;kirkpatrick
3;23;12675;27;around her, paint all Heaven’s curving spheres),;kirkpatrick
3;23;12676;28;above a thousand lanterns or still more,;kirkpatrick
3;23;12677;29;I saw one sun that, soaring, lit them all,;kirkpatrick
3;23;12678;30;as our sun lights the stars seen over us.;kirkpatrick
3;23;12679;31;And through this clear and living light there shone;kirkpatrick
3;23;12680;32;the being that creates that glow, too bright;kirkpatrick
3;23;12681;33;within my eyes for me to tolerate.;kirkpatrick
3;23;12682;34;My sweetness! Beatrice, guiding me!;kirkpatrick
3;23;12683;35;She spoke: ‘This power that overcomes your sight;kirkpatrick
3;23;12684;36;is one from which no shelter can be sought.;kirkpatrick
3;23;12685;37;Here is all wisdom, and the strength that cleared;kirkpatrick
3;23;12686;38;the open road that runs from Heaven to earth,;kirkpatrick
3;23;12687;39;for which so long was once such deep desire.’;kirkpatrick
3;23;12688;40;As bolts of ﬁre, unlocked from thunder clouds,;kirkpatrick
3;23;12689;41;expand beyond containment in those bounds,;kirkpatrick
3;23;12690;42;then fall to ground (as ﬁre, by nature, can’t),;kirkpatrick
3;23;12691;43;so, too, surrounded by this solemn feast,;kirkpatrick
3;23;12692;44;my own mind, grown the greater now, went forth;kirkpatrick
3;23;12693;45;and can’t remember what it then became.;kirkpatrick
3;23;12694;46;‘Open your eyes and look at what I am!;kirkpatrick
3;23;12695;47;You have seen things by which you’re made so strong, you;kirkpatrick
3;23;12696;48;can, now, bear to look upon my smile.’;kirkpatrick
3;23;12697;49;I was like one whose waking sense returns;kirkpatrick
3;23;12698;50;yet strives in vain – his dreaming now oblivion –;kirkpatrick
3;23;12699;51;to bring once more that vision back to mind,;kirkpatrick
3;23;12700;52;as I now heard that utterance which deserves;kirkpatrick
3;23;12701;53;a gratitude that never should be dimmed;kirkpatrick
3;23;12702;54;from that great book that tells of things long past.;kirkpatrick
3;23;12703;55;Even if all those voices were to sound;kirkpatrick
3;23;12704;56;that Polyhymnia and her sister muses;kirkpatrick
3;23;12705;57;fed on their sweetest milk so richly once,;kirkpatrick
3;23;12706;58;and aid me, singing of that holy smile;kirkpatrick
3;23;12707;59;and how her holy look grew purer still,;kirkpatrick
3;23;12708;60;I’d still not reach one thousandth of the truth.;kirkpatrick
3;23;12709;61;And so, imagining this Paradise,;kirkpatrick
3;23;12710;62;the sacred epic has to make a leap,;kirkpatrick
3;23;12711;63;as when we ﬁnd the road ahead cut oﬀ.;kirkpatrick
3;23;12712;64;Yet no one if they’ve gauged that weighty theme –;kirkpatrick
3;23;12713;65;and seen what mortal shoulders bear the load –;kirkpatrick
3;23;12714;66;would criticize such trembling backing-out.;kirkpatrick
3;23;12715;67;The waves that my adventurous prow here cleaves;kirkpatrick
3;23;12716;68;are no mere sea-loch that some skiﬀ might cross,;kirkpatrick
3;23;12717;69;or helmsmen lacking in the proper skill.;kirkpatrick
3;23;12718;70;‘Why is it that my face in-loves you so;kirkpatrick
3;23;12719;71;that you don’t turn to see the garden where,;kirkpatrick
3;23;12720;72;beneath Christ’s rays, such beauty is en-ﬂowered?;kirkpatrick
3;23;12721;73;The rose in which the Word of God became;kirkpatrick
3;23;12722;74;our ﬂesh is here. And here those ﬂeurs-de-lys;kirkpatrick
3;23;12723;75;whose perfume marks the path we rightly tread.’;kirkpatrick
3;23;12724;76;So, Beatrice. And I, quick to read;kirkpatrick
3;23;12725;77;whatever she might counsel, gave myself;kirkpatrick
3;23;12726;78;to battle, feeble though my eyelids were.;kirkpatrick
3;23;12727;79;My eyes have seen at times – though wrapped in shade –;kirkpatrick
3;23;12728;80;a ray of limpid sunlight, ﬁltering;kirkpatrick
3;23;12729;81;through broken cloud, across a ﬁeld of ﬂowers.;kirkpatrick
3;23;12730;82;So here I saw a swirling crowd of splendours;kirkpatrick
3;23;12731;83;ﬂung out like thunderbolts down burning beams,;kirkpatrick
3;23;12732;84;and could not see from where these ﬂashes came.;kirkpatrick
3;23;12733;85;You, Generous Strength! You leave your imprint here.;kirkpatrick
3;23;12734;86;To open this arena to my eyes (powerless;kirkpatrick
3;23;12735;87;to see You otherwise) You rose on high.;kirkpatrick
3;23;12736;88;The naming of that lovely ﬂower which I,;kirkpatrick
3;23;12737;89;at dawn and evening, call upon, compelled;kirkpatrick
3;23;12738;90;my mind to face in full the greatest ﬁre.;kirkpatrick
3;23;12739;91;And as my eyes, together, now portrayed;kirkpatrick
3;23;12740;92;the scope and nature of that bright, live star,;kirkpatrick
3;23;12741;93;victorious there, victorious here below,;kirkpatrick
3;23;12742;94;straight through the skies another torch came down;kirkpatrick
3;23;12743;95;spun in a circle, as a crown might be,;kirkpatrick
3;23;12744;96;and formed a ring around her, turning there.;kirkpatrick
3;23;12745;97;The sweetest melody that sounds on earth,;kirkpatrick
3;23;12746;98;or that which most attracts the soul to it,;kirkpatrick
3;23;12747;99;would seem like cloud ripped wide by thunder claps;kirkpatrick
3;23;12748;100;when heard beside the sounding of that lyre;kirkpatrick
3;23;12749;101;whose notes now crowned the lovely sapphire-stone,;kirkpatrick
3;23;12750;102;through whom the skies en-sapphire clearer still.;kirkpatrick
3;23;12751;103;‘I am the angel-love called Gabriel,;kirkpatrick
3;23;12752;104;encircling here the height of joy that breathes;kirkpatrick
3;23;12753;105;around the womb our Longed-for sheltered in.;kirkpatrick
3;23;12754;106;Lady of Heaven, I shall spin these turns;kirkpatrick
3;23;12755;107;till, in procession, you, behind your son,;kirkpatrick
3;23;12756;108;make the High Sphere, on entering, more divine.’;kirkpatrick
3;23;12757;109;And so the perfect circling of that tune;kirkpatrick
3;23;12758;110;sealed its conclusion, while the other lights;kirkpatrick
3;23;12759;111;rang out the sound of Maria’s name.;kirkpatrick
3;23;12760;112;The regal surcoat of those rolling spheres;kirkpatrick
3;23;12761;113;that form our universe, alive with stars,;kirkpatrick
3;23;12762;114;all shimmering at the breathing of God’s rule;kirkpatrick
3;23;12763;115;now stretched its inner shore so far above;kirkpatrick
3;23;12764;116;that nothing of it showed from where I was,;kirkpatrick
3;23;12765;117;no glimpse of that First Mover came to view.;kirkpatrick
3;23;12766;118;Therefore my eyes could not command the power;kirkpatrick
3;23;12767;119;to follow as that ﬂame, within its crown,;kirkpatrick
3;23;12768;120;rose up so close behind the seed she’d borne.;kirkpatrick
3;23;12769;121;A baby, suckling, once it’s full of milk,;kirkpatrick
3;23;12770;122;will hold its arms out wide towards its mum;kirkpatrick
3;23;12771;123;to make known outwardly its inner ﬂame.;kirkpatrick
3;23;12772;124;So, at their incandescent peaks, these gleams;kirkpatrick
3;23;12773;125;stretched up. And this, to me, made clear what depths of;kirkpatrick
3;23;12774;126;heartfelt love they bore towards Maria.;kirkpatrick
3;23;12775;127;But all remained there, still within my sight,;kirkpatrick
3;23;12776;128;singing in such sweet tones ‘Regina coeli’;kirkpatrick
3;23;12777;129;delight at that will never leave my heart.;kirkpatrick
3;23;12778;130;What richness, what abundance now well-stored;kirkpatrick
3;23;12779;131;within such overﬂowing barns – which were;kirkpatrick
3;23;12780;132;good husbandmen who sowed the seed below.;kirkpatrick
3;23;12781;133;Here life is lived rejoicing in that hoard,;kirkpatrick
3;23;12782;134;gained ever weeping in the exile years;kirkpatrick
3;23;12783;135;of Babylon, when gold was put aside.;kirkpatrick
3;23;12784;136;And here beneath the most exalted Son;kirkpatrick
3;23;12785;137;of God and Mary, in His victory,;kirkpatrick
3;23;12786;138;with all the new and all the ancient court,;kirkpatrick
3;24;12787;1;‘You chosen confrères of the Blessèd Lamb;kirkpatrick
3;24;12788;2;who feeds you at his solemn feast so well;kirkpatrick
3;24;12789;3;that you are full in all you wish and will,;kirkpatrick
3;24;12790;4;if this man here should taste, by grace of God,;kirkpatrick
3;24;12791;5;the crumbs and morsels falling from your board;kirkpatrick
3;24;12792;6;before his death prescribes for him due time,;kirkpatrick
3;24;12793;7;direct your mind to his unmeasured zeal.;kirkpatrick
3;24;12794;8;Let dew refresh him for a while. You drink;kirkpatrick
3;24;12795;9;that spring for ever where his thought derives.’;kirkpatrick
3;24;12796;10;Thus Beatrice. And those happy souls;kirkpatrick
3;24;12797;11;became like spheres revolving round ﬁxed points,;kirkpatrick
3;24;12798;12;ﬂaming in spinning turns as comets do.;kirkpatrick
3;24;12799;13;The well-tuned wheels of gold chronometers;kirkpatrick
3;24;12800;14;will seem (to those who check) to whirl in gear,;kirkpatrick
3;24;12801;15;the ﬁrst cog steady and the last in ﬂight.;kirkpatrick
3;24;12802;16;So, too, with all their measures swirling diﬀerently,;kirkpatrick
3;24;12803;17;they, dancing, let me estimate;kirkpatrick
3;24;12804;18;the riches – slow or rapid – each possessed.;kirkpatrick
3;24;12805;19;Then, from the one I’d marked of dearer worth,;kirkpatrick
3;24;12806;20;I saw a ﬁre ﬂare out with so much joy;kirkpatrick
3;24;12807;21;that none now left behind it was so clear.;kirkpatrick
3;24;12808;22;Three times it circled Beatrice round,;kirkpatrick
3;24;12809;23;the song it sang too deeply divinized;kirkpatrick
3;24;12810;24;for my imagination to recount.;kirkpatrick
3;24;12811;25;And so my pen will leap, and I’ll not write.;kirkpatrick
3;24;12812;26;Such pictures as we form – and words, of course –;kirkpatrick
3;24;12813;27;are far too garish for those subtle pleats.;kirkpatrick
3;24;12814;28;‘My holy sister. You have prayed for this;kirkpatrick
3;24;12815;29;with such devotion and such ardent prayers;kirkpatrick
3;24;12816;30;that you unloose me from that lovely sphere.’;kirkpatrick
3;24;12817;31;Then, when that blessèd ﬁre had come to rest,;kirkpatrick
3;24;12818;32;it breathed directly to my lady there;kirkpatrick
3;24;12819;33;in words of ﬁre, as I have spoken them.;kirkpatrick
3;24;12820;34;And she: ‘Eternal light of that great man;kirkpatrick
3;24;12821;35;to whom Our Lord bequeathed the keys (which He;kirkpatrick
3;24;12822;36;ﬁrst bore below) of this high jubilation,;kirkpatrick
3;24;12823;37;try him, as you may please, on any point –;kirkpatrick
3;24;12824;38;weighty or light – in matters of that Faith;kirkpatrick
3;24;12825;39;by which you came to walk across the sea.;kirkpatrick
3;24;12826;40;Whether he loves, believes and has good hope,;kirkpatrick
3;24;12827;41;cannot be secret. For your eyes here turn;kirkpatrick
3;24;12828;42;where all things are depicted, clear to see.;kirkpatrick
3;24;12829;43;But since this realm has gained its citizens;kirkpatrick
3;24;12830;44;through one true faith, it’s good that he should come and;kirkpatrick
3;24;12831;45;speak of that, to glorify its name.’;kirkpatrick
3;24;12832;46;Compare: at vivas students hold their ﬁre;kirkpatrick
3;24;12833;47;until, to test and not conclude the proof,;kirkpatrick
3;24;12834;48;professors lay their questions out to them.;kirkpatrick
3;24;12835;49;So I, while she was speaking, armed myself;kirkpatrick
3;24;12836;50;with every argument, to be prepared;kirkpatrick
3;24;12837;51;for questions, and professions of my own.;kirkpatrick
3;24;12838;52;‘Tell me, good Christian (and make clear you are ):;kirkpatrick
3;24;12839;53;what is this faith?’ At which, towards the light;kirkpatrick
3;24;12840;54;from which he breathed these words, I raised my brow,;kirkpatrick
3;24;12841;55;then turned to Beatrice. Quick in glance,;kirkpatrick
3;24;12842;56;she urged me, from my deepest inward source,;kirkpatrick
3;24;12843;57;that I should pour these spreading waters out.;kirkpatrick
3;24;12844;58;‘Let grace, which grants that I confess my faith;kirkpatrick
3;24;12845;59;to you, the noblest of centurions,;kirkpatrick
3;24;12846;60;make,’ I began, ‘my thoughts be well expressed.’;kirkpatrick
3;24;12847;61;And next: ‘As written by the truthful pen,;kirkpatrick
3;24;12848;62;Father, of your dear brother Paul, who set,;kirkpatrick
3;24;12849;63;with you, great Rome upon its rightful track:;kirkpatrick
3;24;12850;64;“Faith is substantial to the things we hope,;kirkpatrick
3;24;12851;65;the evidence of things we do not see.”;kirkpatrick
3;24;12852;66;And such, in essence, I believe it is.’;kirkpatrick
3;24;12853;67;And then I heard: ‘You understand aright –;kirkpatrick
3;24;12854;68;so long as you can tell why he classed faith;kirkpatrick
3;24;12855;69;as “substance” ﬁrst, and then as “evidence”.’;kirkpatrick
3;24;12856;70;I followed on: ‘All those deep mysteries;kirkpatrick
3;24;12857;71;which here so freely show themselves to me;kirkpatrick
3;24;12858;72;are, to the eyes of those down there well hid,;kirkpatrick
3;24;12859;73;so what they are lies wholly in belief,;kirkpatrick
3;24;12860;74;on which is posited the highest hope.;kirkpatrick
3;24;12861;75;Faith, for that reason, falls in substance class.;kirkpatrick
3;24;12862;76;And we are bound to form, from that belief –;kirkpatrick
3;24;12863;77;with nothing seen beyond – sound arguments.;kirkpatrick
3;24;12864;78;It’s therefore classed as evidence as well.’;kirkpatrick
3;24;12865;79;And now I heard: ‘If everything down there,;kirkpatrick
3;24;12866;80;wrung out of doctrine, were so understood,;kirkpatrick
3;24;12867;81;there’d be no room for showy sophistries.’;kirkpatrick
3;24;12868;82;This breathed from that enkindled love. And then,;kirkpatrick
3;24;12869;83;‘In alloy,’ he went on, ‘and legal weight,;kirkpatrick
3;24;12870;84;the coin you produce has passed assay.;kirkpatrick
3;24;12871;85;But tell me, have you got it in your purse?’;kirkpatrick
3;24;12872;86;At which, ‘I have!’ I said. ‘Yes! Round and bright.;kirkpatrick
3;24;12873;87;Nothing in how it’s minted p’rhapses me.’;kirkpatrick
3;24;12874;88;And then came ﬂowing from that deepest light;kirkpatrick
3;24;12875;89;which there shone out: ‘That precious gem of joy;kirkpatrick
3;24;12876;90;in which all other virtues ﬁnd their ground –;kirkpatrick
3;24;12877;91;whence does that come to you?’ And I: ‘The rain;kirkpatrick
3;24;12878;92;(so generous!) of the Holy Ghost that ﬂows;kirkpatrick
3;24;12879;93;between the leathered texts, both old and new,;kirkpatrick
3;24;12880;94;in logic is, I think, conclusively;kirkpatrick
3;24;12881;95;so sharp a proof that, when compared with that,;kirkpatrick
3;24;12882;96;all formal arguments appear obtuse.’;kirkpatrick
3;24;12883;97;I heard then: ‘All these premises, both old;kirkpatrick
3;24;12884;98;and new, that bring you to conclude this, why;kirkpatrick
3;24;12885;99;are these, you think, the light of holy tongues?’;kirkpatrick
3;24;12886;100;And I: ‘The proof, for me, that unlocks truth;kirkpatrick
3;24;12887;101;is found in deeds that followed from that faith.;kirkpatrick
3;24;12888;102;Nature can’t heat or hammer steel like that.’;kirkpatrick
3;24;12889;103;‘But say,’ came this riposte, ‘who gave to you;kirkpatrick
3;24;12890;104;assurance of these deeds? That very Book;kirkpatrick
3;24;12891;105;asserted this which still, itself, needs proof.’;kirkpatrick
3;24;12892;106;‘Suppose the world had turned to Christian faith;kirkpatrick
3;24;12893;107;without these miracles,’ I said, ‘then that;kirkpatrick
3;24;12894;108;would be a hundred times the miracle.;kirkpatrick
3;24;12895;109;For you were poor and needy in the ﬁeld,;kirkpatrick
3;24;12896;110;when you went out to sow this fertile crop.;kirkpatrick
3;24;12897;111;Once there were vines where now are only thorns.’;kirkpatrick
3;24;12898;112;When this was done, the holy court on high;kirkpatrick
3;24;12899;113;echoed through all the spheres its ‘God be praised!’;kirkpatrick
3;24;12900;114;sung to the melodies they sing up there.;kirkpatrick
3;24;12901;115;That lord who, in examining my work,;kirkpatrick
3;24;12902;116;had drawn me out, then onward branch to branch;kirkpatrick
3;24;12903;117;(so that we now drew near the last, fresh leaves);kirkpatrick
3;24;12904;118;once more began: ‘The play of grace that woos;kirkpatrick
3;24;12905;119;your mind has opened up, till now, your lips;kirkpatrick
3;24;12906;120;exactly as it’s right to open them.;kirkpatrick
3;24;12907;121;So, what emerged I seal and certify.;kirkpatrick
3;24;12908;122;But now you need to say what you believe,;kirkpatrick
3;24;12909;123;and say what source ﬁrst gave this faith to you.’;kirkpatrick
3;24;12910;124;‘Most Holy Father, Spirit who now sees;kirkpatrick
3;24;12911;125;what once you so believed that you outdid;kirkpatrick
3;24;12912;126;the younger feet that ran towards the grave’;kirkpatrick
3;24;12913;127;(thus I began) ‘you’d have me now make plain;kirkpatrick
3;24;12914;128;the formal essence of my ready faith,;kirkpatrick
3;24;12915;129;seeking as well its rationale and cause.;kirkpatrick
3;24;12916;130;I answer: I believe in one true God,;kirkpatrick
3;24;12917;131;sole and eternal who, Himself not moved,;kirkpatrick
3;24;12918;132;moves all the spheres by love and with desire.;kirkpatrick
3;24;12919;133;For this belief I have – beside those proofs;kirkpatrick
3;24;12920;134;that physics gives, and metaphysics, too –;kirkpatrick
3;24;12921;135;the truth that comes to me, as rain from here,;kirkpatrick
3;24;12922;136;through Moses, through the prophets and the psalms,;kirkpatrick
3;24;12923;137;through Gospel writings and the words you wrote;kirkpatrick
3;24;12924;138;when once the ardent Spirit raised you high.;kirkpatrick
3;24;12925;139;And I believe in three eternal persons,;kirkpatrick
3;24;12926;140;believing these one substance, one and three,;kirkpatrick
3;24;12927;141;to whom, grammatically, apply both “is” and “are”.;kirkpatrick
3;24;12928;142;This deep condition of divinity,;kirkpatrick
3;24;12929;143;which I here note, is many times impressed;kirkpatrick
3;24;12930;144;by Gospel teachings on my intellect.;kirkpatrick
3;24;12931;145;This doctrine is the origin, the spark;kirkpatrick
3;24;12932;146;that spreads to light the living ﬂame,;kirkpatrick
3;24;12933;147;which ﬂashes out in me as stars in heaven.’;kirkpatrick
3;24;12934;148;Like some great man, who, pleased with what he hears,;kirkpatrick
3;24;12935;149;rejoicing at his servant’s news, will ﬂing;kirkpatrick
3;24;12936;150;his arms, as silence falls, around his neck,;kirkpatrick
3;24;12937;151;so, singing as its blessings fell on me,;kirkpatrick
3;24;12938;152;three times – my words now mute – it circled me,;kirkpatrick
3;24;12939;153;the light of that apostle at whose will;kirkpatrick
3;24;12940;154;I’d spoken thus, the speech had pleased it so.;kirkpatrick
3;25;12941;1;If ever it should happen that this sacred work,;kirkpatrick
3;25;12942;2;to which both Earth and Heaven have set their hands,;kirkpatrick
3;25;12943;3;(making me over many years grow gaunt);kirkpatrick
3;25;12944;4;might overcome the cruelty that locks me out;kirkpatrick
3;25;12945;5;from where I slept, a lamb in that ﬁne fold,;kirkpatrick
3;25;12946;6;the enemy of wolves that war on it,;kirkpatrick
3;25;12947;7;with altered ﬂeece, with altered voice, I shall;kirkpatrick
3;25;12948;8;return as poet, taking, at my fount;kirkpatrick
3;25;12949;9;of baptism, the laurel for my crown.;kirkpatrick
3;25;12950;10;For I ﬁrst entered there within the faith;kirkpatrick
3;25;12951;11;that makes us known, in soul, to God, and then,;kirkpatrick
3;25;12952;12;for that same faith, Saint Peter ringed my brow.;kirkpatrick
3;25;12953;13;Towards us now there moved a light;kirkpatrick
3;25;12954;14;drawn from the sphere where that ﬁrst fruit of all the;kirkpatrick
3;25;12955;15;ministers of Christ had issued out.;kirkpatrick
3;25;12956;16;And, ﬁlled with happiness, my lady said:;kirkpatrick
3;25;12957;17;‘Look there! The wonder of it! Look! The Lord;kirkpatrick
3;25;12958;18;for whom the pilgrims travel to Galicia.’;kirkpatrick
3;25;12959;19;Compare: a dove will settle by its mate;kirkpatrick
3;25;12960;20;and, each to each, both turning, murmuring,;kirkpatrick
3;25;12961;21;make proclamation of the love they feel.;kirkpatrick
3;25;12962;22;So, too, I saw in glory each great prince;kirkpatrick
3;25;12963;23;made welcome, each by each, in that high realm,;kirkpatrick
3;25;12964;24;praising alike the feast at which they sat.;kirkpatrick
3;25;12965;25;But when their greetings reached their formal end,;kirkpatrick
3;25;12966;26;they stood in silence ﬁrmly coram me ,;kirkpatrick
3;25;12967;27;their sudden ﬁre defeating my turned eyes.;kirkpatrick
3;25;12968;28;And smiling, Beatrice now spoke out:;kirkpatrick
3;25;12969;29;‘You living excellence! Your written scrolls;kirkpatrick
3;25;12970;30;record the spacious giving of our hall.;kirkpatrick
3;25;12971;31;Make hope now echo in these generous heights.;kirkpatrick
3;25;12972;32;You well know how. Whenever Jesus graced;kirkpatrick
3;25;12973;33;his favoured three, you ﬁgured hope from that.’;kirkpatrick
3;25;12974;34;‘Raise your head high and gather conﬁdence.;kirkpatrick
3;25;12975;35;For all that rises from your mortal world;kirkpatrick
3;25;12976;36;will grow to ripeness in these rays of ours.’;kirkpatrick
3;25;12977;37;Such comfort reached me from the second ﬁre.;kirkpatrick
3;25;12978;38;I therefore raised my eyes towards the hills,;kirkpatrick
3;25;12979;39;which ﬁrst had bowed them down too heavily.;kirkpatrick
3;25;12980;40;‘Because our Emperor in grace desires;kirkpatrick
3;25;12981;41;that you, before your death, should come to greet;kirkpatrick
3;25;12982;42;his nobles in these secret audience rooms –;kirkpatrick
3;25;12983;43;so that, once truth is seen in this high court,;kirkpatrick
3;25;12984;44;the hope that stirs you in good love down there;kirkpatrick
3;25;12985;45;may gather strength in you and others, too –;kirkpatrick
3;25;12986;46;say what hope is, and how, within your mind,;kirkpatrick
3;25;12987;47;it comes to ﬂower, and how it came to you.’;kirkpatrick
3;25;12988;48;The second light, in this way, followed on.;kirkpatrick
3;25;12989;49;And she who guided, in all holiness,;kirkpatrick
3;25;12990;50;the pinions of my wings to ﬂy so high;kirkpatrick
3;25;12991;51;answered, before I could myself, with this:;kirkpatrick
3;25;12992;52;‘The Church, at war on earth, has not a child –;kirkpatrick
3;25;12993;53;and this is written in that Sun whose rays;kirkpatrick
3;25;12994;54;here shine upon our ranks – more full of hope.;kirkpatrick
3;25;12995;55;It has, therefore, been granted him to come,;kirkpatrick
3;25;12996;56;before his term of soldiership is through,;kirkpatrick
3;25;12997;57;from Egypt to behold Jerusalem.;kirkpatrick
3;25;12998;58;The next two points at which your questions strike –;kirkpatrick
3;25;12999;59;seeking not knowledge but that he report;kirkpatrick
3;25;13000;60;how greatly hope, as virtue, pleases you –;kirkpatrick
3;25;13001;61;I leave to him. These won’t prove diﬃcult,;kirkpatrick
3;25;13002;62;and yet won’t tempt him into mere display.;kirkpatrick
3;25;13003;63;Let him reply. May God’s grace bear him on.’;kirkpatrick
3;25;13004;64;A bright, keen student who has done his work;kirkpatrick
3;25;13005;65;is quick to answer to his lecturer’s hint,;kirkpatrick
3;25;13006;66;and thus disclose to her how good he is.;kirkpatrick
3;25;13007;67;‘Hope is sure expectation,’ I declared,;kirkpatrick
3;25;13008;68;‘of glory that will come. The grace of God;kirkpatrick
3;25;13009;69;and precedent good works produce this power.;kirkpatrick
3;25;13010;70;From many stars its light comes down to me.;kirkpatrick
3;25;13011;71;But David ﬁrst instilled it in my heart,;kirkpatrick
3;25;13012;72;that highest singer of the highest Lord.;kirkpatrick
3;25;13013;73;“Let those have hope in you who know His name.”;kirkpatrick
3;25;13014;74;So David, in his psalmody, sings out.;kirkpatrick
3;25;13015;75;And who cannot know that who shares my faith?;kirkpatrick
3;25;13016;76;Then you in your epistle – as with drops;kirkpatrick
3;25;13017;77;of dew – distilled my hopes. So I am full,;kirkpatrick
3;25;13018;78;and rain your cooling shower on other lives.’;kirkpatrick
3;25;13019;79;While I spoke on, within the living breast;kirkpatrick
3;25;13020;80;of that ﬁerce blaze, repeated tremors ﬂashed,;kirkpatrick
3;25;13021;81;as rapid as in any lightning storm.;kirkpatrick
3;25;13022;82;‘The love by which,’ it breathed, ‘I still am ﬁred;kirkpatrick
3;25;13023;83;towards that virtue which came with me till;kirkpatrick
3;25;13024;84;I won the martyr’s palm and left the ﬁeld,;kirkpatrick
3;25;13025;85;wills that, to you who take the same delight,;kirkpatrick
3;25;13026;86;I breathe once more. My pleasure is: you say;kirkpatrick
3;25;13027;87;what promises your hope has made to you.’;kirkpatrick
3;25;13028;88;And I: ‘The Scriptures, both the old and new,;kirkpatrick
3;25;13029;89;deﬁne and indicate that goal for me:;kirkpatrick
3;25;13030;90;the friendship God concludes with certain souls.;kirkpatrick
3;25;13031;91;Isaiah says that each, in his own land,;kirkpatrick
3;25;13032;92;will be arrayed in two-fold vestiture.;kirkpatrick
3;25;13033;93;And “his own land” is here, this sweetest life.;kirkpatrick
3;25;13034;94;And yet more fully your own brother makes;kirkpatrick
3;25;13035;95;this revelation clear to us. He speaks;kirkpatrick
3;25;13036;96;(in the Apocalypse) of pure white dress.’;kirkpatrick
3;25;13037;97;Then, ﬁrst, when once these words had reached their;kirkpatrick
3;25;13038;98;end,;kirkpatrick
3;25;13039;99;‘Sperent in te’ above us could be heard,;kirkpatrick
3;25;13040;100;and all the circling choirs replied to that.;kirkpatrick
3;25;13041;101;And then, amid them all, one light shone clear.;kirkpatrick
3;25;13042;102;(Were such a crystal held in star sign Crab,;kirkpatrick
3;25;13043;103;winter would have a month of sunlit day.);kirkpatrick
3;25;13044;104;Young girls will rise light-heartedly and go;kirkpatrick
3;25;13045;105;to join in dancing and (so far from shame);kirkpatrick
3;25;13046;106;intend an honour to the newly-wed.;kirkpatrick
3;25;13047;107;So I saw now that ever-clearer gleam;kirkpatrick
3;25;13048;108;approach the two who spun to their own notes;kirkpatrick
3;25;13049;109;in keeping with the ardour of their love.;kirkpatrick
3;25;13050;110;This set itself within the wheeling song.;kirkpatrick
3;25;13051;111;My lady kept her eyes ﬁxed ﬁrm on these,;kirkpatrick
3;25;13052;112;as silent as a bride, as motionless.;kirkpatrick
3;25;13053;113;‘He is the one who lay upon the breast;kirkpatrick
3;25;13054;114;of Christ, our Pelican. And he it was;kirkpatrick
3;25;13055;115;elected, at the Cross, for one great task.’;kirkpatrick
3;25;13056;116;My lady spoke, and yet she did not cease,;kirkpatrick
3;25;13057;117;before or after, to maintain her gaze;kirkpatrick
3;25;13058;118;where ﬁrst it was, attentively, so ﬁxed.;kirkpatrick
3;25;13059;119;Like someone peering, doing all he can,;kirkpatrick
3;25;13060;120;to see some moment of the sun’s eclipse,;kirkpatrick
3;25;13061;121;who, seeing, grows unseeing all the more,;kirkpatrick
3;25;13062;122;so I became, as this last ﬁre appeared,;kirkpatrick
3;25;13063;123;while words were said: ‘Why dazzle your strained eyes to;kirkpatrick
3;25;13064;124;see things in this place that cannot be?;kirkpatrick
3;25;13065;125;My body lies as earth in earth, and shall;kirkpatrick
3;25;13066;126;(as others shall) until our numbers mount;kirkpatrick
3;25;13067;127;to equal what’s eternally decreed.;kirkpatrick
3;25;13068;128;Two lights alone have risen in both robes –;kirkpatrick
3;25;13069;129;in soul and body – to this cloistered joy.;kirkpatrick
3;25;13070;130;You’ll carry word of this to your own tribe.’;kirkpatrick
3;25;13071;131;As this was said, the ﬂaming wheel grew still,;kirkpatrick
3;25;13072;132;as did the lovely mingling of those sounds;kirkpatrick
3;25;13073;133;that formed within that breathing three-in-one.;kirkpatrick
3;25;13074;134;(Compare: to put an end to strain or risk,;kirkpatrick
3;25;13075;135;oars that repeatedly had struck the waves;kirkpatrick
3;25;13076;136;all stop the moment that the whistle sounds.);kirkpatrick
3;25;13077;137;Ah! What great turmoil in my mind to turn,;kirkpatrick
3;25;13078;138;thinking to see where Beatrice was,;kirkpatrick
3;25;13079;139;and yet not see – although so near to her,;kirkpatrick
3;25;13080;140;despite my being in that happy sphere.;kirkpatrick
3;26;13081;1;As I stood wavering, all seeing gone,;kirkpatrick
3;26;13082;2;out of the ﬂashing ﬂame that quenched my sight;kirkpatrick
3;26;13083;3;a breathing stirred that won my whole attention,;kirkpatrick
3;26;13084;4;saying: ‘While you have yet to re-awaken;kirkpatrick
3;26;13085;5;the sense of sight that spent itself in me,;kirkpatrick
3;26;13086;6;it’s good that you, with words, should compensate.;kirkpatrick
3;26;13087;7;Begin, then. Say what point the soul of you;kirkpatrick
3;26;13088;8;is aiming at, and know, with reason, that your powers of;kirkpatrick
3;26;13089;9;sight, blurred and confused, are not extinct.;kirkpatrick
3;26;13090;10;The lady who now leads you through this godlike realm has, in the glance she gives to you,;kirkpatrick
3;26;13091;11;the power that lay in Ananias’ hand.’;kirkpatrick
3;26;13092;12;‘As now or later pleases her,’ I said,;kirkpatrick
3;26;13093;13;‘may healing fall upon these eyes – the gates;kirkpatrick
3;26;13094;14;through which she came with ﬁres I burn from still.;kirkpatrick
3;26;13095;15;In every text that Love reads out to me –;kirkpatrick
3;26;13096;16;voiced low or strong – the Alpha and Omega is;kirkpatrick
3;26;13097;17;the Good that brings content to all this court.’;kirkpatrick
3;26;13098;18;The voice that ﬁrst had freed me from my fear;kirkpatrick
3;26;13099;19;when that bedazzlement had struck my eyes;kirkpatrick
3;26;13100;20;now sharpened my concern to speak once more.;kirkpatrick
3;26;13101;21;It said to me: ‘You must, for certain, clear;kirkpatrick
3;26;13102;22;in thought a stricter path. You need to tell;kirkpatrick
3;26;13103;23;who is it aims your bow towards its mark.’;kirkpatrick
3;26;13104;24;And I: ‘By reasons in philosophy,;kirkpatrick
3;26;13105;25;as by those Scriptures that descend from here,;kirkpatrick
3;26;13106;26;Love, of necessity, is stamped in me.;kirkpatrick
3;26;13107;27;For good per se , once recognized as good,;kirkpatrick
3;26;13108;28;sets love on ﬁre – the ﬁercer still as love;kirkpatrick
3;26;13109;29;holds more of good within its proper self.;kirkpatrick
3;26;13110;30;Towards that essence, then (which holds such sway;kirkpatrick
3;26;13111;31;that any good that’s found beyond its reach;kirkpatrick
3;26;13112;32;is nothing save a beam of that one ray),;kirkpatrick
3;26;13113;33;the mind, in loving, will more rightly move;kirkpatrick
3;26;13114;34;than elsewhere – or those minds, at least, that see the;kirkpatrick
3;26;13115;35;truth on which this demonstration stands.;kirkpatrick
3;26;13116;36;To my own mind that truth is ﬁrst proclaimed;kirkpatrick
3;26;13117;37;by one who demonstrates the primal love;kirkpatrick
3;26;13118;38;of all the sempiternal forms of life.;kirkpatrick
3;26;13119;39;Proclaimed as well by our true Font and Rule,;kirkpatrick
3;26;13120;40;Who, speaking of Himself, to Moses said:;kirkpatrick
3;26;13121;41;“I shall indeed ensure you see all good.”;kirkpatrick
3;26;13122;42;Proclaimed, no less, by you in your ﬁrst lines –;kirkpatrick
3;26;13123;43;that trumpet call that shouted the arcane;kirkpatrick
3;26;13124;44;clearer than any fanfare down from here.’;kirkpatrick
3;26;13125;45;And then I heard: ‘Through human intellect,;kirkpatrick
3;26;13126;46;and through authorities well-tuned to thought,;kirkpatrick
3;26;13127;47;the highest of your loves looks up to God.;kirkpatrick
3;26;13128;48;But say, as well, what other ropes you feel;kirkpatrick
3;26;13129;49;that draw you to Him and so, too, sound forth;kirkpatrick
3;26;13130;50;how many teeth love’s cog wheel bites you with.’;kirkpatrick
3;26;13131;51;Nothing lay hidden in the holy mind;kirkpatrick
3;26;13132;52;of Christ’s great Eagle. And I saw at once;kirkpatrick
3;26;13133;53;where he meant my avowals to advance.;kirkpatrick
3;26;13134;54;So I began: ‘As many ratchet-teeth;kirkpatrick
3;26;13135;55;as ever turn the human heart to God,;kirkpatrick
3;26;13136;56;all run as one with my own charity.;kirkpatrick
3;26;13137;57;My being, and the being of the world,;kirkpatrick
3;26;13138;58;the death that He sustained so I might live,;kirkpatrick
3;26;13139;59;the hope that all, with me, confess in faith,;kirkpatrick
3;26;13140;60;the living knowledge I have spoken of –;kirkpatrick
3;26;13141;61;all drew me from the waves of wrongful love;kirkpatrick
3;26;13142;62;and set me on the shores of righteousness.;kirkpatrick
3;26;13143;63;And every leaf, en-leaﬁng all the grove;kirkpatrick
3;26;13144;64;of our eternal orchardist, I love;kirkpatrick
3;26;13145;65;as far as love is borne to them from Him.’;kirkpatrick
3;26;13146;66;As I fell silent, through the sky there rang;kirkpatrick
3;26;13147;67;the sweetest song – my lady and these souls;kirkpatrick
3;26;13148;68;all saying now the ‘Holy, Holy, Holy’.;kirkpatrick
3;26;13149;69;A piercing light will startle us from sleep –;kirkpatrick
3;26;13150;70;eye-pulses racing as they meet the glare;kirkpatrick
3;26;13151;71;that passes through the lens from skirt to skirt –  and,;kirkpatrick
3;26;13152;72;shocked awake, we muddle what we see,;kirkpatrick
3;26;13153;73;a blank, mere nescience, at this alert,;kirkpatrick
3;26;13154;74;until our faculties restore their aid.;kirkpatrick
3;26;13155;75;So, too, the eyes of Beatrice shone –;kirkpatrick
3;26;13156;76;their ray would reach a thousand miles or more –;kirkpatrick
3;26;13157;77;routing the maculae that tainted mine.;kirkpatrick
3;26;13158;78;I saw now better than I had before.;kirkpatrick
3;26;13159;79;And, all but stunned, I asked who that light was,;kirkpatrick
3;26;13160;80;appearing as the fourth amongst us there.;kirkpatrick
3;26;13161;81;My donna answered me: ‘Within those rays,;kirkpatrick
3;26;13162;82;the Maker looks with love upon the ﬁrst;kirkpatrick
3;26;13163;83;of souls that primal power had ever formed.’;kirkpatrick
3;26;13164;84;As fresh-leaved branches, when a breeze goes by,;kirkpatrick
3;26;13165;85;bend at their tip, and then – through inner strength which;kirkpatrick
3;26;13166;86;points them high – will straighten once again,  so I;kirkpatrick
3;26;13167;87;did, swaying, wavering at her words,;kirkpatrick
3;26;13168;88;to be re-made, complete in conﬁdence;kirkpatrick
3;26;13169;89;that ﬂowed from my own burning urge to speak.;kirkpatrick
3;26;13170;90;‘You are the single apple,’ I began,;kirkpatrick
3;26;13171;91;‘produced as full and ripe. In kin and law,;kirkpatrick
3;26;13172;92;to you all brides are daughters, ﬁrst of men.;kirkpatrick
3;26;13173;93;I beg, with all the reverence I can bring,;kirkpatrick
3;26;13174;94;that you should speak to me. You know my will.;kirkpatrick
3;26;13175;95;And so – to hear you sooner – I’ll not say.’;kirkpatrick
3;26;13176;96;A beast will sometimes wriggle in a sack,;kirkpatrick
3;26;13177;97;and so display the feelings that it has;kirkpatrick
3;26;13178;98;from how the wrapping follows what it does.;kirkpatrick
3;26;13179;99;In that same way, the ﬁrst of human souls;kirkpatrick
3;26;13180;100;made me see clearly, through his covering,;kirkpatrick
3;26;13181;101;how light of heart he was to meet my will.;kirkpatrick
3;26;13182;102;And then he breathed: ‘Without your oﬀering,;kirkpatrick
3;26;13183;103;I understand what you desire to know;kirkpatrick
3;26;13184;104;better than you know all you hold most sure.;kirkpatrick
3;26;13185;105;I see this shining truly in the glass;kirkpatrick
3;26;13186;106;that holds the pure pareil of other things,;kirkpatrick
3;26;13187;107;and yet in nothing ﬁnds its parallel.;kirkpatrick
3;26;13188;108;You wish to hear how long God had me stay;kirkpatrick
3;26;13189;109;within that garden rising to the heights;kirkpatrick
3;26;13190;110;"where she, your donna , set you on this stair;";kirkpatrick
3;26;13191;111;how long that garden gave my eye delight,;kirkpatrick
3;26;13192;112;and what the reason was for God’s ﬁerce scorn,;kirkpatrick
3;26;13193;113;and what the language was I formed and used.;kirkpatrick
3;26;13194;114;My dearest son, the tasting of the tree;kirkpatrick
3;26;13195;115;was not itself the cause of banishment,;kirkpatrick
3;26;13196;116;but rather our transgression of the mark.;kirkpatrick
3;26;13197;117;From where your donna once sent Virgil out,;kirkpatrick
3;26;13198;118;four thousand revolutions of the sun,;kirkpatrick
3;26;13199;119;two hundred more then two, I craved this court.;kirkpatrick
3;26;13200;120;I’d seen the sun, with all its lights, return;kirkpatrick
3;26;13201;121;along the starry road, nine hundred times;kirkpatrick
3;26;13202;122;then thirty, in the years I passed on earth.;kirkpatrick
3;26;13203;123;The language that I spoke was wholly spent;kirkpatrick
3;26;13204;124;before the tribe of Nimrod set their minds;kirkpatrick
3;26;13205;125;on work that could not, ever, reach fulﬁlment.;kirkpatrick
3;26;13206;126;For nothing that our natural powers eﬀect;kirkpatrick
3;26;13207;127;(since human pleasures, as the years pass by,;kirkpatrick
3;26;13208;128;are always new) was ever durable.;kirkpatrick
3;26;13209;129;It’s Nature’s work that human beings speak.;kirkpatrick
3;26;13210;130;But whether thus or thus, man’s nature leaves;kirkpatrick
3;26;13211;131;to you to fashion as you may best please.;kirkpatrick
3;26;13212;132;Before I sank to Hell’s deep agonies,;kirkpatrick
3;26;13213;133;the Highest Good – from which derives the joy;kirkpatrick
3;26;13214;134;I’m swathed in here – was known on earth as “I”.;kirkpatrick
3;26;13215;135;Then afterwards we called it El. Needs must.;kirkpatrick
3;26;13216;136;With mortal usages, like leaves along;kirkpatrick
3;26;13217;137;a branch, one goes and then another comes.;kirkpatrick
3;26;13218;138;On that mount rising highest from the sea;kirkpatrick
3;26;13219;139;I was – in pure, and then dishonoured, life –;kirkpatrick
3;26;13220;140;from when the ﬁrst hour dawns until the hour;kirkpatrick
3;26;13221;141;that follows, as the sun moves zone, the sixth.’;kirkpatrick
3;27;13222;1;‘To Father and Son and the Holy Ghost,;kirkpatrick
3;27;13223;2;glory on high!’ all Heaven here began,;kirkpatrick
3;27;13224;3;till I, at that sweet song, reeled drunkenly.;kirkpatrick
3;27;13225;4;And what I saw, it seemed, was now the laughter;kirkpatrick
3;27;13226;5;of all the universe. So drunkenness, for me,;kirkpatrick
3;27;13227;6;came in through hearing and, no less, through sight.;kirkpatrick
3;27;13228;7;The joy of that! The happiness beyond all words!;kirkpatrick
3;27;13229;8;A life of peace and love, entire and whole!;kirkpatrick
3;27;13230;9;Riches all free of craving, troubleless!;kirkpatrick
3;27;13231;10;The faces of the four before my eyes;kirkpatrick
3;27;13232;11;were bright with ﬁre. That soul (the ﬁrst who came) began;kirkpatrick
3;27;13233;12;to grow more brilliant still at this.;kirkpatrick
3;27;13234;13;And now, in how it looked, this face became;kirkpatrick
3;27;13235;14;what Jove would be if he and Mars were birds,;kirkpatrick
3;27;13236;15;and both exchanged their plumage, white for red.;kirkpatrick
3;27;13237;16;The providence that makes division here;kirkpatrick
3;27;13238;17;of duties, tasks and oﬃces imposed;kirkpatrick
3;27;13239;18;a perfect silence on the holy choir.;kirkpatrick
3;27;13240;19;And then I heard: ‘If I change colour now,;kirkpatrick
3;27;13241;20;don’t be amazed at that. For all of these,;kirkpatrick
3;27;13242;21;as I go on, you’ll see change colour, too.;kirkpatrick
3;27;13243;22;He who on earth has robbed me of my place,;kirkpatrick
3;27;13244;23;my place, my place – which therefore, in the sight;kirkpatrick
3;27;13245;24;of God’s dear Son, stands vacant now – has made;kirkpatrick
3;27;13246;25;of my own burial ground a shit hole;kirkpatrick
3;27;13247;26;reeking of blood and pus. In this the sod;kirkpatrick
3;27;13248;27;who fell from here down there takes sheer delight.’;kirkpatrick
3;27;13249;28;With that same colour that a cloud takes on,;kirkpatrick
3;27;13250;29;morning or evening, when it meets the sun,;kirkpatrick
3;27;13251;30;I saw, in every part, the heavens ﬂush.;kirkpatrick
3;27;13252;31;And as some innocent – herself quite clean;kirkpatrick
3;27;13253;32;in conscience – when she notes another’s fault;kirkpatrick
3;27;13254;33;may still, on hearing this, grow chaste and shy,;kirkpatrick
3;27;13255;34;so Beatrice changed in countenance.;kirkpatrick
3;27;13256;35;So, too, I think the heavens were once eclipsed;kirkpatrick
3;27;13257;36;when Utmost Power submitted to the Cross.;kirkpatrick
3;27;13258;37;And then Saint Peter’s words went on, his voice;kirkpatrick
3;27;13259;38;transformed so utterly from what it was;kirkpatrick
3;27;13260;39;that he, in look, could not have been more changed.;kirkpatrick
3;27;13261;40;‘The Bride of Christ was not brought forth and raised;kirkpatrick
3;27;13262;41;on blood of mine – of Linus, too, and Cletus –;kirkpatrick
3;27;13263;42;to be made use of in pursuit of gold,;kirkpatrick
3;27;13264;43;but rather, to pursue here living joy,;kirkpatrick
3;27;13265;44;Sixtus and Pius, Urban, Calixtus,;kirkpatrick
3;27;13266;45;after harsh tears all shed their blood for this.;kirkpatrick
3;27;13267;46;We did not mean that some of Christ’s own race;kirkpatrick
3;27;13268;47;should sit in favour on our heirs’ right hand,;kirkpatrick
3;27;13269;48;"and others, to the left, incur disgrace;";kirkpatrick
3;27;13270;49;nor that the keys entrusted to my hands;kirkpatrick
3;27;13271;50;should serve as battle emblem on the ﬂag;kirkpatrick
3;27;13272;51;"that fought against those marked by baptism;";kirkpatrick
3;27;13273;52;nor that, myself, I should become the stamp;kirkpatrick
3;27;13274;53;that seals the sale of untrue privilege.;kirkpatrick
3;27;13275;54;I ﬂare and redden often at this thought.;kirkpatrick
3;27;13276;55;Down there, in every pasture, ravening wolves;kirkpatrick
3;27;13277;56;are seen dressed up as shepherds and as priests.;kirkpatrick
3;27;13278;57;God our defence, why are you still unmoved?;kirkpatrick
3;27;13279;58;Gascons along with bankers from Cahors;kirkpatrick
3;27;13280;59;prepare themselves to drink our martyr blood.;kirkpatrick
3;27;13281;60;To what corrupted ends good starts may sink!;kirkpatrick
3;27;13282;61;But Providence on high that made defence;kirkpatrick
3;27;13283;62;through Scipio at Rome of this world’s fame;kirkpatrick
3;27;13284;63;will soon, as I conceive it, oﬀer aid.;kirkpatrick
3;27;13285;64;And you, my son, whose body weighs you down;kirkpatrick
3;27;13286;65;so you’ll return below, speak openly;kirkpatrick
3;27;13287;66;and do not hide what I don’t hide from you.’;kirkpatrick
3;27;13288;67;When sun and Goat Horn touch as winter signs,;kirkpatrick
3;27;13289;68;the air in our terrestrial atmosphere;kirkpatrick
3;27;13290;69;ﬂoats down in falls of frozen vapour ﬂakes.;kirkpatrick
3;27;13291;70;So now I saw, with upward sweeping ﬂakes,;kirkpatrick
3;27;13292;71;the aether decked in those triumphant airs;kirkpatrick
3;27;13293;72;that ﬁrst had passed their time with us below.;kirkpatrick
3;27;13294;73;My eyes, in following these semblances,;kirkpatrick
3;27;13295;74;followed until the space between became;kirkpatrick
3;27;13296;75;so great it took away sight’s power to pass.;kirkpatrick
3;27;13297;76;At which my lady, seeing me absolved;kirkpatrick
3;27;13298;77;from all attention to the heights, now said:;kirkpatrick
3;27;13299;78;‘Now sink your gaze, and see how far you’ve turned.’;kirkpatrick
3;27;13300;79;I saw that since the time I’d ﬁrst looked down;kirkpatrick
3;27;13301;80;I’d moved in those six hours through all the arc,;kirkpatrick
3;27;13302;81;mid-point to end, the ﬁrst zone makes on earth,;kirkpatrick
3;27;13303;82;so that I saw, beyond Cadiz, the mad;kirkpatrick
3;27;13304;83;sea-jaunt of Ulysses and, east, the shore;kirkpatrick
3;27;13305;84;where soft Europa once was borne away.;kirkpatrick
3;27;13306;85;And more still of that eastward threshing ﬂoor;kirkpatrick
3;27;13307;86;would have been shown me but, beneath my feet,;kirkpatrick
3;27;13308;87;the sun, processing, reached a farther sign.;kirkpatrick
3;27;13309;88;My mind, so deep in love that always woos,;kirkpatrick
3;27;13310;89;as donna , my donna , burned more ﬁercely still;kirkpatrick
3;27;13311;90;to turn its eyes once more to where she was.;kirkpatrick
3;27;13312;91;Though art or nature, to possess our minds,;kirkpatrick
3;27;13313;92;may, in its paintings or in ﬂesh itself,;kirkpatrick
3;27;13314;93;produce beguiling pastures for our eyes,;kirkpatrick
3;27;13315;94;these all would seem as nothing when compared;kirkpatrick
3;27;13316;95;with that divine delight which shone on me;kirkpatrick
3;27;13317;96;when I turned round to see her smiling look.;kirkpatrick
3;27;13318;97;The inward powers her glance bestowed on me,;kirkpatrick
3;27;13319;98;uprooting me from Leda’s lovely nest,;kirkpatrick
3;27;13320;99;impelled me to the swiftest of the skies.;kirkpatrick
3;27;13321;100;Its regions so exalted, living bright,;kirkpatrick
3;27;13322;101;are all so uniform I cannot say;kirkpatrick
3;27;13323;102;which Beatrice chose to be my place.;kirkpatrick
3;27;13324;103;But she, who saw the strength of my desire,;kirkpatrick
3;27;13325;104;laughing with such great happiness;kirkpatrick
3;27;13326;105;that God appeared rejoicing in her face:;kirkpatrick
3;27;13327;106;‘The order in the natural spheres that stills;kirkpatrick
3;27;13328;107;the central point and moves, round that, all else,;kirkpatrick
3;27;13329;108;here sets its conﬁne and begins its rule.;kirkpatrick
3;27;13330;109;This primal sphere has no “where” other than;kirkpatrick
3;27;13331;110;the mind of God. The love that makes it turn;kirkpatrick
3;27;13332;111;is kindled there, so, too, the powers it rains.;kirkpatrick
3;27;13333;112;Brightness and love contain it in one ring,;kirkpatrick
3;27;13334;113;as this, in turn, contains the spheres below.;kirkpatrick
3;27;13335;114;And only He who binds it knows the bond.;kirkpatrick
3;27;13336;115;Its motion is not gauged by other marks.;kirkpatrick
3;27;13337;116;All other marks are measured out from this –;kirkpatrick
3;27;13338;117;as ten is factored by its half and ﬁfth.;kirkpatrick
3;27;13339;118;So now it will be clear to you how Time;kirkpatrick
3;27;13340;119;takes root within the humus of this bowl,;kirkpatrick
3;27;13341;120;and shows its fronds in every other part.;kirkpatrick
3;27;13342;121;Crass, itching greed! You plunge our mortal sense;kirkpatrick
3;27;13343;122;so far within your depth that none can drag;kirkpatrick
3;27;13344;123;their eyes above the mounting turbulence!;kirkpatrick
3;27;13345;124;Intention blossoms well in human hearts.;kirkpatrick
3;27;13346;125;But rain, unending rain, will render down;kirkpatrick
3;27;13347;126;the true, ripe plum to shrivelled pods of blight.;kirkpatrick
3;27;13348;127;Good faith and innocence are only found;kirkpatrick
3;27;13349;128;in infant schools. And both will long have ﬂed;kirkpatrick
3;27;13350;129;before the cheek is covered with a beard.;kirkpatrick
3;27;13351;130;There’s one kid, burbling still, awaiting food,;kirkpatrick
3;27;13352;131;who when he’s ﬂuent in his speech will gorge;kirkpatrick
3;27;13353;132;on every dish, beneath whatever moon.;kirkpatrick
3;27;13354;133;There’s one there (burbling, too) who loves his mum;kirkpatrick
3;27;13355;134;and heeds her words, who, when his tongue grows whole,;kirkpatrick
3;27;13356;135;will long to see her buried in her grave.;kirkpatrick
3;27;13357;136;And so the whitest skin is scorched pitch black;kirkpatrick
3;27;13358;137;merely to glimpse the lovely child of him;kirkpatrick
3;27;13359;138;who brings the dawn and leaves behind the dark.;kirkpatrick
3;27;13360;139;And you – so you should not suppose this strange –;kirkpatrick
3;27;13361;140;think that on earth there’s no one who will rule,;kirkpatrick
3;27;13362;141;and so the human family goes astray.;kirkpatrick
3;27;13363;142;But those neglected hundredths in our dates;kirkpatrick
3;27;13364;143;will make of January a spring-song month;kirkpatrick
3;27;13365;144;before these circling heights send down such rays;kirkpatrick
3;27;13366;145;that storms of fortune, so long waited for,;kirkpatrick
3;27;13367;146;will spin the stern to where the prow is now,;kirkpatrick
3;27;13368;147;so all the ﬂeet will run a proper course,;kirkpatrick
3;27;13369;148;and fruit will follow truly from the ﬂower.’;kirkpatrick
3;28;13370;1;In contradiction of the life now led;kirkpatrick
3;28;13371;2;in mortal misery, she – the in-paradizer;kirkpatrick
3;28;13372;3;of my mind – had thus laid open Truth to me.;kirkpatrick
3;28;13373;4;Then, as in mirrors, when the light’s behind,;kirkpatrick
3;28;13374;5;we see, although in sight and thought we’ve yet;kirkpatrick
3;28;13375;6;to grasp the fact, the ﬂame of some twin torch;kirkpatrick
3;28;13376;7;(so turn around to see if that smooth glass;kirkpatrick
3;28;13377;8;has told the truth and see it does accord,;kirkpatrick
3;28;13378;9;as words in song when sung upon their beat),;kirkpatrick
3;28;13379;10;so too did I – my memory now records –;kirkpatrick
3;28;13380;11;still looking back towards those lovely eyes,;kirkpatrick
3;28;13381;12;from which, to snare me, love had made the cord.;kirkpatrick
3;28;13382;13;And once I’d turned – and once my eyes were touched;kirkpatrick
3;28;13383;14;by what appears within that scroll to those;kirkpatrick
3;28;13384;15;who look aright within its turning sphere –;kirkpatrick
3;28;13385;16;a single point I saw, that shot out rays;kirkpatrick
3;28;13386;17;so sharp the eye on which it ﬁxes ﬁre;kirkpatrick
3;28;13387;18;is bound to close against that needle-strength.;kirkpatrick
3;28;13388;19;Even the star that, seen from here, seems least;kirkpatrick
3;28;13389;20;would seem, when set beside that point (as star;kirkpatrick
3;28;13390;21;is set by star), a moon in magnitude.;kirkpatrick
3;28;13391;22;As close as, perhaps, coronae appear;kirkpatrick
3;28;13392;23;around the lights that shape and colour them;kirkpatrick
3;28;13393;24;when halo-bearing vapours are most dense,;kirkpatrick
3;28;13394;25;around that point, to similar extent,;kirkpatrick
3;28;13395;26;ﬁre in a circle whirled at such great speed;kirkpatrick
3;28;13396;27;its motion would surpass all clasped round earth.;kirkpatrick
3;28;13397;28;This was, in orbit, bounded by the next,;kirkpatrick
3;28;13398;29;by that, a third, the third, then, by a fourth,;kirkpatrick
3;28;13399;30;by ﬁve that four, and then by six that ﬁve.;kirkpatrick
3;28;13400;31;Then, round all these, a seventh ran, so stretched;kirkpatrick
3;28;13401;32;to generous breadth that Juno’s messenger,;kirkpatrick
3;28;13402;33;the rainbow arc, would hardly hold the all.;kirkpatrick
3;28;13403;34;Likewise, the eighth and ninth. And each of these;kirkpatrick
3;28;13404;35;moved still more slowly as the count went on,;kirkpatrick
3;28;13405;36;running, in number, outward from the one.;kirkpatrick
3;28;13406;37;And that possessed the clearest ﬂame of all;kirkpatrick
3;28;13407;38;from which the purest spark stood least far oﬀ,;kirkpatrick
3;28;13408;39;because, I think, that ﬂame in-truthed the most.;kirkpatrick
3;28;13409;40;My lady, seeing me caught up in hard;kirkpatrick
3;28;13410;41;concerns, spoke out: ‘From that one point;kirkpatrick
3;28;13411;42;depends both Heaven and all of Nature’s world.;kirkpatrick
3;28;13412;43;Look, in pure wonder, at that circle joined;kirkpatrick
3;28;13413;44;most nearly to the point, and know it moves;kirkpatrick
3;28;13414;45;so fast impelled in point of burning love.’;kirkpatrick
3;28;13415;46;‘Suppose the universe,’ I said to her,;kirkpatrick
3;28;13416;47;‘were ordered as I see these wheels to be,;kirkpatrick
3;28;13417;48;then I would rest well fed with your proposal.;kirkpatrick
3;28;13418;49;But in the realm of sense experience;kirkpatrick
3;28;13419;50;the orbits, we can see, are more divine;kirkpatrick
3;28;13420;51;when these stand furthest from the earth’s mid-core.;kirkpatrick
3;28;13421;52;And so if, in this temple, set apart,;kirkpatrick
3;28;13422;53;its conﬁnes marked by love and light alone,;kirkpatrick
3;28;13423;54;my own desires will ever reach their end,;kirkpatrick
3;28;13424;55;I need to hear how type and prototype;kirkpatrick
3;28;13425;56;are not conﬁgured in a single mode.;kirkpatrick
3;28;13426;57;For that I contemplate quite fruitlessly.’;kirkpatrick
3;28;13427;58;‘It’s hardly any miracle if you,;kirkpatrick
3;28;13428;59;with your own hands, cannot untie that knot.;kirkpatrick
3;28;13429;60;It’s got so stiﬀ since no one works at it!’;kirkpatrick
3;28;13430;61;These were my lady’s words. And then: ‘Just get;kirkpatrick
3;28;13431;62;what I’ll now tell you if you want your ﬁll,;kirkpatrick
3;28;13432;63;and sharpen thought to subtlety round that.;kirkpatrick
3;28;13433;64;The circling of these bodies, wide or strict,;kirkpatrick
3;28;13434;65;follow proportioned to the power that ﬂows;kirkpatrick
3;28;13435;66;diﬀused in all their parts, here more, here less.;kirkpatrick
3;28;13436;67;A greater goodness means a greater health.;kirkpatrick
3;28;13437;68;A greater health is held in greater limbs,;kirkpatrick
3;28;13438;69;if these, throughout, are perfect equally.;kirkpatrick
3;28;13439;70;Therefore this sphere – the Primum Mobile –;kirkpatrick
3;28;13440;71;which draws the universe entire along;kirkpatrick
3;28;13441;72;answers the circle that most loves and knows.;kirkpatrick
3;28;13442;73;And so if, with your rule, you compass round;kirkpatrick
3;28;13443;74;the virtue and the strength of what these are,;kirkpatrick
3;28;13444;75;and not their look, which shows as circular,;kirkpatrick
3;28;13445;76;you’ll see a wonderful coincidence –;kirkpatrick
3;28;13446;77;according to intelligence in every sphere –;kirkpatrick
3;28;13447;78;between the less and least, greater and more.’;kirkpatrick
3;28;13448;79;Compare: when Boreas, the northern wind,;kirkpatrick
3;28;13449;80;blows from his milder cheek, our hemisphere;kirkpatrick
3;28;13450;81;is left serene, its air bright, sparkling, clear.;kirkpatrick
3;28;13451;82;The crusted scum of clouds that swirled there ﬁrst;kirkpatrick
3;28;13452;83;is freed and clariﬁed. The whole sky laughs.;kirkpatrick
3;28;13453;84;Its many beauties smile round every steeple.;kirkpatrick
3;28;13454;85;So I became, as – caring for my good –;kirkpatrick
3;28;13455;86;my lady answered with such clarity,;kirkpatrick
3;28;13456;87;and truth was seen as stars are in the sky.;kirkpatrick
3;28;13457;88;And when these words of hers had come to rest,;kirkpatrick
3;28;13458;89;then, as when boiling iron sparks and spurts,;kirkpatrick
3;28;13459;90;so, too, these circles ﬂung oﬀ their own sparks.;kirkpatrick
3;28;13460;91;This surge of ﬁre was following every glint.;kirkpatrick
3;28;13461;92;These glints, en-thousanding, outnumbered far;kirkpatrick
3;28;13462;93;progressive doubling of the chessboard squares.;kirkpatrick
3;28;13463;94;And rising, choir to choir, I heard ‘Hosanna’;kirkpatrick
3;28;13464;95;sung to that point which, ﬁxed there, holds them all, and;kirkpatrick
3;28;13465;96;always will, ubi they’ve always been.;kirkpatrick
3;28;13466;97;And seeing in my mind what doubts I had,;kirkpatrick
3;28;13467;98;she now declared: ‘The circles that I ﬁrst;kirkpatrick
3;28;13468;99;made known are Cherubim and Seraphim.;kirkpatrick
3;28;13469;100;Each runs so swiftly round its twining hoop,;kirkpatrick
3;28;13470;101;to be as like that point as possible,;kirkpatrick
3;28;13471;102;succeeding, through sublimity of sight.;kirkpatrick
3;28;13472;103;And round these run those other forms of love,;kirkpatrick
3;28;13473;104;known as the Thrones, receiving God’s regard.;kirkpatrick
3;28;13474;105;With these, the ﬁrst of triads terminates.;kirkpatrick
3;28;13475;106;And all, as you must know, have their delight;kirkpatrick
3;28;13476;107;according to how deep their sight goes down;kirkpatrick
3;28;13477;108;into the truth that calms all intellect.;kirkpatrick
3;28;13478;109;You’ll see from this that being truly blessed;kirkpatrick
3;28;13479;110;resides upon the act by which we see,;kirkpatrick
3;28;13480;111;and not in act of love. This follows that.;kirkpatrick
3;28;13481;112;And seeing takes its measure from the worth;kirkpatrick
3;28;13482;113;that grace and truest purpose bring to birth.;kirkpatrick
3;28;13483;114;And so the scale proceeds from step to step.;kirkpatrick
3;28;13484;115;The second triad where the sap thus ﬂows;kirkpatrick
3;28;13485;116;within this sempiternal springtime season –;kirkpatrick
3;28;13486;117;which night-ascendant Aries never spoils –;kirkpatrick
3;28;13487;118;sings out perpetually that winter’s done,;kirkpatrick
3;28;13488;119;“Osanna!” in three tunes that sound in three;kirkpatrick
3;28;13489;120;orders of happiness, each one en-threeing here.;kirkpatrick
3;28;13490;121;The other gods in this hierarchic rank;kirkpatrick
3;28;13491;122;are ﬁrstly Dominations, Virtues next,;kirkpatrick
3;28;13492;123;then, thirdly, there’s the Order of the Powers.;kirkpatrick
3;28;13493;124;In three-some reels the two penultimates;kirkpatrick
3;28;13494;125;are Principalities, Archangels, too.;kirkpatrick
3;28;13495;126;The last of all is all Angelic games.;kirkpatrick
3;28;13496;127;This order all in wonder gaze above;kirkpatrick
3;28;13497;128;and triumph so, beneath, that up to God;kirkpatrick
3;28;13498;129;they all are drawn and draw up all to all.;kirkpatrick
3;28;13499;130;And Dionysius with such desire;kirkpatrick
3;28;13500;131;set out to contemplate these nine-fold ranks;kirkpatrick
3;28;13501;132;that he deﬁned and named them as I do.;kirkpatrick
3;28;13502;133;But Gregory departed from his view.;kirkpatrick
3;28;13503;134;And so, the moment that he reached this sphere,;kirkpatrick
3;28;13504;135;opening his eyes, he laughed, self-mockingly.;kirkpatrick
3;28;13505;136;And if, on earth, a mortal could display;kirkpatrick
3;28;13506;137;a truth so secret, please don’t be amazed.;kirkpatrick
3;28;13507;138;This was revealed by one who saw up here –;kirkpatrick
3;28;13508;139;and much else of truth of these great gyres.’;kirkpatrick
3;29;13509;1;When moon and sun, the children of Latona,;kirkpatrick
3;29;13510;2;covered by Libra and the spring-starred Ram,;kirkpatrick
3;29;13511;3;each takes, to form its belt, the same horizon,;kirkpatrick
3;29;13512;4;the length of time from when the zenith comes;kirkpatrick
3;29;13513;5;to equipoise to when these two, in change;kirkpatrick
3;29;13514;6;of hemisphere, unbalance in that zone,;kirkpatrick
3;29;13515;7;was all the time that Beatrice stayed;kirkpatrick
3;29;13516;8;silent – her laughter brushed across her face,;kirkpatrick
3;29;13517;9;ﬁxed on the point that ﬁrst defeated me.;kirkpatrick
3;29;13518;10;Then she began: ‘I’ll say – though ask, I won’t –;kirkpatrick
3;29;13519;11;what you now want to hear. I’ve seen it there;kirkpatrick
3;29;13520;12;where every “when” and “where” attains its point.;kirkpatrick
3;29;13521;13;Not seeking any good that He had not –;kirkpatrick
3;29;13522;14;there can be none – but so his shining-out;kirkpatrick
3;29;13523;15;could in return shine back and say: “I am”,;kirkpatrick
3;29;13524;16;in His eternity beyond all time,;kirkpatrick
3;29;13525;17;beyond our understanding, as He pleased,;kirkpatrick
3;29;13526;18;to new loves Love Eternal opened out.;kirkpatrick
3;29;13527;19;Nor had He lain in torpor till that time,;kirkpatrick
3;29;13528;20;for neither “then” nor “now” could come before;kirkpatrick
3;29;13529;21;the ﬂowing-forth of God above these waves.;kirkpatrick
3;29;13530;22;Real form and matter (both conjoined and pure),;kirkpatrick
3;29;13531;23;issued in being where there was no ﬂaw,;kirkpatrick
3;29;13532;24;as from a three-string bow three arrows ﬂy.;kirkpatrick
3;29;13533;25;Light rays that enter amber, crystal, glass,;kirkpatrick
3;29;13534;26;display such luminescence that, from when;kirkpatrick
3;29;13535;27;they reach, then are there wholly, there’s no pause.;kirkpatrick
3;29;13536;28;Likewise, the three-fold action of light’s lord;kirkpatrick
3;29;13537;29;shone brightly through all being, all as one,;kirkpatrick
3;29;13538;30;without distinction in that opening word.;kirkpatrick
3;29;13539;31;Rank and relationship were co-create;kirkpatrick
3;29;13540;32;with these true beings who, within the world;kirkpatrick
3;29;13541;33;(pure act produced in them), stand at the height;kirkpatrick
3;29;13542;34;where, at the lowest, there’s pure potency,;kirkpatrick
3;29;13543;35;between these two an intertwining binds;kirkpatrick
3;29;13544;36;pure potency to act – and never disentwines.;kirkpatrick
3;29;13545;37;Jerome proposed to you a long elapse;kirkpatrick
3;29;13546;38;of centuries of angels from creation’s point;kirkpatrick
3;29;13547;39;before the other world was ever formed.;kirkpatrick
3;29;13548;40;The truth is written, though, in many parts –;kirkpatrick
3;29;13549;41;by writers listening to the Holy Ghost –;kirkpatrick
3;29;13550;42;as you, if you look carefully, will see.;kirkpatrick
3;29;13551;43;And even reason can see some of this,;kirkpatrick
3;29;13552;44;refusing to concede that motive-powers;kirkpatrick
3;29;13553;45;should be so long without full carry-through.;kirkpatrick
3;29;13554;46;And now you know the where and when and how;kirkpatrick
3;29;13555;47;that led to the creation of these loves.;kirkpatrick
3;29;13556;48;And so, in your desires, three ﬂames are spent.;kirkpatrick
3;29;13557;49;Counting, you would not get to twice times ten;kirkpatrick
3;29;13558;50;as quickly as the angels, in some part,;kirkpatrick
3;29;13559;51;clouded those elements on which you feed.;kirkpatrick
3;29;13560;52;The rest remained, and then began their art;kirkpatrick
3;29;13561;53;with such great pleasure that, as you can tell,;kirkpatrick
3;29;13562;54;they never choose to leave their circlings.;kirkpatrick
3;29;13563;55;The ﬁrst cause of the fall was that cursed ﬂounce;kirkpatrick
3;29;13564;56;of arrogance, in one whom you have seen;kirkpatrick
3;29;13565;57;gripped tight below the weight of all the world.;kirkpatrick
3;29;13566;58;The angels you see here restrainedly;kirkpatrick
3;29;13567;59;acknowledged of themselves the utmost good;kirkpatrick
3;29;13568;60;who made them quick to understand all this.;kirkpatrick
3;29;13569;61;Their intellectual sight was, therefore, raised;kirkpatrick
3;29;13570;62;through merit and illuminating grace;kirkpatrick
3;29;13571;63;so high that they, in will, are full and ﬁrm.;kirkpatrick
3;29;13572;64;And here I would not have you be in doubt.;kirkpatrick
3;29;13573;65;It is a merit to receive God’s grace,;kirkpatrick
3;29;13574;66;in measure as hearts open up to that.;kirkpatrick
3;29;13575;67;By now, there’s much in this great council hall;kirkpatrick
3;29;13576;68;that, if my words are safely gathered in,;kirkpatrick
3;29;13577;69;you may well contemplate without more aid.;kirkpatrick
3;29;13578;70;But since, down there, your universities;kirkpatrick
3;29;13579;71;argue that angels are of such a kind;kirkpatrick
3;29;13580;72;as understand, have memories and free will,;kirkpatrick
3;29;13581;73;I’ll still continue till you see pure truth –;kirkpatrick
3;29;13582;74;which, in ambiguous lectures there on earth,;kirkpatrick
3;29;13583;75;is doubtful and so easily confused.;kirkpatrick
3;29;13584;76;These beings, full of happiness to see;kirkpatrick
3;29;13585;77;the face of God from which there’s none who hide,;kirkpatrick
3;29;13586;78;at no point turned their eyes away from that.;kirkpatrick
3;29;13587;79;And so their line of vision is not cut;kirkpatrick
3;29;13588;80;by new-formed objects, and they, therefore, need;kirkpatrick
3;29;13589;81;no memory (thought dividing these from thought).;kirkpatrick
3;29;13590;82;And so, down there, not sleeping, still they dream,;kirkpatrick
3;29;13591;83;thinking they speak the truth – or thinking not.;kirkpatrick
3;29;13592;84;The latter brings more guilt and greater shame.;kirkpatrick
3;29;13593;85;Philosophizing, you, down there, do not;kirkpatrick
3;29;13594;86;proceed by any one true path. You’re swept;kirkpatrick
3;29;13595;87;along by show and love of showy thoughts.;kirkpatrick
3;29;13596;88;Yet even this is tolerated here;kirkpatrick
3;29;13597;89;with less contempt than when God’s Holy Writ;kirkpatrick
3;29;13598;90;is put aside or twisted out of true.;kirkpatrick
3;29;13599;91;No thought is given to what blood it cost;kirkpatrick
3;29;13600;92;to sow that seed on earth, nor what delight;kirkpatrick
3;29;13601;93;is given when we humbly stick to that.;kirkpatrick
3;29;13602;94;All bend their wits to mere display, and strive;kirkpatrick
3;29;13603;95;for bright ideas. Then preachers ﬂick-read these,;kirkpatrick
3;29;13604;96;and, as to what the Gospels say, are mute.;kirkpatrick
3;29;13605;97;One argues that, when Christ died on the Cross,;kirkpatrick
3;29;13606;98;the moon turned back to form an obstacle,;kirkpatrick
3;29;13607;99;so sunlight could not show itself down here.;kirkpatrick
3;29;13608;100;All lies! The light hid by its own free choice.;kirkpatrick
3;29;13609;101;And that is why the same eclipse replied;kirkpatrick
3;29;13610;102;to Indians and to Spaniards as to Jews.;kirkpatrick
3;29;13611;103;There aren’t, in Florence, half so many wops;kirkpatrick
3;29;13612;104;as all around in pulpits every year,;kirkpatrick
3;29;13613;105;such poppycockeries get blurted out.;kirkpatrick
3;29;13614;106;And so the sheep, who don’t know anything ,;kirkpatrick
3;29;13615;107;come from the pasture pastured full of wind.;kirkpatrick
3;29;13616;108;It’s no excuse that they don’t see the harm.;kirkpatrick
3;29;13617;109;Christ did not say, to his ﬁrst holy band,;kirkpatrick
3;29;13618;110;“Go out and preach pure prattle to the world.”;kirkpatrick
3;29;13619;111;He gave them true foundations that would stand.;kirkpatrick
3;29;13620;112;And these resounded in their cheeks so well;kirkpatrick
3;29;13621;113;that, ﬁghting to ignite the ﬁre of faith,;kirkpatrick
3;29;13622;114;they used the Gospel as both shield and lance.;kirkpatrick
3;29;13623;115;Now preachers go with feeble jokes and gags;kirkpatrick
3;29;13624;116;and, just so long as they can raise a laugh,;kirkpatrick
3;29;13625;117;their hoods puﬀ up. They ask for nothing more.;kirkpatrick
3;29;13626;118;A devil bird, though, nestles in their cowls.;kirkpatrick
3;29;13627;119;Were folk to see this, they would see (they must!);kirkpatrick
3;29;13628;120;what sort of pardons these are they so trust.;kirkpatrick
3;29;13629;121;And so such idiocy grows on earth;kirkpatrick
3;29;13630;122;that all, without good evidence or proof,;kirkpatrick
3;29;13631;123;chase after every promise they hear made.;kirkpatrick
3;29;13632;124;Pigs of Saint Anthony grow plump on these –;kirkpatrick
3;29;13633;125;and many others, too, still bigger pigs –;kirkpatrick
3;29;13634;126;paying with currency that bears no stamp.;kirkpatrick
3;29;13635;127;But we’ve digressed enough. So turn your eyes;kirkpatrick
3;29;13636;128;once more towards the road that lies ahead,;kirkpatrick
3;29;13637;129;so that we cut our path to suit our hours.;kirkpatrick
3;29;13638;130;In number, the angelic natures climb;kirkpatrick
3;29;13639;131;so far beyond us that no mortal tongue;kirkpatrick
3;29;13640;132;nor human thought could ever reach to that.;kirkpatrick
3;29;13641;133;And if you note what Daniel has revealed,;kirkpatrick
3;29;13642;134;you’ll see, while speaking of the “thousands” there, the;kirkpatrick
3;29;13643;135;ﬁnal number is concealed from view.;kirkpatrick
3;29;13644;136;The primal light, whose rays shine out on all,;kirkpatrick
3;29;13645;137;is taken up in ways as numerous;kirkpatrick
3;29;13646;138;as there are splendours that it couples with.;kirkpatrick
3;29;13647;139;Therefore, since depth of feeling follows act,;kirkpatrick
3;29;13648;140;in each of these the sweetness of their love;kirkpatrick
3;29;13649;141;seethes diﬀerently – and diﬀerent, too, in warmth.;kirkpatrick
3;29;13650;142;See now the height and all the generous breadth;kirkpatrick
3;29;13651;143;of God’s eternal worth. These mirrors all;kirkpatrick
3;29;13652;144;were made by Him, where He Himself now breaks,;kirkpatrick
3;29;13653;145;one in Himself remaining as before.’;kirkpatrick
3;30;13654;1;Maybe, around six thousand miles away,;kirkpatrick
3;30;13655;2;the sixth hour, close to noon, ﬂares out, while earth;kirkpatrick
3;30;13656;3;inclines its shadow-cone to rest, near level.;kirkpatrick
3;30;13657;4;At this same time, the mid-point of the sky;kirkpatrick
3;30;13658;5;will start, so deep above us, to transform,;kirkpatrick
3;30;13659;6;and some stars lose their semblance in those depths.;kirkpatrick
3;30;13660;7;Then brightest Aurora who serves the sun;kirkpatrick
3;30;13661;8;advances and, dawning, the skies, vista;kirkpatrick
3;30;13662;9;by vista, are closed till even the loveliest is gone.;kirkpatrick
3;30;13663;10;In this way, too, the victories that play;kirkpatrick
3;30;13664;11;for ever round the point that conquered me –;kirkpatrick
3;30;13665;12;enclosed, it seems, by that which they enclose –  was,;kirkpatrick
3;30;13666;13;little by little, quenched before my gaze.;kirkpatrick
3;30;13667;14;And so, from seeing nothing – and in love –;kirkpatrick
3;30;13668;15;I turned my eyes towards Beatrice.;kirkpatrick
3;30;13669;16;If all that has, till this, been said of her;kirkpatrick
3;30;13670;17;were now enclosed to form one word of praise,;kirkpatrick
3;30;13671;18;it would not, even so, fulﬁl my need.;kirkpatrick
3;30;13672;19;The beauty I saw, transcending every kind,;kirkpatrick
3;30;13673;20;is far beyond us here – nor only us.;kirkpatrick
3;30;13674;21;Its maker, I think, alone could know its joy.;kirkpatrick
3;30;13675;22;From now on, I’ll admit, I’m overwhelmed,;kirkpatrick
3;30;13676;23;defeated worse than all before – in comic;kirkpatrick
3;30;13677;24;or in tragic genre – by what my theme demands.;kirkpatrick
3;30;13678;25;As sunlight trembles in enfeebled eyes,;kirkpatrick
3;30;13679;26;calling to mind how sweet to me her smile was,;kirkpatrick
3;30;13680;27;itself deprives my mind of memory.;kirkpatrick
3;30;13681;28;Not since the day that I, in our ﬁrst life,;kirkpatrick
3;30;13682;29;ﬁrst saw her face until this living sight,;kirkpatrick
3;30;13683;30;has song in me been cut so cleanly short.;kirkpatrick
3;30;13684;31;It is, however, right that I stand down –;kirkpatrick
3;30;13685;32;as every artist, at the utmost, does –;kirkpatrick
3;30;13686;33;and no more trace her beauty, forming verse.;kirkpatrick
3;30;13687;34;And so what then she was I now will leave;kirkpatrick
3;30;13688;35;to clarions far greater than my trumpet sounds, and draw;kirkpatrick
3;30;13689;36;my vaunting line towards its end.;kirkpatrick
3;30;13690;37;As she then was – a guide in word and deed,;kirkpatrick
3;30;13691;38;her work all done – she spoke again: ‘We’ve left the;kirkpatrick
3;30;13692;39;greatest of material spheres, rising;kirkpatrick
3;30;13693;40;to light, pure light of intellect, all love,;kirkpatrick
3;30;13694;41;the love of good in truth, all happiness,;kirkpatrick
3;30;13695;42;a happiness transcending every rapture.;kirkpatrick
3;30;13696;43;Here you will see the two great heavenly ranks,;kirkpatrick
3;30;13697;44;angels and saints – the saints in countenance;kirkpatrick
3;30;13698;45;as you, on Judgement Day, will see them stand.’;kirkpatrick
3;30;13699;46;As lights, when ﬂashing suddenly, disperse;kirkpatrick
3;30;13700;47;the spirits of the retina, and rob;kirkpatrick
3;30;13701;48;the eye of seeing even strong, bright things,;kirkpatrick
3;30;13702;49;so, bright around me, shone a living light;kirkpatrick
3;30;13703;50;that left me, baby-like, in swaddling weaves;kirkpatrick
3;30;13704;51;of brilliance, so that nothing showed to me.;kirkpatrick
3;30;13705;52;‘The love that gives this Heaven its quietness;kirkpatrick
3;30;13706;53;will always make its saving welcome thus,;kirkpatrick
3;30;13707;54;to form a candle ready for its ﬂame.’;kirkpatrick
3;30;13708;55;No sooner had these brief words entered me;kirkpatrick
3;30;13709;56;than I rose up – as truly I could tell –;kirkpatrick
3;30;13710;57;above the summit of my natural powers.;kirkpatrick
3;30;13711;58;New seeing-strength I kindled in myself,;kirkpatrick
3;30;13712;59;so that no light, however crystalline,;kirkpatrick
3;30;13713;60;could cause my eyes to close in self-defence.;kirkpatrick
3;30;13714;61;I saw light form a river in full spate,;kirkpatrick
3;30;13715;62;ﬁre-dazzle-gilded, ﬂowing through verges;kirkpatrick
3;30;13716;63;painted afresh in colours of wonderful spring.;kirkpatrick
3;30;13717;64;And rising from that ﬂood, alive, were sparks;kirkpatrick
3;30;13718;65;that everywhere alighted on the ﬂowers,;kirkpatrick
3;30;13719;66;like rubies set in gold encirclements –;kirkpatrick
3;30;13720;67;then all, as though the perfumes made them drunk,;kirkpatrick
3;30;13721;68;plunged in that swirling miracle once more.;kirkpatrick
3;30;13722;69;And yet where one sank in, still more spun out.;kirkpatrick
3;30;13723;70;‘The ﬁne desire that ﬁres and urges you;kirkpatrick
3;30;13724;71;to gain still fuller news of all you see,;kirkpatrick
3;30;13725;72;delights me more, the more the longing swells.;kirkpatrick
3;30;13726;73;And yet before your thirst is satisﬁed,;kirkpatrick
3;30;13727;74;you’ll need to drink these waters to the full.’;kirkpatrick
3;30;13728;75;Those words were hers, the sunlight of my eyes.;kirkpatrick
3;30;13729;76;Then following: ‘The river and the glint;kirkpatrick
3;30;13730;77;of topaz, in and out, the smile of grass – these all are;kirkpatrick
3;30;13731;78;shadowed prefaces that hint at their own truth.;kirkpatrick
3;30;13732;79;That does not mean that any is, itself,;kirkpatrick
3;30;13733;80;unripe, acid or green. The lack is yours.;kirkpatrick
3;30;13734;81;Your sight as yet cannot move proudly on.’;kirkpatrick
3;30;13735;82;No baby, waking later from its nap;kirkpatrick
3;30;13736;83;than normally it would, so hurled itself;kirkpatrick
3;30;13737;84;face down to mother’s milk as I did now.;kirkpatrick
3;30;13738;85;To make my eyes, as mirrors, better still,;kirkpatrick
3;30;13739;86;I bent towards the wave that, ﬂowing there,;kirkpatrick
3;30;13740;87;will sweep us always onward to in-bettering.;kirkpatrick
3;30;13741;88;I drank to the arching eaves of my brow,;kirkpatrick
3;30;13742;89;and then saw all anew, as though that length;kirkpatrick
3;30;13743;90;of light had now, in form, become a round.;kirkpatrick
3;30;13744;91;If masqueraders, hidden in their veils,;kirkpatrick
3;30;13745;92;undress those features (not their own) in which they’d;kirkpatrick
3;30;13746;93;vanished once, their look seems somehow changed.;kirkpatrick
3;30;13747;94;So now, it seemed, these ﬂowers and ﬂecks of light;kirkpatrick
3;30;13748;95;altered, to join and celebrate still more.;kirkpatrick
3;30;13749;96;And I saw, now made known, both heavenly courts.;kirkpatrick
3;30;13750;97;Splendour of God! Through you I came to see;kirkpatrick
3;30;13751;98;triumph exalting in the realm of truth.;kirkpatrick
3;30;13752;99;Grant me true strength to say what then I saw.;kirkpatrick
3;30;13753;100;There is, above us there, a light that makes;kirkpatrick
3;30;13754;101;the All-Creator in creation seen;kirkpatrick
3;30;13755;102;by those who only seeing Him have peace.;kirkpatrick
3;30;13756;103;This light became a circle in its form,;kirkpatrick
3;30;13757;104;extending its circumference so far;kirkpatrick
3;30;13758;105;as might a belt too generous round the sun.;kirkpatrick
3;30;13759;106;All that appears is made there by a ray;kirkpatrick
3;30;13760;107;reﬂected from the curve of that First Sphere;kirkpatrick
3;30;13761;108;which draws its life and movings from that light.;kirkpatrick
3;30;13762;109;It is as though the incline of some hill;kirkpatrick
3;30;13763;110;were mirrored in a lake below, as if;kirkpatrick
3;30;13764;111;to view itself adorned in ﬂower and richest green.;kirkpatrick
3;30;13765;112;Above that light, and standing round, I saw;kirkpatrick
3;30;13766;113;a thousand tiers or more as mirrorings;kirkpatrick
3;30;13767;114;of those of ours who’ve now returned up there.;kirkpatrick
3;30;13768;115;Imagine, when the least of all these grades;kirkpatrick
3;30;13769;116;could gather to itself so great a light,;kirkpatrick
3;30;13770;117;how great the wealth is at the rose’s fringe.;kirkpatrick
3;30;13771;118;My eyes, despite such breadth and altitude,;kirkpatrick
3;30;13772;119;were not confused or blurred but took all in –;kirkpatrick
3;30;13773;120;the kind and sum of this light-heartedness.;kirkpatrick
3;30;13774;121;Nothing’s gained here or lost by ‘near’ and ‘far’.;kirkpatrick
3;30;13775;122;For where God rules without some means between, the;kirkpatrick
3;30;13776;123;law of nature bears no weight at all.;kirkpatrick
3;30;13777;124;Into the gold of that now-always rose,;kirkpatrick
3;30;13778;125;which grows from arc to arc, dilates and breathes the;kirkpatrick
3;30;13779;126;scent of praise to always-springtime Sun,;kirkpatrick
3;30;13780;127;she drew me – Beatrice – like someone;kirkpatrick
3;30;13781;128;yearning, while silent, to say: ‘The wonder!;kirkpatrick
3;30;13782;129;Look there, how great this white-caped gathering is!;kirkpatrick
3;30;13783;130;Our city, look! And see how wide it sweeps.;kirkpatrick
3;30;13784;131;The honoured places – look! – they’re almost full, and few;kirkpatrick
3;30;13785;132;we long to see are still to come.;kirkpatrick
3;30;13786;133;Your eyes are ﬁxed upon a single throne,;kirkpatrick
3;30;13787;134;drawn by the crown already set on that.;kirkpatrick
3;30;13788;135;And long before you join this marriage feast,;kirkpatrick
3;30;13789;136;the soul will sit – imperial in the world –;kirkpatrick
3;30;13790;137;of noble Arrigo, who came to rule;kirkpatrick
3;30;13791;138;an Italy unready for him yet.;kirkpatrick
3;30;13792;139;The blind cupidity bewitching you;kirkpatrick
3;30;13793;140;has made you all akin to little brats;kirkpatrick
3;30;13794;141;who – famished, dying – still beat oﬀ their nurse.;kirkpatrick
3;30;13795;142;And in the Sacred Forum one presides;kirkpatrick
3;30;13796;143;whose public and whose covert deeds will not;kirkpatrick
3;30;13797;144;accord or travel in a single groove.;kirkpatrick
3;30;13798;145;But not for long. God will not suﬀer him;kirkpatrick
3;30;13799;146;to keep that sacred role. He’ll soon be ﬂung;kirkpatrick
3;30;13800;147;where Simon Magus gets what he deserves.;kirkpatrick
3;30;13801;148;The Anagnese pope will sink still further down.’;kirkpatrick
3;31;13802;1;In form, then, as a rose, pure, brilliant, white,;kirkpatrick
3;31;13803;2;there stood before me now the sacred ranks;kirkpatrick
3;31;13804;3;that Christ, by His own blood, has made His bride.;kirkpatrick
3;31;13805;4;The other force that, ﬂying, sees and sings;kirkpatrick
3;31;13806;5;the glory that so stirs their love of Him –;kirkpatrick
3;31;13807;6;the goodness, too, that makes them all they are –  came;kirkpatrick
3;31;13808;7;down, as might a swarm of bees that ﬁrst;kirkpatrick
3;31;13809;8;en-ﬂower themselves, returning, afterwards,;kirkpatrick
3;31;13810;9;to where their eﬀorts are made sweet to taste.;kirkpatrick
3;31;13811;10;They search the utmost depths of that great ﬂower,;kirkpatrick
3;31;13812;11;with all its many petals. Then they rise;kirkpatrick
3;31;13813;12;once more to where their love will always dwell.;kirkpatrick
3;31;13814;13;Their faces all were bright with living ﬂame,;kirkpatrick
3;31;13815;14;their wings of gold, their other parts so white;kirkpatrick
3;31;13816;15;that snow has never reached to that extreme.;kirkpatrick
3;31;13817;16;Descending in the ﬂower from tier to tier,;kirkpatrick
3;31;13818;17;they oﬀered peace and all the burning love;kirkpatrick
3;31;13819;18;that they won there (wings fanning down their ﬂanks).;kirkpatrick
3;31;13820;19;Nor, interposed between the ﬂower and height,;kirkpatrick
3;31;13821;20;did all that multitude in ﬂight impede;kirkpatrick
3;31;13822;21;that radiance or the faculties of sight.;kirkpatrick
3;31;13823;22;Divine light pierces through the universe –;kirkpatrick
3;31;13824;23;to be received, as ﬁt, in all degrees –;kirkpatrick
3;31;13825;24;in such a way that nothing can oppose.;kirkpatrick
3;31;13826;25;That realm – its gaudeamus free of strife –;kirkpatrick
3;31;13827;26;where chosen, past and new, such crowds resort,;kirkpatrick
3;31;13828;27;aims all its love and seeing at one sign.;kirkpatrick
3;31;13829;28;O three-fold light that, in one single star,;kirkpatrick
3;31;13830;29;so ﬂashing in their sight brings them content!;kirkpatrick
3;31;13831;30;Look down upon our world of squalls and storms.;kirkpatrick
3;31;13832;31;If savages from northern shores (where skies;kirkpatrick
3;31;13833;32;are dark, day in, day out, under the Helicean sign that;kirkpatrick
3;31;13834;33;gazes, wheeling, on her well-loved son);kirkpatrick
3;31;13835;34;at seeing Rome and her aspiring works;kirkpatrick
3;31;13836;35;are stupeﬁed to view the Lateran,;kirkpatrick
3;31;13837;36;soaring so high above all mortal things,;kirkpatrick
3;31;13838;37;then what of me – from human to divine,;kirkpatrick
3;31;13839;38;coming to this eternal realm from time,;kirkpatrick
3;31;13840;39;from Florence to a nation sane and true –;kirkpatrick
3;31;13841;40;what pure astonishment must I have felt?;kirkpatrick
3;31;13842;41;Indeed, between that shock and solemn joy,;kirkpatrick
3;31;13843;42;I, gladly, did not hear or speak a thing.;kirkpatrick
3;31;13844;43;As pilgrims gaze, enthralled at their new life,;kirkpatrick
3;31;13845;44;around the temple that they’d vowed to reach,;kirkpatrick
3;31;13846;45;hoping to tell, already, where they’ve been,;kirkpatrick
3;31;13847;46;so, pacing upwards through the living light,;kirkpatrick
3;31;13848;47;I drew my eyes through every step and grade;kirkpatrick
3;31;13849;48;now up, now lower, circling all around.;kirkpatrick
3;31;13850;49;I saw there faces swayed to caritas ,;kirkpatrick
3;31;13851;50;arrayed in their own smiles and light not theirs, and all;kirkpatrick
3;31;13852;51;they did adorned with dignity.;kirkpatrick
3;31;13853;52;The general form of Heaven had by now;kirkpatrick
3;31;13854;53;been grasped entirely as my glance swept round,;kirkpatrick
3;31;13855;54;ﬁxing, though, ﬁrmly no particular.;kirkpatrick
3;31;13856;55;And so I turned – my will once more on ﬁre –;kirkpatrick
3;31;13857;56;to ask that she, my lady, should respond.;kirkpatrick
3;31;13858;57;(For here and there, some doubt in me remained.);kirkpatrick
3;31;13859;58;I’d looked for one thing. Something else replied.;kirkpatrick
3;31;13860;59;I’d see Beatrice, as I believed,;kirkpatrick
3;31;13861;60;and saw an elder, robed like all in glory.;kirkpatrick
3;31;13862;61;Around his countenance and eyes there ﬂowed;kirkpatrick
3;31;13863;62;the generosity of joy, his look;kirkpatrick
3;31;13864;63;a gentle father’s, ﬁrm and virtuous.;kirkpatrick
3;31;13865;64;And I at once: ‘Where is she?’ And at this:;kirkpatrick
3;31;13866;65;‘So I can bring an end to your desire,;kirkpatrick
3;31;13867;66;Beatrice moved me from the place I keep.;kirkpatrick
3;31;13868;67;If, to the highest round of that third step,;kirkpatrick
3;31;13869;68;you’ll raise your eyes, you’ll see her on the throne to;kirkpatrick
3;31;13870;69;which her merits have allotted her.’;kirkpatrick
3;31;13871;70;Without reply, I raised my eyes up there;kirkpatrick
3;31;13872;71;and saw her, mirroring eternal rays,;kirkpatrick
3;31;13873;72;to form a crown or aureole around.;kirkpatrick
3;31;13874;73;From that high region where the thunder rolls,;kirkpatrick
3;31;13875;74;no mortal eye could ever be so far –;kirkpatrick
3;31;13876;75;though sunk beneath the ocean’s utmost depth –;kirkpatrick
3;31;13877;76;as my sight was from Beatrice now.;kirkpatrick
3;31;13878;77;Yet that meant nothing. For her image came;kirkpatrick
3;31;13879;78;not blurred or lessened by the space between.;kirkpatrick
3;31;13880;79;‘In you, beloved, my hope grows strong. All this;kirkpatrick
3;31;13881;80;you bore: to greet me and to make me whole,;kirkpatrick
3;31;13882;81;you left your footprint in the depth of Hell.;kirkpatrick
3;31;13883;82;The inward strength and grace of everything;kirkpatrick
3;31;13884;83;I since have seen has come to me, I know,;kirkpatrick
3;31;13885;84;through you, your goodness and your grace and power.;kirkpatrick
3;31;13886;85;From servitude you’ve led me to be free;kirkpatrick
3;31;13887;86;by all those pathways and by all the means;kirkpatrick
3;31;13888;87;you have within your power to exercise.;kirkpatrick
3;31;13889;88;Keep safe in me your own magniﬁcence,;kirkpatrick
3;31;13890;89;so that my soul, since you have made it well,;kirkpatrick
3;31;13891;90;should leave the knot of body, pleasing you.’;kirkpatrick
3;31;13892;91;My prayer was thus. And she, as far away;kirkpatrick
3;31;13893;92;as she might seem, smiled and looked down at me,;kirkpatrick
3;31;13894;93;then turned again towards the eternal spring.;kirkpatrick
3;31;13895;94;The holy patriarch: ‘So you may perfectly;kirkpatrick
3;31;13896;95;attain the summit of the path you take;kirkpatrick
3;31;13897;96;(for that I’m sent, by prayer and holy love),;kirkpatrick
3;31;13898;97;ﬂy through this garden with your wings of sight,;kirkpatrick
3;31;13899;98;for seeing this will make your gaze more ﬁt;kirkpatrick
3;31;13900;99;to climb towards the radiance of God.;kirkpatrick
3;31;13901;100;The Heavenly Queen – I burn in all my soul;kirkpatrick
3;31;13902;101;for love of her – will bring us every grace.;kirkpatrick
3;31;13903;102;I am Bernardo, her most faithful one.’;kirkpatrick
3;31;13904;103;Like someone coming from Croatia, say,;kirkpatrick
3;31;13905;104;to view our Veil – the Saint Veronica –;kirkpatrick
3;31;13906;105;who still can’t satisfy the age-old ache;kirkpatrick
3;31;13907;106;and, while the image is displayed to him,;kirkpatrick
3;31;13908;107;will murmur in his thoughts: ‘My Lord, Christ Jesus, was;kirkpatrick
3;31;13909;108;this the way, true God, you looked on earth?’;kirkpatrick
3;31;13910;109;so I – with wondering eyes on that bright life;kirkpatrick
3;31;13911;110;of caritas who, contemplating, caught;kirkpatrick
3;31;13912;111;some taste, within our world, of ﬁnal peace.;kirkpatrick
3;31;13913;112;‘Child born of grace’ (so he began) ‘if you;kirkpatrick
3;31;13914;113;continue with your eyes still ﬁxed below,;kirkpatrick
3;31;13915;114;you’ll hear no note of this bright, joyful state.;kirkpatrick
3;31;13916;115;Look through these circles to the furthest oﬀ;kirkpatrick
3;31;13917;116;so far that you shall see, enthroned, the queen;kirkpatrick
3;31;13918;117;to whom this realm is subject in its vows.’;kirkpatrick
3;31;13919;118;I raised my eyes. And, as when morning dawns,;kirkpatrick
3;31;13920;119;the orient horizon in new light;kirkpatrick
3;31;13921;120;defeats the part in which the sun goes down,;kirkpatrick
3;31;13922;121;so too, as though my eyes were travelling;kirkpatrick
3;31;13923;122;from valley up to mountain peak, I saw;kirkpatrick
3;31;13924;123;the rim outdo, in brightness, every other part.;kirkpatrick
3;31;13925;124;As sky ﬂares ﬁercest where the chariot pole –;kirkpatrick
3;31;13926;125;mis-turned by Phaeton once – is waited for,;kirkpatrick
3;31;13927;126;the light diminishing on either side,;kirkpatrick
3;31;13928;127;so did that oriﬂamme (peace-pennant now);kirkpatrick
3;31;13929;128;grow bright within its central spur, as ﬂame,;kirkpatrick
3;31;13930;129;elsewhere, in equal measure, slacked and dimmed.;kirkpatrick
3;31;13931;130;And, in the central band, their wings outspread,;kirkpatrick
3;31;13932;131;I saw, in thousands, angels – feasting, dancing – in blaze;kirkpatrick
3;31;13933;132;and chosen deed all diﬀering.;kirkpatrick
3;31;13934;133;I saw there, smiling on their games and songs,;kirkpatrick
3;31;13935;134;the height of Beauty who, as height of Joy,;kirkpatrick
3;31;13936;135;was there in all the eyes of all the saints.;kirkpatrick
3;31;13937;136;And even if, in words, I had such wealth;kirkpatrick
3;31;13938;137;as, in imagining, I did, I’d still not dare;kirkpatrick
3;31;13939;138;attempt to say the least of that delight.;kirkpatrick
3;31;13940;139;Bernardo, seeing where my eyes were set,;kirkpatrick
3;31;13941;140;ﬁxed, won, attentive to her warm regard,;kirkpatrick
3;31;13942;141;now turned his own so feelingly to her;kirkpatrick
3;31;13943;142;that mine in wonder blazed out all the more.;kirkpatrick
3;32;13944;1;Heart-whole in pleasure, the contemplative;kirkpatrick
3;32;13945;2;freely took on himself the teacher’s role,;kirkpatrick
3;32;13946;3;beginning thus the holy words he spoke:;kirkpatrick
3;32;13947;4;‘The gash that Mary healed and soothed with oil;kirkpatrick
3;32;13948;5;was opened ﬁrst, and then made worse, by her;kirkpatrick
3;32;13949;6;who sits, so beautiful, at Mary’s feet.;kirkpatrick
3;32;13950;7;Ranked in the order that the third thrones form,;kirkpatrick
3;32;13951;8;lower than Eve, there Rachel sits. Along;kirkpatrick
3;32;13952;9;from her there is, as you see, Beatrice.;kirkpatrick
3;32;13953;10;Sara, Rebecca, Judith and the one;kirkpatrick
3;32;13954;11;who bore the mother of the man who sang,;kirkpatrick
3;32;13955;12;mourning his fault, the “Miserere mei” .;kirkpatrick
3;32;13956;13;Descending step to step, you see all these;kirkpatrick
3;32;13957;14;as I, in giving each her name, proceed,;kirkpatrick
3;32;13958;15;now travelling down this rose from leaf to leaf.;kirkpatrick
3;32;13959;16;And downward from the seventh of these tiers;kirkpatrick
3;32;13960;17;(as down to that) the Hebrew women come,;kirkpatrick
3;32;13961;18;dividing all the curls within that ﬂower.;kirkpatrick
3;32;13962;19;And these (according to the way their faith;kirkpatrick
3;32;13963;20;in Christ looked back or forth) here form the wall;kirkpatrick
3;32;13964;21;that separates the sacred steps in two.;kirkpatrick
3;32;13965;22;On that side, where the ﬂower is fully grown,;kirkpatrick
3;32;13966;23;with all its petals at their full extent,;kirkpatrick
3;32;13967;24;sit those who showed belief in Christ to come.;kirkpatrick
3;32;13968;25;There on the other side, where unﬁlled space;kirkpatrick
3;32;13969;26;still intersects the hemispheres, are those;kirkpatrick
3;32;13970;27;who turned their countenance to Christ now come.;kirkpatrick
3;32;13971;28;And where, on this side, there’s the glorious throne;kirkpatrick
3;32;13972;29;of Heaven’s own Lady and, below, those seats;kirkpatrick
3;32;13973;30;that, under hers, divide the rose in two,;kirkpatrick
3;32;13974;31;so, too, across from that, there sits great John.;kirkpatrick
3;32;13975;32;That saint bore desert and cruel martyrdom,;kirkpatrick
3;32;13976;33;then, after – till Christ came – two years in Hell;kirkpatrick
3;32;13977;34;And under him, elected to divide,;kirkpatrick
3;32;13978;35;Saint Francis, Benedict, Augustine, too,;kirkpatrick
3;32;13979;36;with others down to here, from rank to rank.;kirkpatrick
3;32;13980;37;Look up in wonder at God’s providence.;kirkpatrick
3;32;13981;38;He’ll ﬁll this garden to the same extent;kirkpatrick
3;32;13982;39;with those who kept the faith in these two ways.;kirkpatrick
3;32;13983;40;Know, too, that from the rung that, midway, strikes;kirkpatrick
3;32;13984;41;the line that marks these two divisions oﬀ,;kirkpatrick
3;32;13985;42;no one will sit by merit of their own –;kirkpatrick
3;32;13986;43;of others, rather, where conditions hold.;kirkpatrick
3;32;13987;44;For all of these are spirits loosed from earth;kirkpatrick
3;32;13988;45;before they, truly, could conceive free choice.;kirkpatrick
3;32;13989;46;And this, if you will look and listen hard,;kirkpatrick
3;32;13990;47;will be entirely clear to you. Just note;kirkpatrick
3;32;13991;48;their faces. Hear, as well, their children-voice.;kirkpatrick
3;32;13992;49;Now you’re in doubt and, doubting, do not speak.;kirkpatrick
3;32;13993;50;But I shall disentangle this tight knot,;kirkpatrick
3;32;13994;51;which your own subtle reasonings have tied.;kirkpatrick
3;32;13995;52;Within the broad expanse of all this realm;kirkpatrick
3;32;13996;53;there cannot be a single point that’s chance,;kirkpatrick
3;32;13997;54;nor any hunger, thirst or misery.;kirkpatrick
3;32;13998;55;For all that you may see is here decreed;kirkpatrick
3;32;13999;56;by God’s eternal law. Hence, right and ﬁt,;kirkpatrick
3;32;14000;57;all corresponds as ﬁnger to a ring.;kirkpatrick
3;32;14001;58;And so it is that, not without good cause,;kirkpatrick
3;32;14002;59;these children – sped too soon to this true life –;kirkpatrick
3;32;14003;60;are in their excellences less and more.;kirkpatrick
3;32;14004;61;The king, through whom this kingdom is at peace,;kirkpatrick
3;32;14005;62;in such great love, and in such pure delight,;kirkpatrick
3;32;14006;63;that nothing in our wills dare aim so high,;kirkpatrick
3;32;14007;64;creating, in his look of happiness,;kirkpatrick
3;32;14008;65;all minds, bestowed, as he best pleased, his grace;kirkpatrick
3;32;14009;66;in diﬀerent ways. The outcome says enough.;kirkpatrick
3;32;14010;67;And this, expressed and clear in Holy Writ,;kirkpatrick
3;32;14011;68;is noted in the case of those two twins;kirkpatrick
3;32;14012;69;who, in their mother’s womb, were moved to wrath.;kirkpatrick
3;32;14013;70;It follows from the colour of their hair;kirkpatrick
3;32;14014;71;to what degree of grace the highest light;kirkpatrick
3;32;14015;72;encrowns most ﬁttingly the head of each.;kirkpatrick
3;32;14016;73;Therefore, with no regard to how they act,;kirkpatrick
3;32;14017;74;these are placed here in diﬀering degrees;kirkpatrick
3;32;14018;75;by diﬀerence only of their ﬁrst sharp sight.;kirkpatrick
3;32;14019;76;In earliest times, it used to be enough,;kirkpatrick
3;32;14020;77;to gain salvation, that with innocence;kirkpatrick
3;32;14021;78;parental faith alone should be conjoined.;kirkpatrick
3;32;14022;79;Then, when these early epochs were complete,;kirkpatrick
3;32;14023;80;all males were circumcised to win them powers;kirkpatrick
3;32;14024;81;appropriate to their wings of innocence.;kirkpatrick
3;32;14025;82;But, later, when the age of grace arrived,;kirkpatrick
3;32;14026;83;such innocence – when baptism in Christ;kirkpatrick
3;32;14027;84;was not fulﬁlled – was bound on Hell’s ﬁrst rim.;kirkpatrick
3;32;14028;85;Return now. See that face resembling Christ;kirkpatrick
3;32;14029;86;closer than all. For that bright light alone;kirkpatrick
3;32;14030;87;can make you wholly ﬁt to look on Christ.’;kirkpatrick
3;32;14031;88;I saw such happiness rain down on her,;kirkpatrick
3;32;14032;89;borne by those holy intellects – made ﬁrst;kirkpatrick
3;32;14033;90;to ﬂy with wings across that heavenly height –;kirkpatrick
3;32;14034;91;that nothing I had ever seen before;kirkpatrick
3;32;14035;92;had brought my wondering eyes to such a poise,;kirkpatrick
3;32;14036;93;nor shown so much to me of how God looks.;kirkpatrick
3;32;14037;94;And that ﬁrst angel-love, descending there,;kirkpatrick
3;32;14038;95;was singing – wings extended in her sight –;kirkpatrick
3;32;14039;96;‘Ave Maria gratia plena’ .;kirkpatrick
3;32;14040;97;There answered this the sacred cantilene;kirkpatrick
3;32;14041;98;from every region of the happy court.;kirkpatrick
3;32;14042;99;At which, their faces showed the more serene.;kirkpatrick
3;32;14043;100;‘O holy father, who for me could bear;kirkpatrick
3;32;14044;101;to be down here and leave that lovely place;kirkpatrick
3;32;14045;102;where, as eternally decreed, you sit,;kirkpatrick
3;32;14046;103;which is that angel who, with such delight,;kirkpatrick
3;32;14047;104;looks at our Queen and gazes in her eyes;kirkpatrick
3;32;14048;105;so deep in love he seems to be on ﬁre?’;kirkpatrick
3;32;14049;106;I went, in this way, back to learn from him;kirkpatrick
3;32;14050;107;of one who drew his beauty from Maria,;kirkpatrick
3;32;14051;108;as, from the sun, the morning star draws light.;kirkpatrick
3;32;14052;109;‘All prowess, charm and elegance of heart;kirkpatrick
3;32;14053;110;as may appear in angels or men’s souls;kirkpatrick
3;32;14054;111;is found in him, and we all wish it so.;kirkpatrick
3;32;14055;112;For he it is who carried down the palm;kirkpatrick
3;32;14056;113;to Mary when the only Son of God;kirkpatrick
3;32;14057;114;chose to take on the weight of human form.;kirkpatrick
3;32;14058;115;But come now, note and follow with your eyes,;kirkpatrick
3;32;14059;116;as I go speaking, all the noble sires;kirkpatrick
3;32;14060;117;of this supremely true imperium.;kirkpatrick
3;32;14061;118;These two who sit above – the happiest,;kirkpatrick
3;32;14062;119;in being nearest to the Empress throne –;kirkpatrick
3;32;14063;120;are as the double root-stock of this rose.;kirkpatrick
3;32;14064;121;He who sits next in justice, to her left,;kirkpatrick
3;32;14065;122;is that ﬁrst father through whose reckless taste;kirkpatrick
3;32;14066;123;the human species tasted so much gall.;kirkpatrick
3;32;14067;124;There on the right you see the honoured sire;kirkpatrick
3;32;14068;125;of Holy Church to whom Christ left in trust;kirkpatrick
3;32;14069;126;the keys to this most delicate of ﬂowers.;kirkpatrick
3;32;14070;127;And he who saw, before he came to die,;kirkpatrick
3;32;14071;128;the heavy times of that beloved bride,;kirkpatrick
3;32;14072;129;ﬁrst won upon the Cross with lance and nails,;kirkpatrick
3;32;14073;130;sits next to him, and next to him now rests;kirkpatrick
3;32;14074;131;that lord beneath whose guidance there once lived;kirkpatrick
3;32;14075;132;a race ungrateful, shifting, obstinate.;kirkpatrick
3;32;14076;133;Across from Peter, as you see, sits Anne,;kirkpatrick
3;32;14077;134;so happy as she wonders at her child;kirkpatrick
3;32;14078;135;she does not move her eyes to sing “Hosanna”.;kirkpatrick
3;32;14079;136;And facing Adam, father of our tribe,;kirkpatrick
3;32;14080;137;Lucia sits. When you, in ruin, bent your brows,;kirkpatrick
3;32;14081;138;Lucia moved that donna to your aid.;kirkpatrick
3;32;14082;139;But since your time of slumber races by,;kirkpatrick
3;32;14083;140;at this point we shall end, as tailors do –;kirkpatrick
3;32;14084;141;who skilfully make skirts from little cloth.;kirkpatrick
3;32;14085;142;And turn your eyes towards the Primal Love,;kirkpatrick
3;32;14086;143;so that, in looking there, your eye should pierce;kirkpatrick
3;32;14087;144;as far as possible His dazzling light.;kirkpatrick
3;32;14088;145;But lest it be, perhaps, on your frail wings,;kirkpatrick
3;32;14089;146;thinking you rise beyond, you sink back down,;kirkpatrick
3;32;14090;147;it’s best that, praying for the gift of grace,;kirkpatrick
3;32;14091;148;you beg for grace from her who can assist.;kirkpatrick
3;32;14092;149;And here you’ll follow me with such good heart;kirkpatrick
3;32;14093;150;that from my words your feelings won’t depart.’;kirkpatrick
3;32;14094;151;And so he now began his holy prayer.;kirkpatrick
3;33;14095;1;‘Virgin and mother, daughter of your son,;kirkpatrick
3;33;14096;2;greater than all in honour and humility,;kirkpatrick
3;33;14097;3;you are the point that truth eternally;kirkpatrick
3;33;14098;4;is ﬁxed upon. And you have made the nature;kirkpatrick
3;33;14099;5;of the human being proud. Its maker, then,;kirkpatrick
3;33;14100;6;did not disdain to make himself his making.;kirkpatrick
3;33;14101;7;Love, in your womb, was fanned to ﬁre again.;kirkpatrick
3;33;14102;8;And here, in this eternal peace, the warmth of love has;kirkpatrick
3;33;14103;9;brought the Rose to germinate and bloom.;kirkpatrick
3;33;14104;10;You are, for us, the noon-time torch of love.;kirkpatrick
3;33;14105;11;You are, among those mortals there below,;kirkpatrick
3;33;14106;12;the clearest fountain of their living hopes.;kirkpatrick
3;33;14107;13;You are, in dignity and power, Our Lady.;kirkpatrick
3;33;14108;14;All who, in wanting grace, do not seek help;kirkpatrick
3;33;14109;15;from you, might wish to soar yet lack the wings.;kirkpatrick
3;33;14110;16;Nor in your kindness do you give your aid;kirkpatrick
3;33;14111;17;to those alone who ask, but often run,;kirkpatrick
3;33;14112;18;before they ask, to them in generous freedom.;kirkpatrick
3;33;14113;19;In you is pity, in you compassion,;kirkpatrick
3;33;14114;20;in you all-giving power. All good in you;kirkpatrick
3;33;14115;21;is gathered up that creature-form can bear.;kirkpatrick
3;33;14116;22;This man is one who, from the deepest void;kirkpatrick
3;33;14117;23;in all the universe, has seen thus far,;kirkpatrick
3;33;14118;24;and one by one, all lives in spirit-mode.;kirkpatrick
3;33;14119;25;To you, a suppliant, he comes, and asks;kirkpatrick
3;33;14120;26;that, by your grace, he gains the strength to rise in sight;kirkpatrick
3;33;14121;27;more, still to greet the ﬁnal peace.;kirkpatrick
3;33;14122;28;I never burned for visions of my own;kirkpatrick
3;33;14123;29;more than I do that he might see. To you;kirkpatrick
3;33;14124;30;I oﬀer all my prayers – praying my prayers;kirkpatrick
3;33;14125;31;are not too few – that you should free this man;kirkpatrick
3;33;14126;32;from all the clouds of his mortality,;kirkpatrick
3;33;14127;33;so highest happiness be shown to him.;kirkpatrick
3;33;14128;34;Our Queen, to you, who may do what you will,;kirkpatrick
3;33;14129;35;I also pray you keep him (he has seen;kirkpatrick
3;33;14130;36;so much!) healthy in all his heart intends.;kirkpatrick
3;33;14131;37;Watch, and defeat the impulses of man.;kirkpatrick
3;33;14132;38;See! Beatrice with so many saints;kirkpatrick
3;33;14133;39;closes her hands in prayers along with mine.’;kirkpatrick
3;33;14134;40;The eyes – which God both loves and venerates –;kirkpatrick
3;33;14135;41;attentive to these orisons, made clear;kirkpatrick
3;33;14136;42;how welcome to her were these holy prayers;kirkpatrick
3;33;14137;43;and then turned straight to the eternal light;kirkpatrick
3;33;14138;44;in which (we’re bound to think) no creature’s eye inwardly;kirkpatrick
3;33;14139;45;travels with such clarity.;kirkpatrick
3;33;14140;46;And drawing nearer, as I had to now,;kirkpatrick
3;33;14141;47;the end of all desires, in my own self;kirkpatrick
3;33;14142;48;I ended all the ardour of desire.;kirkpatrick
3;33;14143;49;Now Bernard, smiling, made a sign to me;kirkpatrick
3;33;14144;50;that I look up. Already, though, I was,;kirkpatrick
3;33;14145;51;by my own will, as he desired I be.;kirkpatrick
3;33;14146;52;My sight, becoming pure and wholly free,;kirkpatrick
3;33;14147;53;entered still more, then more, along the ray;kirkpatrick
3;33;14148;54;of that one light which, of itself, is true.;kirkpatrick
3;33;14149;55;Seeing, henceforward, was far more than speech –;kirkpatrick
3;33;14150;56;yielding before the sight I saw – can show.;kirkpatrick
3;33;14151;57;Mind’s memory yields, outraged at that beyond.;kirkpatrick
3;33;14152;58;Like those who see so clearly while they dream;kirkpatrick
3;33;14153;59;that marks of feeling, when their dreaming ends, remain,;kirkpatrick
3;33;14154;60;though nothing more returns to mind,;kirkpatrick
3;33;14155;61;so I am now. For nearly all I saw;kirkpatrick
3;33;14156;62;has gone, even if, still, within my heart,;kirkpatrick
3;33;14157;63;there drops the sweetness that was born from that.;kirkpatrick
3;33;14158;64;So, too, in sunlight, snow will lose its seal.;kirkpatrick
3;33;14159;65;So, too, the oracles the Sibyl wrote;kirkpatrick
3;33;14160;66;on weightless leaves are lost upon the wind.;kirkpatrick
3;33;14161;67;You raise yourself so far, O highest light,;kirkpatrick
3;33;14162;68;above our dying thoughts! Now lend once more;kirkpatrick
3;33;14163;69;some little part of what it seemed you were,;kirkpatrick
3;33;14164;70;and make my tongue suﬃcient in its powers;kirkpatrick
3;33;14165;71;that it may leave at least one telling spark;kirkpatrick
3;33;14166;72;of all your glory to a future race.;kirkpatrick
3;33;14167;73;Returning somewhat to my memory,;kirkpatrick
3;33;14168;74;re-echoing a little in my verse,;kirkpatrick
3;33;14169;75;your triumph over all will be more known.;kirkpatrick
3;33;14170;76;As I believe, the sharp light I sustained;kirkpatrick
3;33;14171;77;in that live ray was such that, if I’d turned;kirkpatrick
3;33;14172;78;away, eyes blurring, I’d have lost my track.;kirkpatrick
3;33;14173;79;And therefore (I remember this) I grew;kirkpatrick
3;33;14174;80;the braver as I bore that light, and joined;kirkpatrick
3;33;14175;81;the look I had to that unending might.;kirkpatrick
3;33;14176;82;Grace, in all plenitude, you dared me set;kirkpatrick
3;33;14177;83;my seeing eyes on that eternal light;kirkpatrick
3;33;14178;84;so that all seeing there achieved its end.;kirkpatrick
3;33;14179;85;Within in its depths, this light, I saw, contained,;kirkpatrick
3;33;14180;86;bound up and gathered in a single book,;kirkpatrick
3;33;14181;87;the leaves that scatter through the universe –;kirkpatrick
3;33;14182;88;beings and accidents and modes of life,;kirkpatrick
3;33;14183;89;as though blown all together in a way;kirkpatrick
3;33;14184;90;that what I say is just a simple light.;kirkpatrick
3;33;14185;91;This knotting-up of universal form;kirkpatrick
3;33;14186;92;I saw, I’m sure of that. For now I feel,;kirkpatrick
3;33;14187;93;in saying this, a gift of greater joy.;kirkpatrick
3;33;14188;94;One single point in trauma is far more,;kirkpatrick
3;33;14189;95;for me, than those millennia since sail;kirkpatrick
3;33;14190;96;made Neptune marvel under Argos-shade.;kirkpatrick
3;33;14191;97;And so my mind, held high above itself,;kirkpatrick
3;33;14192;98;looked on, intent and still, in wondering awe;kirkpatrick
3;33;14193;99;and, lit by wonder, always ﬂared anew.;kirkpatrick
3;33;14194;100;We all become, as that light strikes us, such;kirkpatrick
3;33;14195;101;we cannot (this would be impossible);kirkpatrick
3;33;14196;102;consent to turn and seek some other face.;kirkpatrick
3;33;14197;103;For good – the only object of our will –;kirkpatrick
3;33;14198;104;is gathered up entire in that one light.;kirkpatrick
3;33;14199;105;Outside it, all is ﬂawed that’s perfect there.;kirkpatrick
3;33;14200;106;And now my spark of words will come more short –;kirkpatrick
3;33;14201;107;even of what I still can call to mind –;kirkpatrick
3;33;14202;108;than baby tongues still bathing in mum’s milk.;kirkpatrick
3;33;14203;109;But not because that living light on which,;kirkpatrick
3;33;14204;110;in wonder, I now ﬁxed my eyes showed more;kirkpatrick
3;33;14205;111;than always as before and one sole sight.;kirkpatrick
3;33;14206;112;Rather, as sight in me, yet looking on,;kirkpatrick
3;33;14207;113;grew ﬁner still, one single showing-forth;kirkpatrick
3;33;14208;114;(me, changing mutely) laboured me more near.;kirkpatrick
3;33;14209;115;Within the being – lucid, bright and deep –;kirkpatrick
3;33;14210;116;of that high brilliance, there appeared to me;kirkpatrick
3;33;14211;117;three circling spheres, three-coloured, one in span.;kirkpatrick
3;33;14212;118;And one, it seemed, was mirrored by the next;kirkpatrick
3;33;14213;119;twin rainbows, arc to arc. The third seemed ﬁre, and;kirkpatrick
3;33;14214;120;breathed to ﬁrst and second equally.;kirkpatrick
3;33;14215;121;How short mere speaking falls, how faint against;kirkpatrick
3;33;14216;122;my own idea. And this idea, compared;kirkpatrick
3;33;14217;123;to what I saw…well, ‘little’ hardly squares.;kirkpatrick
3;33;14218;124;Eternal light, you sojourn in yourself alone.;kirkpatrick
3;33;14219;125;Alone, you know yourself. Known to yourself,;kirkpatrick
3;33;14220;126;you, knowing, love and smile on your own being.;kirkpatrick
3;33;14221;127;An inter-circulation, thus conceived,;kirkpatrick
3;33;14222;128;appears in you like mirrored brilliancy.;kirkpatrick
3;33;14223;129;But when a while my eyes had looked this round,;kirkpatrick
3;33;14224;130;deep in itself, it seemed – as painted now,;kirkpatrick
3;33;14225;131;in those same hues – to show our human form.;kirkpatrick
3;33;14226;132;At which, my sight was set entirely there.;kirkpatrick
3;33;14227;133;As some geometer may ﬁx his mind;kirkpatrick
3;33;14228;134;to ﬁnd a circle-area, yet lack,;kirkpatrick
3;33;14229;135;in thought, the principle his thoughts require,;kirkpatrick
3;33;14230;136;likewise with me at this sight seen so new.;kirkpatrick
3;33;14231;137;I willed myself to see what ﬁt there was,;kirkpatrick
3;33;14232;138;image to circle, how this all in-where’d.;kirkpatrick
3;33;14233;139;But mine were wings that could not rise to that,;kirkpatrick
3;33;14234;140;save that, with this, my mind, was stricken through by;kirkpatrick
3;33;14235;141;sudden lightning bringing what it wished.;kirkpatrick
3;33;14236;142;All powers of high imagining here failed.;kirkpatrick
3;33;14237;143;But now my will and my desire were turned,;kirkpatrick
3;33;14238;144;as wheels that move in equilibrium,;kirkpatrick
